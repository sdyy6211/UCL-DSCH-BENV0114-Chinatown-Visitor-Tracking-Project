"great job, friendly nail technician, good job on a straightforward manicure and patient with me when i botched one nail and it needed fixing.  open late.  did not 'over-sell' me - i walked in asking for a manicure and she took a look and said i only really needed a polish change.  will definitely go again next time i'm in london.",5
love love love these girls ,5
good service,4
ok,3
"great little shop under hair salon. charming ladies, did a great job, very quickly too! ",5
adriana did my nails and i loved it! these bunch are so lovely and you will instantly feel so welcomed the moment u walk in! just be aware that the shop is underground so you need to find le salon shop then they should be able to direct you to where 3d nails is ,5
"fiza is amazing, she's very friendly and smiling all the time. i had shellac manicure that took her 15 mns to do it although it usually takes at least 40 mns, but she's so efficiend and quick. i went in randomly and she received me without an appointment. i highly recommend her.",5
great service but the polish had already come off most of my nails i am absolutely gutted i paid a lot of money for my nails for my holiday and i'm going to have to get them repainted even before i go on holiday! it's only been two days.,3

"joy did my nails. she was so lovely! very kind, funny and professional. i had a lovely experience and each nail was perfect :) ive never had gel nails that have lasted this long either... got so many compliments! would definitely recommend this place.",5
fiza is amazing ! she helps you choose the best for your nails and i visit her after 5 years when i visit london ,5
the first place ive trusted to do my very thick eyebrows in two years! such a fun little salon,5
"it is really good. i was there a few months back and just searched it up again to make an appointment for the next day. not that often in london, but if you are there, they are the best",5
"first time in london. looking for a manicure and pedicure and stumbled upon this place. i lucked out! it is a little tricky to find as it is in the basement of a hair salon. these women know what theyre doing! ana, did an excellent job  and was so sweet :-) everyone was very friendly despite being extremely busy!",5
got my nails done today - adriana did a great job and was really friendly and chatty which im not used to in nail salons!! 10/10 - will return when im next in london!!,5
"definitely going back, had a lovely nude shellac colour on my natural nails.. the ladies accepted my last minute booking and were so friendly great job",5
"(i love the energy in this shop! very classic family spot like the places my mother used to take me to)not only that, the nails are great, shape and filing is important, and 3dnails has the time and imtimacy to give you a good look and feel. visit if you work in the city!",5
a real gem of a salon.  fiza and her team are amazing.  skilled nail technicians that are spot on with recommendations and gel manicures.  make you feel very welcome indeed and understand when you need to be super quick on a lunch break.  highly recommended.,5
best service ever. fiza and her team are brilliant and professional. they made my nails look great every time! never get bored or disappointed from them. highly recommended!,5
got my nails done for my graduation :) the staff are all so friendly and warm! theyre also super experienced and my nails came out so amazing and lovely ! very worth the prices considering the quality !!!,5
"plain rude! started painting my nails without giving me colour options. asked for a polish easy to remove, she painted my nails with gel nail polish. 35 absolutely not worth it, and it was supposed to be a treat, felt really disrespected. go somewhere else!",1
adriana did an excellent pedicure.  loved it,5
came in as a walk in this afternoon and had a great manicure. shes lovely too and it was a relaxing experience in the middle of china town,5
"good services, professionals staff. highly recommend.",5

i have been coming here regularly for years. nails last forever. fiza and team are the best. professional and friendly. highly recommend!,5
"fiza and her staff are the best nail artists i have encountered. i am from california, and my first stop whenever in the u.k. is fiza's salon. in addition to their undeniable artistic talent, the staff are so sweet and accommodating. nobody else touches my nails! i envy locals for being so near the best nail salon around. go see fiza!!",5
"amazing place, lovely staff!! called up as they were about to close and she kindly stayed open to sort me and my friend out. will be back!!!",5
wow very nice nails done  amazing don't miss out this place,5
so glad i found this place! a bit tricky to find as it's downstairs from a hair salon - but absolutely worth it. they were able to fit me in as a walk in and did a great job. they seem to know most of their clientele and bring a really personal touch. make sure to bring cash!,5
"lovely, welcoming and talented nail technicians! first place ive found that could do the nail art i wanted~ so happy with my nails, will definitely be back again. thank you! ",5

"i work locally and i wanted to find good nail place around. after checking local places i think that this one is best. service is always outstanding, crew really great and atmosphere is nice. i totally recommend this place to everybody!",5
"i went yesterday to fix a nail disaster. i got an appointment straight away, all the technicians were funny and lovely. it was a wonderful experience, professional and my nails look absolutely beautiful. finally found a great nail salon that i will be returning too !!!!",5
"i'm very happy with how the nails look, how i was treated and how quickly it went. couldn't be more pleased. -16 years old girl from norway:)",5
hong kong style dessert found in london. quite nice.,4
great place to get durian deserts,5
"worse worse worse desserts shop. matcha cake tasteless. barley kumara porridge coconut milk is out of date, so you can taste sour. spheres edge is tasteless as well. and the service is bad as well. never ever visit again even it is free.",1
"awful food, rude service, overpricednot authentic is one thing, not edible is another.save yourself from ruining a good time - avoid this place",1
rude customer service and awful dessert first time and 'never again'. there are much better places in chinatown then this place.,1
walked in and we were completely ignored by the waiters for about 5 minutes so we walked out instead.,1
"not bad desserts, pricey.cash only.comfy seating area.no toilets.",3
delicious ! super positive! surprise!!,5
"very small shop. very overpriced for what you get. the ""h8"" sesame dessert is very disappointing, it seems as if it is ready made from powder. there is no toilet either.",1
"nice food, but the waitress was rude and snappy.",2
"the service girl treated everyone so bad, absolutely the worst setvice in leicester square area.",1
i had a bingsoo with my friend on summer and it was good enough. however they served another kind of bingsoo with lack of milk. the visual and size is appealing. the cafe itself was nice and cute.,3
"bad service and food, no service at all but they charge service charge!? food isn't freshly made and far from the menu, overpriced and tasteless",1
4 of us went. 3 out of 4 desserts ordered are disappointing and the 4th one is just average. hot desserts are not hot enough; the mango pancake has too much cream and too little mango. they are not very efficient either,2
"the waitress were very nice and kind, even though one of them was learning english and didn't know much. the strawberry milkshake is the best that i ever tried, good price and feels like you are not in london but in china. the decoration is superb, we need more places like this.",5
"millecrepe at 7.99 - not great. like all the reviews, over priced and not a patch on kova. when are we going to get a proper chinese dessert restaurant that london deserves?",2
"8 for a slice of mille crepe cake!!! and cash only?? cake was fine but wow, that's crazy pricing. staff weren't friendly either.",2
"expensive mille crepe which wasn't as good as kova. additionally, cash only with a service charge for seating me and bringing me a cake. what a joke. avoid at all costs",1
"very pricey for the size of the portions. they only accept cash without even telling you where the nearest atm is (which is far, btw). and overall they are rude.",2
new dessert hong kong dessert place in chinatown. wide selection but quite stingy with the mango as quite a big difference with the image. reasonable service but i know a few other places i would choose over this one.,3
overrated. very small servings. very exorbitantly expensive. not very good. candy cafe is much better for the same desserts.,1
poor services. we have been waiting for 20 minutes for our desserts. when my friend asked the staff 2 times to check our order and she stared at us without any apologizes (even her manager was sitting next to us and she kept using her computer without saying anything) . never come back again.,1
"4/6 items we asked for was either unavailable, sold out or missing ingredients...  very disappointing.  service wasn't great, the waitress lacked enthusiasm, gave the vibe that she can't be bothered and only when i pay to tell me cash only...  not sure if i will go back any time soon.",1
very impressive and delicious fruit dessert   ,5
love the durian shaved ice here. only few places in london to have durian desserts.,4
we were visiting chinatown from canada and this dessert shop .what a great find. the staff are amazing! the dessert are also amazing! staff made us feel so welcome each time we were there. an amazing atmosphere and we would highly recommend this establishment to everyone!,5
"lovely intimate little venue perfect for a date.we had some excellent fruit dessert,it was a life changing experience.highly recommend this place.",5
love the dessert! found this shop by accident but it surprised me! definitely will go back again next time. mango ice was great!,5
very good food and good communication with customers. recommended  10000% love it,5
"the best dessert  ive tried! great choice,interesting tastes.",5
very friendly and helpful staff looked after us.his recommendation were perfect and matched exactly what we expected.we had a comfortable and nice experience and would like to go back again.,5
"overpriced, inattentive service, cash only.there's much better places for shaved ice and tapioca desserts in london.",3
great food at reasonable prices. amazing atmosphere interior was beautiful.not accept  america express card.,5
"this is a wonderful place,full of the buzz of being in london .desserts were incredible,waiters were very attentive.",5
friendly service delicious dessert its okay to open a few more shop!,5
they charged service charge ??? without any service ?? ok,1
service is too bad. we try to enjoy the food but the attitude of the waitor is too annoying!!!,1
great dessert.seating section was great.amazing atmosphere.everything was well organised.,5
"no air condistion in hot weathertookaway a mango cake and when i back home, the cake looked like thiswhat a jokethe cake costs 7 pounds!",1
"very bad service. staff are talking loud when they making the food. and they even charge 12.5% of bill for service charge,where this confidence comes from?",1
"awful service, disappointing waitress who was not only disrespectful but filled with attitude. slow service. desserts came out completely different to what was advertised and was so bad that we had to walk out.",1
"not all drinks were cold as we expected. the flavours of the drinks, smoothies and ice cream were okay though.the whole place smelled like durian. eventually the smell become less strong till i don't notice it anymore.",3
diverse and extensive asian dessert menu - well worth a visit to sample.,4
great dessert service is very good,5
"had a horrible time here - do not order ""ginger milk"" as they literally just mix ginger and milk and serve it as a liquid.",1
"good desserts, drinks are ok but its but a tad pricey",4
bad quality food and bad service. very disappointed,1
"super cute caf and delicious desserts! a bit pricey tho, but the location is very cosy",4
amazing freshly fruit dessert.... the best hong kong style dessert in uk!!!,5
"the most amazing mango ice cream  in soho, london. share with a loved one!",5
"i came here for the durian desserts because i love durian!! we had the durian shaved ice one, and it was so good. i will definitely be coming back to try the other desserts!",5
great spot in china town for spicy sichuan food. waiter was excellent in offering recommendations. cash only.,4
"great authentic dishes, great presentation of food. the chilli beef and bamboo shoots and whole sea bass were great!",5
cool restaurant with excellent food at reasonable prices. not suitable for massive groups as you may find the seats uncomfortable. it's perfect for quick authentic chinese dinner. ,5
communist decor. good food. affordable too. what more could you want?,4
food is too expensive and service too bad. cash only!!!!!!!! no card!!!!!!,2
"this place used to be amazing. the new menu is poor, terrible in fact. seems like an attempt to sell tiny dishes at old prices but they've made them worse too. all the best dishes like fish fragrant aubergine, cumin lamb, green beans with mince pork and garlic and twice cooked szechuan pork are gone. please bring the old menu back!",2
place is very small but the food is good!,4
"small, busy and buzzing. small dishes, fresh flavours and beautiful presentation - wonderful! gets busy and there is a 12 per head minimum charge.",4
"once we he most amazing chinese in soho, now it's very poor. but still expensive.",1
"its small and cozy, with good staff and very tasty food. the twice cooked pork is superb. go here!",4
"this place had a changed menu and possibly change of management, and the quality of the food dropped - but its great again. very affordable, and genuine chinese cuisine. one of the best places in chinatown - highly recommended!",5
very authentic chinese~spicy food guaranteed,5
"very mediocre and overpriced food. rude, grumpy and dismissive service. ",1
a cosy and welcome stop during my wander around london.,4
"perfectly decent food, price a bit high for quality",3
would've been nice if they brought me my meal. would've been ok if they brought it after us telling them.,2
great authentic chinese food,5
authentic and tasty sichuan restaurant with fast and friendly service,5
"great szechuan dishes bursting with amazing tastes of china in a small restaurant that will make you feel as if your were transported to a rural town in china. service was also patient and friendly. prawn, chicken and pork dishes were great. lamb dish was less successful. they have great teas too!",4
"authentic sichuan cooking, fried fish in chilli oil and shredded tofu  was amazing!",5
good food at reasonable prices and large quantities. would come again.,4
authentic sichuan food at a very reasonable price. we were a group of 6 and had to wait 15 minutes to sit down but it was worth it. everything was delicious but the cauliflower stir fry and the fried pork belly were amazing!,5
"i love the traditional spicy dumplings in broth. they are ridiculously spicy and soooo tasty. no alcohol here and simple, no messing vibe.",5
the mao cai is mouth tingling excellent,5
delicious and authentic. the dishes definitely reminded me of home. the dishes were served quickly and the service was top notch. definitely recommend.,5
ok sichuan food. quick service but without a smile or warmth. and would not accept card payment for an 80 pound bill. had to walk down to the local atm to get cash to pay. my local kebab house and chinese takeaway even take card payments!!,2
"one of my favourite restaurants in london; serves authentic chinese food for a reasonable price. also serve super quickly so its very ideal for the ever hungry person!! every dish ive tried has been really good, highly recommend the .",5
my favourite place for chinese food in chinatown. it tastes amazing!,5
portions were way to smallwould not recommend for families,1
i ate  my first time there and i must say the food was  very tasty.  will definitely come back ,5
"always go here when im in london. great place , great food. good spicy food. authentic.",5
"server refused to take an order for another dish saying ""you can only order once"", and that stupid policy is not listed/specified anywhere. average food. don't waste your time or money here, as they don't value your money as paying customers.",1
overpriced!!!!! - tasty enough and quick but 12 quid for what seemed half a dish. get yourself to silk road in camberwell.,2
"worst customer service ever !!!! they don't realise we actually pay for the food and not the other way round. not sure who the hell runs this place ... i will never return nor recommend th place , in fact would talk about this to all my friends who visit china town!!",1
"some dishes (vegetables) were really good, most of the meats were just mediocre. come for the spicy food, but only if you're craving something spicy. wouldn't go out of my way to come back here.",3
excellent hotpot.,5
"one of the best gems in chinatown to eat. really daring and inspiring dishes on the menu and off the main, busy strip",5
nice place but they need to improve their service,2
"one of my favourite sichuan restaurant in china town, delicious. most important of all, it is value for money!",4
great little place with tasty dishes at reasonable prices.,4
best dim sum.,5
best restaurant in the world meneu verry good and fast team i like it verry much,5
not recommended. this place is trash. the waitress was rude and the food was dirty and worst taste. ,1
the service and the tastes of the foods became worse compare with last year when i visited. the sauce of the fish smells and tastes good but the fish was tasteless. i agree with the other reviews that the male waiter was rude to customer and he kept talking to another waitress which was quite annoying to us.,2
"really good szechuan food nice staff unusual for china town, good prices",5
taste bud overload. if youve never tried it go for it. but be prepared for an other world experience in dining.,4
highly recommendable place for chinese food. excellent dishes are served with a variety of szechuan flavours and spices. the service is also very good. try the homemade plum juice! it goes perfectly with spicy dishes. ,5
"this was my most frequent choice in china town. very affordable and very busy, so didn't expect too much of service, until today we encountered a very rude waiter, slim and middle aged man, i don't want to go back ever again. ",2
"great if you want szechuan style cooking, one of the best for it in london. decently priced and the service is what you expect in chinatown. can get crowded but i like the food a lot",5
"delicious! we ordered a bunch of dishes to share, and it was perfect. it was our first time trying all of the food we had. perfect amount of spice and flavor. ",5
"always been one of the better regional chinese restaurants in london although i note the dish size has shrunk while the prices have creeped up. pretty poor service, as per most chinatown restaurants, and cash only.",4
"i was there last saturday with some friends. we ordered 4 different dishes, and everything was delicious. the place is now starred on my google maps :)",5
 recommend to all if u are looking for traditional spicy food.  i really love this place. used to come for lunch all the time. thought i'd leave a nice msg since the staff were treating me well ,5
"i always love food there but they have change the menu and new business idea, in fact i did not enjoy that much like i used to, i guess is ok.",3
"did not feel very authentic. the waiter we had was fine, but the food wasn't great for the price.",2
"i heard good things about this place but wasn't very impressed. i got the mouthwatering chicken ( very very good!) smacked cucumber, which was bland, don't really have any dressing that you would expect and dan dan noodles which were overcooked and claggy.",3
expensive. cash only. service was not great. didn't get all of the dishes we ordered. food was good.,2
the buns and pastries are good but bubble  waffle is very average.,4
lovely bakery place. variety of buns and cakes for good price. recommend a visit ,5
a good variety of sweet and savoury bread and cakes.,4
"favourite bakery ever. so much choice. they sell bubble waffles, taiyaki and have a huge selection of buns and pastries. the only reason why it isn't 5*s is because the queueing system is never made clear and you have to figure it out for yourself",4
"finally found a place that sells red bean taiyaki in london, and they are just as good as japan - highly recommended! also love the ice cream in fish shaped cones.",5
good bread very soft.. even sometimes long q.. but it worth...,5
great ice cream. the waffle was not so fluffy though,4
"one of best chinese bakeries in whole uk imo. always fresh, eye-candy buns and good prices. also always great assortment and availability, which is rare for bakeries. a ""must go"" place",5
delicious little fish shaped breads with custard filling. highly recommended! the minis are best.,5
"the woman there gave me fake change, was very rude and the ice cream wasn't that good",1
"i got the two types of big taiyaki, red bean and nutella. the dough is different from what im used to (chewy cakey), more glutinous inside and crispy outside. youd have to pay more for nutella, so id say go for the red bean unless you hate it! a nice little treat!ps. bread in shop looks gooood",4
"bad customer service. what they call a ""large"" taiyaki is pretty small for the price. the taiyaki with the red bean paste inside is good.",2
great location and delicious baked goods. the taiyaki soft serve with matcha vanilla blend ice cream is to die for.,5
so glad they are now sakurado matcha store,5
"taiyaki with green tea ice cream is nice, however the staff broke my cookie stick and did not change it...and staff team is not nice at all...they look like zombie, no smile, no emotions~",2
"as usual the ""custard fish"" went down a treat. they had run out of char siu baos, but it was late so not a surprise. the ice creams in a fish shaped cone were delicious.",4
unfortunately i did not enjoy the taiyaki... the dough was too stodgy on the inside of the large one and there was not much custard in the small ones. the bakery itself is also so packed and they seem in such a hurry to serve you.,2
"very disappointed, we found hair in our ice cream , we threw it immediately. the ice cream tastes normal.",1
"lovely place, they have a great selection of baked goods.taiyaki is the best thing you'll ever try in chinatown and i would recommend getting them here.i would love to give bake five stars but i found the lady on till was quite rude and abrupt.",4
"i've been there several times, the large variety is always fun to try and the food is really cheap so you end up leaving with a bag full of unique snacks, the one snack friends ask me to get everytime i go are those mini taiyaki so make sure you try them as well.",5
amazing fresh baked goods. highly recommend!,5
customer services was terrible.,1
very cool shop with the fish shaped cone for ice cream. ice cream is soft and nice. can get matcha or vanilla. other buns and food is for sale too,4
lots of variety of cakes and the teriyaki was very nice as well,5
cool place with speical ice cream cones,4
"matcha ice cream in fresh fish shaped waffle ""cone"" is delicious",5
"i love everything they offered. but i hate that one elder lady with the glasses!! i simply wanted a fresh taiyaki but she only said ""it's hot, it's hot"". i don't care if it's hot, it's not fresh!",2
staff at the till so rude to the customer....make an additional order and she was not happy and told me to go away.  so disgusting!!!,1
what a massive choice of fresh bread and bakes.,5
best bakery around. very close to w london hotel. i came here every morning of my trip. come here if looking for amazing baked goods and cheap prices. ,5
"i would queue here for 3 days to get a bag of their custard fish, surprisingly moreish.",5
"great variety, lots of flavors. the ice-creams and chocolate fish-shape waffle were enough to make you willing to get in and see the rest.",4
"i come here every time im in leicester square, without fail. tuna rolls are amazing. bread is so soft and the taiyaki is extraordinary not to mention how fresh the cakes are ",5
"the staff are not nice, the lady on the counter she was rood with usin fact they have a nice looking ice cream bubble and fish it does not taste nice! and the raspberry they used was not washed!i",2
"amazing chinese bakery and ice cream.lots of sweet, savoury options and cute animal cakes.perfect treat after a meal nearby.",5
"fun waffles with a generous serve of ice-cream, an orio and fresh fruit - every child's dream.",5
"great buns, reasonably priced.",4
"not fancy, but is just amazingly good. super cheap, really tasty variety of baked goods. would recommend the savoury food massively.",5
i tried the fish cone green tea and vanilla ice cream and the mini custard filled fishies. both were delicious.,5
the taiyaki ice cream is awesome. the matcha flavour is tasty. smooth creamy ice cream. the cone is crispy and slightly chewy. they give a generous amount of ice cream too. good value for 4. plus you can get a nice photo. they also sell a variety of chinese style bake goods.,5
the buns are amazing and heavenly good  again and again i am gonna go there ,5
"great food, especially the nutella fish shaped pancakes",5
"very old school chinese baked goods - tbh theyre probably a bit niche for most westerners, but i love their chicken floss buns and other assorted goodies such as light as air padan rolls. put them on a tray and then take them to the counter to pay and have them wrapped, or youll be told off.",5
"bake is a popular shop with ice cream, genuine chinese fresh baked goods (these are at a reasonable price). the staff is efficient and works fast. they sell the hyped matcha flavoured icy creamy goodness in an japanese taiyaki. it's good but as is with most hypes - overpriced.",4
"don't know about the buns, the ice cream was nice, the cake not so much.",4
gr8,5
fresh taiyaki made on site with choice of ice creams and fillings. also a good range of chinese pastries.,5
vanilla flavour was yummy and that fish shaped cone made it much more interesting.,4
"i got the green tea ice cream. beautiful presentation, flavor was a bit lacking (couldn't really taste the green tea/matcha), but the fish pastry was delicious. i got some buns last time and they were pretty soft and fresh.",4
"tea time,supreme. pastries, apple pie, choc fudge exquisite.we enjoy it !one more time. .",5
"fun asian bakery. lots of fun options at affordable prices. there's a slight language barrier which makes their customer service seem lacking. i thought the fish ice cream thing was gonna be a total gimmick (that i wanted to be a park of nevertheless), but turns out the green tea soft serve was quite tastey.",5
the food is nice. but the customer service is the worst! the woman who serves the ice cream was so nice! dont get me wrong. but the two people at the till. extremely rude and i have been thee twice. same person and same service from her. if you are ok with having nice food but rubbish service. this is the place for you.,1
"we were too full to try anything more then the green tea ice-cream. the gimmick of the fish is very cool, and tasty. the ice-cream is not too sweet, perfectly balanced. loved it, and would definitely try other things on my next visit.",5
small take-away asian bakery. loved the small fish shaped pasty that is lightly stuffed with custard.,4
best hk style bakery in chinatown! i always get char siu bao!,4
very good chinese buns. they are very creative and flavourful.,5
"always come here for lovely cake, i'd definitely recommend the matcha green tea ice cream with the fish cone! very delicious!!",5
tried the taiyaki with green tea ice cream.yummy! looked like they had a great selection of baked things.,5
sweet sweet! i love how they made their bakery so sweet. lst time i went spent almost 20!,5
yummy! definitely worth the wait,3
the egg custards were very delicious. we also bought pineapple flavored bread etc. they were all good.,4
"i don't even wanna give them 1star. the worst customer service ever.. (maybe the lady who i talked with was just really bad, and not rest of employees.) i don't usually write bad reviews, but this place was unbelievable. thank you for ruining my first london trip! i will never go back.",1
love the pistachio ice cream that comes in a fish waffle cone.,5
"got ripped off. clearly stated 'smallest, cheapest green tea possible'. got suspicious when they asked for receipt and didn't want to give it back. 2nd star for tea ice creme taste.",2
taiyaki  so delicious !! try it out,5
"it's one of the few authentic shops around leicester square. you can find a wide range of freshly baked products. it is always crowded, and you can't expect much of service, but you can help yourself with peace of mind through a self-service scheme.",5
so-so. nothing all that special. their soft served ice cream tastes no different than something you can find easily at mcdonalds. just tastes sweet and no other flavour. buns are alright.,3
good quality tasty food.,4
fantastic food and lovely service! we come back when next time in london,5
"amazing food, with dumplings prepared in the front. usually busy so book ahead, or go early.",5
food is nice.  love the dumplings.  but my favourite is the special fried rice.  the staff is nice.,4
the finest venue in china town,5
"really disappointed, the food has no taste and the waiters were really rude.",2
"we've been here a couple of times and the quality varies but this was the worst of the worst. zero szechuan in the szechuan chicken, rubbery squid and dried out crusty xiao long bao. i've had better food and service in a mall food court.",1
"shocking service, food that we did get was mediocre, bizarrely there was a queue at the door, this place sucks, don't go.",1
disappointing - mediocre xiaolongbao soup dumplings (we tried three kinds) and a zha jiang noodles that had a sauce that was watery. prices were ok and service was fine.,3
"great dumplings, made on site! fast service and at a good price. definitely worth a visit!",4
"did not impress me at all. my kung pao chicken was terrible, one of the worst i've ever eaten. the sweet and sour soup was ok but again nothing special. i guess i will have to stick to dumplings next time.",3
some of the best food i've had ( try the spicy pork xiao long bao ),5
"terrible service, only half our order after 40 minutes of waiting and then only the flimsiest of apologies. everyone else around use got served well in time yet we were sat with nothing. not good enough so walked out.",1
"amazing food, so so tasty. would go back everyday if i could!",5
best dumpling i have had.,5
"beijing dumpling is my favourite spot in chinatown and i can assume many share my opinion seeing that there is usually a queue out the door. it goes by fast, don't worry. amazing dumplings and amazing don don noodles. highly recommended!",5
good staff and yummy food.,5
solid dumpling spot. recommend.,5
nice place. maybe could offer more dim sum choices though.,4

"the food in this place is exquisitely delicious, and the atmosphere is excellent.",5
"really happy with this one. much nicer than the last dumpling place that i've visited a couple of months back. all the dishes were very good. dumplings, taiwanese fried chicken and some home made thick noodles. all goodbasement seems to be not suffer from the cooking of the dumplings creating a stuffy atmosphere at street level.",4
"lousy cooking skills aside, terrible service - so rude, so arrogant and so uncivilised.",1
"the food here is amazing. great service,excellent value for money",5
unbelievable choices for vegetarians. the dumplings are delicious and the salt and pepper tofu is super moorish.,5
"the dumplings are the only good thing here, rest of the menu is below average and the service is by far the worst i have experience in 7 years in london.",1
had the hot pot with spicy and corn broth - both good. good selection of seafood and meat.,5
"great food, they were very helpful with allergy advice. bit of a wait for a table.",4
below what i expected from the existing ratings and patron waiting outside.,3

"we had so much expectations walking in thinking we would get the xiao long bao(soup dumplings) filled with mouth burning broth, which is the main selling point of the restaurant, but we were disappointed slightly. the xlb had very little broth inside. but other dishes that we had weren't too bad.",3
"probably the best chinese food i have had in the uk. reasonable prices. good, fast service.",5
so so delicious. totally worth the wait!,5
ristorante buono degno delle 5 stelle,5

awesome food and service.,4
we have been going there for years. great dumplings and well worth queuing for,5

oh wow one of the best dumplings i have had in london and i live here and have been to lot of places in the neighborhood,5
"quirky menu takes you away from many of the english ""specials"" and leads to a more authentic and rustic meal. food good, the deep fired king prawns in egg yolk very good if a little salty. fast service, basic setting, but great value for money.",4
excellent food! and great atmosphere~ recommend the four season bean with minced pork...it's great!,5
"really disappointed, bad food",1
great place for dumplings and sharing plates. you can also book online which is great if you do not want to wait. best xiaolongbao in china town!,5

i loved the food. one of the best places in china town.,5

amazingly fresh and tasty! so reasonably priced too. good service.,5
"more like dumplings by dumplings. decent food however the service was terrible and ruined the experience. when we declined to pay the service charge, staff cursed us in chinese. !",1
this resto serves the traditional chinese fares but the dumplings are yummy. freshly made and reasonably priced too. went there on a weekday so seating was easy. i can imagine the difficulty going here on a weekend considering its location. service is average.,5
"nice place with very nice food and in good amount. fast service, you might cue if you come in peak hours. it could be 5 stars if the staff was less rude when serving the dish.",4
they are asking for 10 min spend per person without any notice.,1
"i went for the dumplings and i was disappointed, too thick and not enough filling. the rest was nice!!",3
"been to this couple of times and wow the food are amazing. tried different dumplings, the dry chicken noodle and the salt and pepper type chicken. they all had very authentic taste and seeing the chefs making the dumplings certainly adds to that experience. i would go back everytime i go to soho.",5
good dumplings f or central. men could do with better description though,4
"everything was soooo delicious! i really recommend the dan dan noodles and spicy pork dumplings (caution: they are filled with liquid, so just eat them in one go, don't bite through it!) the service is better than some other chinese restaurants",5
my 2nd favourite chinese restaurant in chinatown. great that you can see the dumplings being made on the window.i recommend getting the spicy aubergine dish. it's incredible.,5
delicous food,5
dumplings are not bad. reasonable price too.,3
very good taste.,5
food was very good but service was lacking.,4

fantastic place to eat in london,5
"tasty food, prepared with a lot of skill and care, and feels healthy. often there is a queue, but its worth the wait.",5
"some of the best chinese food i've had london. food comes quick, great selection and reasonably priced.",5
very good little restaurant.  great dumplings. gets busy which is a sign of quality.  would go back if i was dumpling hunting. the other food looked good too.,5
taste all right. bite sized too small.,2
"good service, great atmosphere and amazing food",5
we tried 3 dinners in the same area.  this one gives larger amounts (1.5-2x) than others while price a little lower.  serving time is a little quicker than others.  total 37 pound including tip,5
not the most friendly service...food alright but nothing worth remembering,2
awful service. planned to go for dinner on a sunday night after a theatre play. arrived at 9:15pm in 4 ppl and we were sent away for a supposedly closed kitchen. how is it possible that you close the kitchen more than 1h before closing?? really disappointed!!!,1
great service. got last spaces before queue started. fantastic food. well recommended,5
"great staff, delicious food and all in all very restful ambience",5
"great atmosphere, in the heart of china town. a variety of dumplings and other dishes, prompt service.",4

solid place to grab authentic chinese food near leicester square. change from the usual tourist traps!,5
"very good place to eat, ordered 6 different meals all of them was good",5
"gorgeous good, nice atmosphere, authentic and good service",5
"not even average. the food is so sweet it tastes of nothing but sugar. the weird dumplings have soup in them, look yellow and unappetising and taste weird. the service as expected in china town- no one really cares",1
food was delicious but the people serving forgot to bring 2 dishes we ordered it and they were not being nice. they should improve that to create a better atmosphere for the customer,3
"disappointed, as the skin was very thick and there was minimal amount of soup inside the dumplings.",2
amazing. best dumplings in london hands down. couldn't recommend more. go hungry as you will want to try everything,5
"busy place, the food is very decent.",4
"amazing dumplings!  even though sometimes you have to wait to get in, but it is definitelly worth waiting!",5
dumplings are great. rice is bad. the staff is horrible: rude and of no service at all.,2
"their menu says hot pot.. their window has an offer for hot pot... but when we asked for it, they said they don't even sell hot pot. since we had waited to sit and other restaurants had lines as well, we decided to eat anyway. the dumplings were bland and mediocre, and the rest of the food ranges from okay to bad. very unimpressed.",2
loved the food.,5
great stuff ,5
best place in china town,5
"i love this place. service is not great but food is delicious, great dumplings!!! one of the best in chinatown!!!",5
"pork xiu li bao, mapo tofu and firecracker chicken never disappoint. fair prices, delicious food.",5
"good was ok, a dumpling place which on a saturday evening doesn't have the full dumpling menu doesn't make much sense. it was also a bit late and they were kind of kicking us out when the restaurant ups was a bit full. not the greatest place and not the greatest food but prices looked quite affordable compared to the quality",3
the one and only dumpling master in london!best in town!,5
"amazing dumplings and beijing zhajiang noodle. the worse the service, the better the food :)",5
asian dim sum food. food came promptly and staff were helpful. my spicy dish was not very spicy and they were out of steamed dumplings when i went but it was quite late. the food was very tasty however. average price for chinatown,3
fantastic resteraunt. all the food was delicious and big portions. definitely going back.,5
"my favourite dumpling place in london! their soup dumplings are warm and delicious. they have quick, efficient service and its pretty cheap given its central location",5
"i have been coming here for 4 years now, the service is ok but the food is amazing.",5
"one of the best chinese restaurants in london and very good value. hand made pork dumplings and xiao long bao, the best combination ho fan in gravy sauce. service is usually efficient and not overly friendly which is what i expect and prefer at a chinese restaurant!",5
"really great food, for excellent value",5
delicious food and good prices.,5
had a lovely lunch although huge. chose the set menu and had too much food. everything tasted great though. will definitely visit again.,5

amazing food and great service. this is my favourite chinese restaurant. a little wait is necessary to be seated but overall i love it.,5
reasonably priced semi authentic chinese  food.,3
tasty food,5
food is decent and relatively cheap. nothing overly special but is a great catch non the less... been here 5 times over the last year or so and every time there was a queue going out the door onto the street.,4
"i used to love this place until it was shut down temporarily for rat and cockroach infestation. my heart says yes, but my head says no, never again!",2
a colleague recommended this restaurant. very good value for money. food is tasty and service is fast.,4
don t come for chicken,1
"the dumplings were really good!!! and the rice was on point... good service l, lots of options in the the menu, if you're in china town go eat here good food at affordable prices",4
such a treat and unexpected surprise. food came out quickly and immediately reflected significant effort. try the honey wings and bubble tea!,4
thier spicy pork dumplings are to die for,5
"very nice little restaurant in chinatown. the food is amazing. noodles and dumplings are homemade and the customers can see the chefs at work also from outside, very nice idea. good price for the food",5
very delicious!,5
"they wanted us to spend 10 per person, it is stupid for a place with typical noodle price is around 7",1
nice food!,5
"i went with a 9 and 5 yr old.  they loved it all. staff were attentive to them, food choices were uncomplicated but very tasty. went because we saw the ladies making the fresh dumplings in the window.  will return.",4
"very good food! if you also want a bit private, romantic atmosphere, this isnt probably for you. but i would come again anytime! :-)",4
t's michelin listed restaurant. not star but definitely good dimsum. also traditional chinese and affordable. the atmosphere is a little dodgy but taste excellent.,5
"food is good, place is hygienic..",4
"absolute love is this place.have tried all the dumplings here , its amazing!!never get bored of the food here. best dumplings in china town",5
speedy service and big fresh portions too. good value for money.,5
"incredible dim sum, best in chinatown. expect to queue outside for a table at peak times!",5
"fantastic. best in china town. dont miss the spicy pork or chicken dumplings - freshly made at the front of the shop. salt and pepper squid was also a standout - the squid was fresh and supple, not rubbery like most frozen variants. meal for two, with a beer each will cost you about 40, and youll eat very well.",5
"this is one of my favourites chinese restaurants, the food is absolutely delicious, the best are the green beans with mince and the aubergines just melts in your mouth. the menu is huge so you have to be precise of what you order. is a nice place to go with friends because then you manage to test all different dishes.",5
"experience to forget. disappointing: a long queue to go in, for having the typical dishes of low quality chinese restaurant. disgusting: one of the cooks, the line passed by the kitchen, went from touching bank notes, to make dumplings...",1
"excellent food, good service and a wide selection on the menu. the dumplings are a must! prices are reasonable given the location and filling in your menu selections wasn't too much of a hardship",4
love a dumpling  .light tasty  just delicious,5
i liked most of their dishes just the chilli chicken felt it was done a while ago and wasn't warm enough.would definitely go again.,4
"ate an early dinner this evening. excellent service. nice, friendly staff. the food was outstanding!  roasted duck, dan dan noodles and dumplings were all delicious. definitely would return and hope to do so.",5
"best chinese restaurant to go to for people of all ages, it has a large menu offering food catering to all needs",5
the dumplings are superb.,5
long queue but totally worth it. great selection and menu. the food is tasty and the price is reasonable,5
nice and authentic location but the dumplings are only borderline,3
delicious food so fresh and tasty and prices are very reasonable as well,5
was very disappointed with the food and service. we ordered and the food virtually came out straight away. the waiters seemed very disinterested in you. overall experience was poor,1
amazing dumplings made at the front of the shop as you watch. highly recommend the soup dumplings in particular. staff are pretty no nonsense which is fine. can get very busy but if you go outside peak lunch/ dinner times its no problem to get a table.,5
dumpling are pretty good although it's a small dumpling menu. tried several dishes and everything was amazing. had a great dining experience. one of the best i have tried in china town so far.,5
"my go to for chinese food, worth travelling and the queue. dumplings obviously 5 star.",5
"ordered so much food, but was so worth it. all dishes were fantastic. the dim sum was so fresh and can be seen being made. fab place.",5
avoid this place! staff were very rude and not welcoming at all!!dumplings in soup are dumplings in water. literally. weird. i will never come back there.,1
very good quality price balance. dumplings are a must. it gets quite busy after 7pm.,5
long wait to get in. my son loved the dim sum but i was disappointed with my chicken dish. not worth going back,3
"totally uninspiring.  if this is the best dumplings london has, then clearly london has not been to other parts of the world.",1
"awful. dumplings so dry like theyve been waiting there to be served, horrible service with attitude - because i asked for tap water.an overall terrible experience.",1
a great place for fresh dumplings. one of the best and cheapest in the west end. the service is beautifully no thrills.,5
pretty good dumplings for london. 8 per bamboo steamer but they're tiny dumplings. taste okay. nothing to rave about. but that's london for you.,4
"good service, the food is tasty & the restaurant smells so delicious. the dumplings could be filled a little more though. would definitely recommend if you are looking for chinese food.",4
"excellent chinese restaurant in london! some of the best chinese dishes i ever tried. the locale is welcoming and nice, although a bit small. does not accept reservations, which is a pro in my book, but i can see how it could be a problem for others.",5
"very good chinese restaurant. despite its name, i think the main dishes (like the tangy lemon chicken) are better than the dumplings. service is good and quick and the place is clean. they don't take bookings, so be ready to queue if you go for dinner.",4
very good dim sum for a reasonable price. they also serve a lot of other chinese dishes. just be prepared to wait for a table.,5
high quality food. but i feel like the michelin recommendation is a little much. it's great food but not worth going out of your way for.,5
"i agree with stephania who has left a review regarding the service. we ate here yesterday and the staff were incredibly rude, throwing the food across the table. they had no manners at all. it had a very bad smell too and very surprised at the michelin reviews. we will definitely not be eating here again.",1
very tasty dumplings! you have to wait in queue around 15 minutes but definetly worth it. also nice house wine.,5
excellence at it's best...,5
always reliably good. dumplings are homemade in front of you. xiao long bao to die for.,5
the fried udon noodles were good but the soup dumplings and fried dumplings were just ok.  the service was terrible.  the waiter never spoke one word every time we asked for something.,3
"while i thought the pan fried dumpling wrappers were a bit thick, the rest were wonderfully thin, all contained tasty morsels inside.",4
good food for a reasonable price.fast service yet you feel a bit unwelcome but its worth for the food.i would stay away from the wine glass its cute with water.,4
great place for dumplings (both fried and in soup) but other dishes are a bit average in my opinion.,4
"great food, well priced and friendly staff",5
food & drink: 7/10service: 6/10decor & atmosphere: 6/10service speed: 8/10cost: 8/10the best: fast service and good pricethe worst: long wait times and not the cleanest lowdown: the food is decent for china town and the service is good compared to most places in the area. dumplings are the way to go when ordering!,4
good dim sum in an authentic beijing vibe,4
great place for chinese food. i have tried many places in chinatown and this one always comes out on top. good prices too. try the dumplings.,5
"food is excellent, soup dumplings are fantastic, but they are reducing portion sizes each time i go",4
"good value food, big portions",4
a fabulous little restaurant in china town. alwats busy which is a testament to its meals.i would definitely recommend it.,4
great place. food is very good. staff friendly.and there ribs are great if you like ribs it's a must go.,5
fantastic food right in the heart of the west end.  well worth a visit.  get your chop stick skills up to scratch though ,5
"just the best dumplings ever!! wonderful service and even better food. love, love, love!!",5
very busy place and the service isn't particularly polite but damnnn... they's some tasty dumplings. food is great.,4
"excellent dumplings and a decent overall menu. worth the wait (there is normally a queue out the door). service is generally abrupt and efficient. on busy days you may need to remind or flag down, but the quality of food never varies regardless of how packed they are.",4
"a star for the location and atmosphere. i have no clue to why they have a michelin sticker. the personal is rude.the dumplings are chewy. when served in soup, the soup was just boiled water, no broth or anything.go to the thames southbank streetfood market, their dumplings are incomparably better.",1
"good food and dumplings. the quality of the food is high, but the staff could be more attentive. prices are reasonable.",4
great value and taste! staff were very busy but welcoming and courteous. food had great flavor and portions were good. really enjoyed the dumplings and dan dan noodles. will certainly visit again when in london.,5
well worth the wait! usually a line out the door and for good reason. food was great! service could be improved but they dont fake it at least.,4
"good dumplings and fish dim sum, other dishes seemed good but i didnt order.easy going place, very quick service and perfect for a pre theater dinner",4
"nice atmosphere, very quick service, piping hot  and delicious. waiter even told me i was ordering too much food & what to take off!  great, thanks!",4
"the pan fried dumplings were just incredible. i could have eaten about 10, they were so moreish! one of the best places in chinatown for food!",5
"absolutely delicious! i had the spicy pork dumplings, fried pork dumplings, kung po chicken and some chicken fried rice. everything was amazing. located right in the heart of chinatown, quick 5 minute walk from the piccadilly circus station.it is a very small place, so not many seats.",5
"an ok restaurant. food felt westernised and too sweet. the sitting area is cozy and the servers are polite.i dont think ill come again, though. the food isnt really impressive. if youre looking for good chinese food in chinatown, id recommend old town 97.",2
"to be honest, i couldn't see what the hype was about with this place. the queue was about 20 minutes to get in and the dumplings were not all that. we had other dishes but i just was not keen. maybe give it your own review (maybe i was missing something) but i would not go again",3
"works really well with icy weather outside and the warm wooden interior of restaurant, the dumplings in warm soup... almost perfect queue always crazy when i arrive it seems, though of the best  dumplings i have savored.",4
"i love this place. the dumplings are amazing. my family always eats here when we are in town. the first time we went we didn't like that the server was rude. but now we sit in his section everytime, his attitude is part of the experience. very entertaining .",5
dumpling relatively good and reasonably priced. dog friendly which is rare in london. will go back again.,4
always amazing tasting and quick to come out! best xiao long bao that ive ever had!,5
good handmade dumplings. long queue,4
"been 3 times now, great chinese restaurant",5
from now on my go to place for dumplings!!! long live beijing dumpling!!! they treat you really great!!!!,5
i had big hopes for this restaurant however the service from the waiter was very disappointing which made my experience not wanting to come back again. there are other dumpling restaurants with better service in chinatown incomparison to here.,1
"good food, cheap and in the middle of london, use to go there often while in my holiday in london.",4
"personally i found the food a bit lacking in flavor and texture overall, especially the steamed dumplings that i tried.",2
great food including dumplings- fire cracker chicken was excellent,4
good fine asian quidine.prices a bit extra and staff a bit cold,4
no queue for the first time ever! went for the famous dumplings. absolutely delicious! very friendly waitress. will be back (again),5
"superb food! well, you have to queue but its definitely worth it! try the firecracker chicken - delicious!",5
"line/queue up, order up, beer up and pig out.... xiaolongbao are as good as as it gets at this price point in london. no white table cloths here just fast service and check-box order sheets and cold beer. fast, cheap, easy. be sure to come slightly before tourist feeding times.",5
our favourite soup dumpling spot in london. if you like soup dumplings look no further. much better value for money than din tai fung london!,5
"fantastic food, i keep coming back for more! quick service too so if you have a short time before any appointment, youll have time to eat here",5
amazing chinese food! there is usually a queue but it moves fast! try the spicy pork baos and the crispy duck!,4
great tasting food for the cold winter months. the dumplings and chicken were great too!,5
"the best soup dumpling and handmade noodles i have had in london so far, highly recommend the place. you should make a reservation it gets really busy.",4
"fantastic service, food was really good. gets mad busy.",5
i find my chai here,5
nice teas at affordable prices,5
excellent doctors.,5
"competent chinese medicine, a nice place, and reasonable prices.",5
lovely service and great dessert,5
a popular place. yummy! worth the waiting.,5
good ice cream and waffle. long line but it moved fairly quickly.,5
"loved it, unique. but a bit pricey.",4
nice and interesting. tasty deserts.,5
"i just love this little place, shame its not a bigger shop with a coffee seating area.. these waffles are just delicious, love how you can have as many toppings as you like.",5
"this desert is one of a kind! whenever you happen to pop in china town, this is a have-to-go place.",5
"bubblewrapwaffle is an amazing little shop, it has great fast service. you can also watch the process as its made which is interesting. i definitely would recommend them.",5
the desserts are quite unique and this is what really led us here when we saw people walking around with the waffle looking conesthe queue was long. it took over 20 minutes to get our orderyou may however want to share this with a friend if you're not a fan  of that much sugar intake ,4
"my bubblewrap ice cream (regular waffle, matcha ice cream, white choc sauce and strawberries) was both delicious and pretty. the service was friendly and despite the line i didn't have to wait long.",5
"had the classic matcha & red bean & mochi flavour bubble wrap, apparently a great combo and i quite liked it except a little pricey. wished the queue was shorter lol.",4
i've had bubblewrap before but this one is simply the best!  the bubbles are light and crispy and they break away easily. delicious!,5
incredible food! definitely going again with friends,5
perfect location and totally loved the waffle with ice cream,5
best damn waffles has plant-based options ,5
really cool concept! great choices but crowded inside and no seating.,4
these are so good! ,5
great place for bubble waffle conveniently located in china town. vegan options available and matcha ice cream as well! my favourite is banana combo with dark chocolate give it a try!,4
crowdedoverpriced no special taste its a waffle with ice cream in itpickpockets there so be aware,2
"the waffles were very good, unfortunately they were out of most ice cream flavours when we arrived.",4
7 is expensive but its worth the experience at least once,5
beautiful and tasty dessert.very busy most times but it worthwhile the wait enjoy.,4
i had the matcha waffle with one scoop matcha ice cream and one scoop strawberry cheesecake and it was delicious ,5
"awesome waffle, nice ice cream and an amazing opportunity to step up your instagram game! totally worth the line thats always there...",5
i love it so light and yummy,5
"unique dessert on wardour street. as can be expected, queue is quite long. the space it very small. service is fast and friendly. the waffle choices are either template or create your own, which gives a lot of choices to customers. this is a good choice for dessert or quick summer bite. price is reasonable/ affordable.",5
arrive at store before closing time advertised on door and was turned away,1
$10 for takeaway icecream waffle and poor standard.different quality tof the product for different clients.,3
do not come here. they advertise closing at 10:30 but close at 10pm! and shut the door in my face,1
really love it! unfortunately there is no space to sit,5
"amazing desert, and quick service. worth the money",5
"different and very good desserts. the line is always long and out the door. it's a very very small space. if you don't want to wait in line, you can just have a look from the street window.the place smells super sweet from the bubble waffles being baked on site. the service is very kind and helpful. i recommend it!",5
my daughter enjoyed her bubblewrap. i didn't get much change out of a 10..,4
had the vanilla crunch which was amazing. love the idea and after a long walk in london you definitely need something like this. sweet and fun!,5
one of the best waffles i have ever had!!! if i'm in the area i would most certainly go again. @khana.guy,5
"light, crunchy. evenly delicious.highly recommended.",5
"so good, generous portion size and the staff are always lovely. love coming back again and again.",5
this is some serious desert. well worth it and definately highly recommended.,5
"i customised my own bubble wrap and combined strawberry mochi, sliced strawberries, along with the strawberry gelato and rose petal toppings  totally recommend this combo...if youre a fan of strawberries  its nice to stand near the waffle making machines when its cold outside ",5
great icecream with tasteful waffles,5
very tasty but slow service.,4
"finally jumping on the bandwagon and tried a bubblewrap waffle here. order pay and taste! everything goes very smoothly. it suits asian tasting bud very well, not super sweet. regardless, the waffle is quite expensive, perhaps a bit overpriced. you can usually have a proper restaurant dessert for the same price.",4
"we waited 15 mins on a sunny saturday afternoon, which is fine. the waffle was delicious, i got the one with strawberry and vanilla ice cream. it was gone quite quickly i gotta say: a bit more ice cream would have been great.",4
"great place to have a dessert in london, but the cafe is too small. the waffle is a signature menu here.",4
i wanted to visit bubblewrap for months and i've been following them on instagram for at least a year or two--it was completely worth the wait. one of the best desserts i've ever had. i'll be visiting again soon!,5
"a lot of waiting, tastes nice, fun to eat",4
such fun! delicous waffles with awesome combo ingredients,5
a novelty at best.,3
loved every bite. will def see you guys again.,5
very delicious ,5
"the bubble wrap was amazing there. i love it. in germany it was not so good as in london. so if i travel to london, i come back.",5
"central china town so expect queues and high prices. we were lucky and there was pretty much no one when we visited.the waffles are tasty and have a good selection of toppings.only downside is the price, which in my opinion, is high for what it is.",3
great place where to go when you love sweat. you can choose your favorite waffle.,5
"the line was unbelievable, but so was the food! i will say that waffle was worth waiting 50 minutes for...",5
just one word... amazing....!!!,5
good but not as good as the hype,4
i am still surprised how tasty it is.. wonderful,5
tasty! and very tasty!! ,5
keeps me coming back. i like the peanut butter one.,5
great place for a desert style meal very highly recommend this place for a visit if you are in london don't be fooled by nearby imitations,5
"waffle are great, however i went a bit crazy with the toppings, probably you only need 2 or 3. great service from the staff as well.",5
"nice friendly waffle/ice-cream shop.expect a 20 min wait during busy times.always a  good quality product served.very tasty deserts if your around china town,worth a vist!!",5
wow  good food means long queue .... they served fast. so it went well. especially the waffle was absolutely delicious.,5
delicious waffles and ice cream.,5
it was okay just to try it out. nothing to write home about. wouldn't go again to be honest.,3
must try it even you are on diet. lol.,5
7.49 is a lot to spend on a egg waffle. the waffle was a bit too crispy (and empty inside) so it just fell apart easily. gelato was good. presentation was also beautiful.,3
fantastic place for a delicious treat!,5
cool little place to get waffles and feel the positive vibes of one's of the most festive places i've been in london,4
the original and best bubblewrap waffle in london. nobody else comes close to their recipe or choice of combinations!,5
such a delicious treat! the best in soho!,5
"great blend of ice cream, toppings really pack a punch, peanut butter was lovely and surrounded by soft waffle. bliss! there is no seating inside and just a grab and go place.",5
yum. very good with allergens,5
"well, this is a must when you are in chinatown. it tastes just as good as it looks. be ready for stares and selfies while walking around with this ice-cream.",5
love you guys. i would love to see a cinnamon apple flavour out there one day. :),5
"i grew up with this traditional chinese sweet treat....but making it more exciting with ice cream and toppings. highly recommended. i opted for matcha ice cream, sliced strawberries and maltesers....very good indeed! definitely a treat but worth it!",5
"delicious! the cue moves very quick, and despite the line the staff are friendly and helpful! best bit. they have vegan options! only one premade vegan choice, but you can build your own which is awesome! expect to spend a minimum of 8",4
"yummy yummy. long queue but nice dessert, fresh bubblewrap. price between 7-9",5
"sooo good, you can pick so many different flavours and toppings and they're all so great, just be prepared for people to constantly ask where you got it from!!",5
a little bit of heaven in a bubblewrap waffle!!! highly recommend you give these guys a try!,5
"the most insane sensory journey in the ice cream world. once you have tried it you just want to go back. as it is a very popular spot, queues are massive so don't let this stop you. be patient and you will be rewarded.",5
tasty but pricey for what it is. 9 with all the toppings.,4
very good quality ice cream and the cone is so light and tasty.,5
"best bubble waffle in town! it's expensive, but it's worth it! also the service is always really quick despite the long queue. extremely recommended.",5
"great ice cream with egg waffles similar to those in hong kong. i liked that you could customise the toppings, and i chose nutella, hazelnuts and oreo to go with hazelnut ice cream",5
wow!! taste sensors exploding!! this place is amazing. so many different flavours and variety to enjoy. the freshness of the waffle is astound. straight from the grill into your hand.,5
"its an amazing experience.. if your a ice cream lover, an unique cone made of waffle ... and the rest it's just magicalkunio vlogs, honest review",5
"the bubble wrap waffle is amazing, you should visit if you like waffles",5
"wow, very tasty",5
best bubble waffles in the world! i had the vanilla icecream with strawberries and nutella.  it even beats those that you find in hong kong and asia.,5
absolutely delightful! such a fun and unique desert. plus it's yummy of course! i would highly recommend it!,5
"was good last year, unsure what happened but i wouldn't go there again.. waffle wasn't what it used to be..",2
great tasting waffles and ice cream combos,5
"such a delicious and positive experience, great bubblewrap waffle with a lot of vegan options! i was also surprised with the large portion sizes. i highly recommend this place :)",5
"very tasty ice cream!!you have option to choose your own combination or to take one of the recommended ones.we took vanilla base, strawberry cheese cake ice cream with a topping of condence milk and strawberry.",5
a great idea! waffle was nice and light and the toppings were delicious,5
very yummy! long line but went fast.,5
they should pay attention what we really want but i know they just want to sell this evening i asked for chocolate icecream and vanilla plus doble chocolate sauce and i get something that i wasn't expecting. i'm really disappointed,2
"tasted delicious, great customer service, good texture in the food, friendly staff",5
"my nieces place of choice for her birthday treat. it's a tiny shop, but full of temptation.  the freshly made waffles can be filled with your choice of ice cream,  fruits and syrups.  plenty to choose from.",3
"possibly the best bubble waffle shop i've been to! if i lived in london, i'd most likely go here every week!",5
quick serving. good selection,4
i'm in love with this store.  next time i will visit it again . i highly recommended!!,5
"we come here everytime we come to london, i can not recommend this place highly enough,friendly staff",5
"it was absolutely lush, so good, light n fluffy..defoe going back for more yummmmmyyyyyyy",5
pricey but very nice,4
"been here too many times to count. the lines can be a little long, but they move quick. double bae is my favourite at the moment. prices are a bit high, but well worth it and expected for this part of town. highly recommend for anyone who is a foodie or just loves desserts!",5
"great ice creams. i had tried more than a couple of time to have one, but for different reasons i wasnt able to. finally i had the opportunity and it was worth it. dont be afraid of the long line, you wouldnt regret the waiting time.",5
amazing waffles but the store is tiny and there's hardly any space to stand and wait for your order as it gets very busy.,4
heaven. long queue but worth the wait,5
three vegan ice cream flavours that were all yummy. the vegan peanut butter waffle base was delicious too. very substantial snack.,5
"friendly staff, who can help your choices.",4
loved it. and very lovely staff too.,5
very delicious! recommend to taste! :),5
"great place for a sweet treat, fantastic range of flavours and toppings, long queues and not cheap but well worth it.",4
bubblewrap pop delightful treat. will definitely return,5
if you don't mind paying a lot of money for a desert then the bubblewrap is for you (and all the tourists of chinatown). the bubblewraps themselves are made fresh but the ice cream is not that great - it's the style you'd get in a 100l tub from tesco.,3
very good place for dessert. lots of different mix and match options as can make your own combination. also have vegan options which is good as many ice cream places don't cater for this. can be quite a wait to be served and it's also quite a small and narrow shop so can be quite a squeeze.,5
"loved every bite! great concept, good quality ice cream...yummy toppings!",5
"who wouldnt love a fresh waffle hugging heavenly treats like oreos, kitkats, gelato, and nutella drizzle? yes, the line can be long, but its worth the wait.",4
"cant beat a bubble wrap, presentation and choice of flavours awesome. queues do get a bit long as very popular.",4
"it was very delicious! for a long time this was on my list to try! i shared this one with my hubby and it was still too much. the only thing was the price, its quite expensive.. but yeah its london.",4
"lovely! i ordered oreo up, and my friend tried the banana one and we both enjoyed it.",5
"great place to try bubble waffles! hot, fresh and delicious - staff are very friendly and have great bants with their customers. must try!",5
amazing bubblewrap waffles. i have tasted them in tokyo at tokyo tower and i can guarantee you these are better! also the stuff seems to be nice hardworking japanese teenagers.,5
great place if you like taking photos of your food for social media tricky to eat but very nice,4
"queue can get quite long, especially at busy times, but the bubble waffle is delicious. would recommend.",5
"""nut feast with matcha waffle"": the very flavorful matcha waffle is crusty on the outside but soft and melty in the middle; well matched with quality hazelnut gelato topped with a decent portion of hazelnuts - no cheating. will definitely return to try other flavors.",5
"ok, it's good, but not heavenly. i wish the waffle was warm.the waiting line is absurd, come early.",4
i like waffles and i like ice cream.....what more could i ask for in a venue !,4
top waffles 10/10 would recommend (already brought all my friends).,5
so yummy ,5
definitely you must try it if you visit london!the only thing is that probably you'll have to wait about half an hour because the place is quite small and there are a lot of people waiting outside.,4
product's are good and tasty but at the same time is a bit too exspensive for so little ice cream that u get.,4
"the bubbles are awesome, but i had ice cream on top, which kind of screws it. the area is very busy in the middle of china town, and there is no place to sit, just standing in the rain outside",4
"really tasty, and a good price (between 5-8) don't be put off by the queue, it moves quite fast!",5
you gotta go here. it's like a fun crepe with bubbles and amazing icecream!,5
"delicious bubble waffle - we tried vanilla crunchy one :). but it is quite expensive - 7,5",4
firs time i try a bubblewaffle.i ordered the oreo crunchy caramel cheesecake. the waffle itself was thin and delicious. i contained a ball of cheesecake icecream topped with caramel and 4 oreo cookies.just delicious.,5
a bit disappointing to be honest. not much better than an average stall you'd find anywhere and triple the price.,2
excellent waffles and quality ingredients.,5
"great bubble waffle, nice dessert to share",5
delicious waffles and beautiful presentation of food. definitely a must try in china town. don't let the long queues to scare you off.,5
lovely desert shop nothing more to say really,5
the pictures dont justify the taste! love it! i got the flavor that is the first on the menu! i loved it!,5
"well worth queuing up for, the queues can be out the door, when ever we goto chinatown we go here for dessert. amazing worth every penny.",5
so delicious hong kong waffle. definitely buy it again.,5
"so, so good! definitely recommend.",5
loved the bubble waffle cone but the ice cream itself was just standard ice cream and so you're definitely just paying for the novelty of a fluffy waffle cone than any of the ingredients. instagram worthy and hip and as such a long line no matter that it was a rather chilly day even by london standards. one time stop for me.,4
i loved it but the wrap could have been crispy.,4
"love this place, there is sometimes a queue out the door, but it is worth the wait! lovely to see an independent place thrive in an increasingly chain filled city!",5
my girl had one and loved it!!! ,5
very pretty waffles (instagram worthy) but not as tasty as i would have hoped.,3
it tasted as good as it looks. a must try.,5
"delicious, really big serving! lots of different flavours to choose from.",5
my happy place,5
amazing waffles! really friendly staff,5
everyone who loves sweat should try these bubble waffles,5
"the bubble waffles are so crunch, yet soft! delicious! very pricey for what it is, but hey: look how insta-worthy they are?",4
it was amazing.,5
"fantastic, and very crowded.",5
"decided to visit this as its a instagram place to go. we were lucky enough to get there 2-4-1 offer day, so worth the price. good waffles and delicious ice-cream.",4
amazing and delicious!,5
unique and tasty however rather expensive (5-6 pounds per dessert),5
"nice presentation, tasty gelato, friendly staff. was lucky enough not to queue for silly time. place itself is really tiny, can accommodate max ten people at once than you have to wait / queue outside.",4
if you want to have delicious waffli then this is your place..,5
"nothing fancy, mostly ice cream in a weird cone with some pieces of fruit; cute though, and good tourist attraction.",3
"nice waffles, but quite expensive for what they are. they look very pretty and the fillings are nice!",4
friendly staff and quick service despite the line.,5
"its a crazy queue and waffles of its kind! you cant miss it out. while youre indulging in it and someone calls you fat, eat them too!",5
amazing  please do the vegan one everyday ,5
"the icecream was delicious, i'd like a little more of strawberries but was delicious!",5
"not highly priced,  their bubble wrap waffle is so tasty",5
"lined up for 30 minutes.  they need to improve their work flow to service customers quicker.  the waffles with an air pocket was a nice gimmick and makes it lighter than it looks.  ice cream was just ok.  thought it was too expensive, even for london.  the waffle tasted fresh but was just ok.  this gimmick will wear off soon.",3
delicious waffles ,5
fun and really tasty!,5
would definitely give zero if i can. the egg waffle is soggy and the vanilla ice cream has a weird plastic taste..please dont waste your money and time on this,1
extremely busy and there's always a long queue but the waffle and ice cream tastes great.,4
waffles are really tasty but not sure if worth the wait,4
"great for a treat. the toppings are expensive considering the serving offered (it's trendy, and that's what you're paying for) but everything is fresh, and the dark chocolate ice-cream was delicious.there was a 15 minutes wait but the staff is incredibly fast.",5
"there is usually a long queue, but totally worth the wait. at least you have enough time to decide which amazing ice cream flavours and toppings you want and change your mind 3 times. the waffle is always freshly made and tastes amazing ",5
"not that great and way overpriced. the size of this dessert is huge. but they put one little scoop of gelato in a very big cone. the waffle bubble wrap cone was quite dry and tasteless but the gelato was good. its a tourist area, what do you expect.",2
something different that you need to taste. the ice cream was very good.,5
wow!!!!! today ive been in the shop for the first time and i tried the bubble wrap waffle  and it was delicious !!!! the one that i tried its called (deluxe love). to be honest i recommend this place to waffle lovers!!!,5
"absolutely delicious. we had to wait for a bit to get in (it was on a monday after lunch), but it was totally worth it. i had an original waffle with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and raspberries on top. and the other one was the same, but with fudge and caramel. they were amazing :) ",5
if you partner likes waffles and ice cream. then this place is for you.,5
"perfect place to have a dessert! great location, friendly staff and good service. bubblewrap very tasty, freshly made with different options of ice cream and toppings.",5
"very popular for good reason. fast service, lovely ice cream waffles with great selection.",5
what can i say. if you like sweet waffles then be prepared for a taste sensation.,5
such scrumptious flavours. i love that you can create your own and the fact that they had vegan options.,4
(++)                  ,4
"great space for a casual lunch. the cantonese style buns are very good, if a little expensive, especially if you have been to hong kong. lots of nice touches, in particular the design of the take away boxes",4
"perfection!!!!! as i see it, it's a must while in the area. you'll thank me later....",5
"great food, beautifully decorated and a wonderful atmosphere in the tea room downstairs. it's a very peaceful place to have a drink and reminiscent of an older time.",5
traditional chinese buns,2
"the taste of the bun is roughly average,  but the rice using in the rice box is far below average, not really recommended but still can have a try",3
"nice option for a little snack near leicester square. pretty tasty. small bao, prices a bit high for what you get. crowded and a bit chaotic during after work, pretheater.",3
came here for the custard bun. it was delicious! make sure to get extra napkins.,5
"bun and ox stripe were delicious, but the seatings are very cramped and not clean",3
delightful buns everywhere,5
"great dumplings, fair price. and don't miss the little chinese fresh pancake stall round the corner on the side street, also belonging to the same place.",5
"excellent, just a shame there isn't more seating for larger groups.",5
the place is very small and we had to wait around 15/20 minutes to sit down. later we ordered (the food is very quick to make) and we had to eat so fast because a lot of people were waiting to seat and they continued to ask us if we were finishing so they could reserve the table. that has been a bit upsetting.,3
very good bun with reasonable price - highly recommended,5
a bit slow service.,4
good buns! pork and lamb in particular ,4
good place for steamed buns. we had the custard bun which i loved. can't find these anywhere else,4
"its an interesting restaurant in soho, not like other chinese restaurants in china town. its small, and only serves steamed buns. highly recommend the lamb and curd buns. but the service is too slow in the morning.",4
"the best buns ever! the place has limited seating and pretty packed in the evening. we were lucky to get a seat and enjoy the soft buns! we tried the chicken, fish and veg buns - all came out great! a must try if you are in soho.",5
a place to try out various buns and traditional chinese food.,5
best custard buns.,5
"nice street food for hk buns and some of their authentic foods. good price for two, slightly small portion but you can always add one more side dish to cover. i also recommend their real restaurant based in basement of the same place. their fried rice is soso good.",5
"absolutely nice!!! tipical asiatic atmosphere, amazing, i saw that bun only in the japanese cartoon before and once tried you cant do without, they dont have to many seats, but the place is absolutely lovely, anyway they have a restaurant in the basement, so you have a large choose",4
great buns ,5
good food really great atmosphere,5
really tasty bao buns. succelent and lots of choice of flavours. vegetarian options available as well,4
bun house never disappoints ,5
"loved pig, and lamb bun, will go back to try again.",5
"amazing food, great beer, visit every time i have a chance",5
"love the interesting flavour combinations, especially the cumin lamb and the veg. sadly, they didn't have the red chocolate bun, which sounded interesting. the egg custard bun and glass noodles were good, too. relatively pricey for asian steamed buns, but worth it!",5
dont miss it,5
the best custard buns in london,5
delicious food and great atmosphere,5
both bun house and tea room are amazing. buns are exceptional and tea room is just like a bar from bladerunner.,5
"this restaurant is over rated.the veggie was too salted, chicken wing was too sweet, not tasted at all. clay port rice wasnt crispy. only the drink and the service is ok.not worth for the price.",1
"have the custard bun, dont have the fish bun",4
i can't stress on how you must go here for the best buns in town!,5
"go downstairs to check the beautiful tea room first if you're not going to get take away! especially if you like the film ""in the mood for love"" ;)",5
food was super yummy and staff were really friendly :) also the decor was so nice! would definitely recommend checking this place out. and the prices were very reasonable.,5
"delicious, soft, tasty buns. i tried all apart from the chocolate buns which were sold out. all were flavourful but my favourites were the pig bun and the fish bun. the tripe was amazing too. there is limited seating here so you should get takeaway. i will definitely return.",5
"great little place for steamed buns! they have a small selection, but each one is quality!  the custard buns are a must",4
"this quaint little place has amazing chinese buns. the three different types that we tried here were really good. i really liked the custard one.they have some beers on offer which are not your regular chinese beer (read: tsingtao), but offer something unique to the food.the food is quick and very affordable.",5
very tasty. the food is very nice and the atmosphere is beautiful.,5
"had the egg tarts and a custard bun. the custard bun was great, and the egg tarts were good but the pastry on the egg tart could have been better.",4
"if upstairs had no seats, go downstairs! they have a different menu and they are equally good. nice place to catch up with friends over yummy food. try the salty egg ice cream, they are surprisingly good!",5
"i love love love the custard buns. fast service, great food. unfortunately, its quite small. dont expect to be seated.",5
fast service. yummy buns. what more can one ask for! :),5
good and fast service food was alright,3
"lovely, reasonably priced  hong kong snacks. the chilli tripe is delicious as are all the buns. my daughter loves the chicken wings too. downstairs has really great decoration, a well stocked bar, and an interesting atmosphere.",4
"3rd time here, all i can say is yum! ",5
found this place by accident and came in to get some buns and really enjoyed everything from the service to the food. first voyage into cantonese cuisine. 5/5,5
"awesome buns, very good prices, i recommend the chicken one",5
moody place with an asian vibe. great buns for a reasonable price. don't hesitate to try a bun if you're around! tip: i preferred the fish one over the classic pork bun.,4
best salty egg yolk bao,5
the fish and pig were my favourite! my gf said the veggie one is great as well. ,4
"really nice , quick , clean and tasty ",5
the baos at bun house are amazing! i tried every bao on the menu and i would recommend the pig and the custard baos for sure. the iced teas were a disappointment though.,5
"one of the best bun places i have ever being in, i take my friends there all the time every time we go tourism near the chinese neighbourhood its a great place with plenty of bun variety and some intresting and original beers.",5
cheap and chirpy quick bite without pesky extras.wholesome food served steaming hot. brilliant in cold evenings.,5
"amazing buns! so tasty and so good! the best ones i have ever had! the place is also very authentic. great place, great food, great price!",5
lovely central spot for a hot steamed bun on the go. fish buns highly recommended,5
"fantastic ambiance, excellent food. would recommend",5
my first experience at a restaurant like this. it was quite unique and unexpected. i found it a little pricey but probably within range for the area.,4
simple but nice. like chicken liver bao. :xxx and soya milk,5
expensive and the drinks are disgusting,2
"best bun ever had! given the taste of the buns, paying around two pound for each bun is more than reasonable! moreover, each bun is pretty large and really satisfying. can't expect more from 2 pound!",5
very good place to go out with friends!,5
inexpensive and tastes great,5
very nice. the pork and lamb were nice. the chilli oil really upgrades it all.,4
food good.,5
great flavors but a bit pricey.,4
"stopped past here for a quick after theatre snack, was perfect and hit the spot!!!!!! great selection to choose from and the buns come in an awesome little box to take away!",5
"buns were tasty!! i like the pork one, as well as the custard one. the chilli tripe was so good too, if you like cow stomach and hot spicy food you should definitely give a try ;)",5
custard buns are best in london. also try the curried fish balls and the pork bao you'll not be disappointed,4
food in soho (especially on the go-ho (geddit?)) can be hit-and-miss. but bun house always delivers the goods. the dumplings are delicious. faces light up after the first bite. i suggest ordering the less conventional side-dishes: tripe and fish balls.,5
good food.  garlic basil wings and glass noodle salad really good.  fish bun and chicken bun great too,4
"the pork bun is delicious, the chicken could do with a more distinctive flavour. great for a quick lunch or pre-theatre bite. service can be a bit haphazard though.",4
nice food. quite dark but the food is amazing.,5
best buns in london,5
over price! only the dumpling was nice out of 8 items. small potion but not great taste. 12 half % service charge. ,3
loved the buns. we ate the veggie buns only and had the sour plum tea. yummy! kept coming back for more... ended up buying 8 buns for two people! the service was very perfunctory- could be a lot friendlier,5
chinese bapao. for me its like snack.,3
quick service and great food.,4
pig bun is delicious!,5
quick service and delicious buns!,5
piping hot melting salted egg custard buns are a must get! together with their sour plum juice. the tea room downstairs is swanky and takes you back to 70s hong kong! fantastic place to be!,5
very nice buns but expensive for the size :( 2.50 for one which is roughly the size of a cupcake instead of the muffin sized ones you can get round the corner.,3
nice buns very fluffy  and nice filling but that's it. the tea and the other food are just average very over priced for what you get...i did not go downstairs for the other menu so can't comment about that side otherwise the bun are  worth a try but i don't think i be back in the near future.........,4
beef rice was very tasty,5
"delicious buns. i would recommend the pork, lamb and custard buns and a chili tripe and fried cheung fan for the sides.minus two stars off as even though i like this place, the last time we were here it took them 30 mins to make the tripe and cheung fan. no apologies at all.",3
"tasty buns in reasonable price. the starters , fish balls and gloss noodles are very good as well. highly recommended",5
amazing restaurant with lovely outdoor seating! the staff are very pleasant and food is top notch! not to mention the price which is simply unbelievable considering the location and the food quality. they also serve imported drinks such as the soy milk from hong kong which i will recommend.,5
really nice loved it,5
"being so close to china town its hard to beat the meat bun options available a few minutes away.  however, the dessert buns were really good.  if you're passing by and in need of a sweet treat the custard bun and red chocolate bun are worth the money.next time though i think i'll try the tea room downstairs",3
"very quaint little spot. really enjoyed the food - nothing fancy but delicious. would recommend for a low-fuss, speedy meal.",5
"the male chinese server here is rude to asian or chinese customer in compares to caucasian ones, it feels targeted. dont come to this place if youre chinese, despite that it is an chinese restaurant, they rather have white customer lol",1
really special place. good vegi buns:),5
didn't get a chance to try everything as we had just ate downstairs at the tea room but the buns tasted good and the noodles looked  live.,5
"delicious bao place that you definitely need to try if youre a fan of bao buns. there are various flavors, my personal favorite was the pig bao! they also have other dishes worth trying - you wont regret it!",5
"cute little place in chinatown, amazing steamed shumai dumplings and beef bao!recommend",5
simple yet fragrant buns delivered quickly and to very high standards.,5
quick and easy and not bad for the price,4
quirky cocktails and food. very kind staff but takes a little while to get your drinks . fun themed night overall.,4
excellent! no line and great help from the ladies at the counter.,5
delicious buns and unusual cinese beers for a convenient price!,5
really cheap buns (2.50) and really fast service (5 mins or so). all options are really tasty but would strongly recommend the custard bun for dessert,5
"some of the best buns i've had in london were from here. they have a good selection and they also do takeaway which is a plus. the bao's are light, fluffy and not to stodgy and the filling are well flavoured and tasty!",4
"one of best bao zi (bun) in london. must-try : custard bun, pork bun. i tried mushroom (vegetables) bun yesterday, really good ! nice interior design, ambient. they got a crepe shop just behind the bun house, nice taste as well !",5
"great buns, the staff is not too smiley and helpful but its a nice stop on the way :)",4
the best baos in london,5
bun is not tasty nor authentic . those think the bun good might never tried real buns.,1
delicious and very cheap buns,5
"the chicken, lamb, beef and custard buns were incredible!",5
great place to eat. pork buns followed custard ones are the way to go!!! messy but deliciously rich and tasty.,5
really lovely food. if you want to know which bun is which the chinese symbols are at the bottom of your receipt.,4
"lovely service, relaxed and affordable. brilliant buns",5
"amazing! buns were okay, but would recommend getting the rice pots/small dishes. flavour was very good and decent price. definitely coming back to try other small dishes here.",5
"wow, spontaneously decided to pop in for a single bun and ended up ordering a plate. cozy and tasteful interior, chilled lo-fi tunes, friendly staff and absolutely fantastic food!",5
so good! love their veggie buns,5
good menu but not to vegetarians,3
really good service. the cashier this evening was really friendly and helpful!,5
great food!! highly recommend!,5
so good. food was excellent service was fast very cosy. i can't wait to go again,5
went to have a beer and was charged 5 for a small bottle and the beer was warm. when asked about a cold one i was told they didnt have any. would have preferred to have been told before they opened the bottle so i could have at least changed drink option.,2
great place for a quick feed! the place was buzzing when we got there and a few items on the menu had sold out so would recommend going early. loved the lamb bun and the custard bun was also an unexpected hit! will definitely be back!,4
delicious and fast. makes chinatown fast food much more accessible.,5
"coziest place ever to have yummy buns! everything we got was fantastic, and the upstairs room is sooo nice and cute.",5
"great place to stop for a quick bite. friendly, fresh and easy",5
"great range of well priced buns, restaurant inside has a nice interior as well. lots of sides as well which can be ordered alongside the buns",5
good but not incredible. better buns in other restaurants in the same area,3
"food is very good tastes ""real"" - just a lot smaller than my expectation (especially the beef brisket rice)",4
"beautiful. they sell quick individual delicious buns for 2.5. i loved the veggie one but i wanted so many more. they don't have a bundle price where you can buy lots of buns for a cheaper price. other than that, all good.",4
the glass noodles is too good!,5
so good i went back for seconds.,5
"so amazing - just go. cheap, delicious, moorish, authentic. not in the centre of china town but worth the extra couple of minutes walking.",5
super tasty and affordable buns! i especially loved the pork and christmas buns.,5
"love the yasai bao, pickled cucumbers and quick service!",5
shumai is awesome! cooked fresh,5
very cozy place. the bao was great and not too expensive,5
ok place to eat. nothing special.,3
2 buns and 1 beer cost 8.8 pounds. good! better than beijing dumpling next door.,4
"casa de baos e comida chinesa, o ambiente  muito bom e a comida  espetacular, pedimos o menu de baos que inclui dois baos  escolha e uma cerveja chinesa do dia, pesos tambm um prato de tripas que so maravilhosas e outro de arroz e carne.a cerveja  boa e o lugar  bastante concorrido.  pr pagamento.",5
"tasty and cheap cantonese steamed buns. definitely recommend the custard buns, they are absolutely delicious.",5
really tasty food and instant bao buns as you order. i'll definitly be back,5
good buns for cash strapped hungry people. only take credit cards!,4
the quality of the dishes we ordered were more like a takeaway than a restaurant. i guess it was our first and last visit to this place.,3
very authentic,4
soooooo damned goodthanks!,5
great selection of top buns,5
that custard bun......,5
"quick, simple and tasty.",5
what a taste on such a small piece of steam bun!,5
"this place is delicious. i've only gotten take away. the chicken rice pot is to die for, and so are the garlic cucumbers. easy on the wallet too. main guy working take away is also always friendly.",5
"buns are great, presentation is good and a very lovely atmosphere with an american style vibe. prices are not too bad, but eating on street would be cheaper and just as nice. here you pay for the experience.",5
wooden furniture giving the place an authentic asian look. great spicy noodles and great bao.,4
"this shop actually exceeded my expectations in terms of taste! the curry fish balls and the smashed cucumbers (pretty spicy though) were excellent! the buns themselves were alright, and all in all it was good value in my opinion for the price you pay.",4
"affordable, nice location i go there when i want to try something new and nice",5
good place for a quick snack. buns were fluffy but the ones with meat didn't have as much filling as i wanted. the egg yolk one was the best though. super messy and delicious.  milk tea was really pricey for just a small cup. but it did taste nice. overall good enough if you were in the area and wanted a snack etc.,3
"excellent and authentic food, tried all of the dim sum and the flavours and quality was on point. definitely would come back again.",5
"recommended! they do absolutely fantastic custard bun, must try, the custard filling will flow out when you take a bite! their shrimp dumpling is also very tasty!",5
"excellent.  just what i needed, a little hungover and this hit the spot.  the lamb belly in particular was excellent. though i think i would struggle to eat more than two.  will be back.  to try the other items on the menumore seats upstairs. no cash accepted, card only.  2.5-6 a dish. 5 for a beer",5
nice little place. the custard bun is nice. the wings are crispy. definitely want to come back to try more buns.,5
"the food is really good, especially the buns. the setting is also really nice, but very dirty which made me uncomfortable. the tables and dishes are well kept, but a better cleaning of the seatings should be made. the service is good though!",3
"simply, and consistently, the best bao buns in town. i have a preference for their tripe as well, it's delicious, but the rest of the menu is full of great choices, you can't go wrong with this establishment.kudos to the team as well, no matter how busy it gets they're always cheerful and very polite.",5
so damn tasty! will be back,5
easy on the menu and easy on the wallet. good amount of choices with comfy happy service. it can get a bit busy at times but it's worth a wait if you must. a bit touristy yet good reliable choice.,5
great interior and good quality buns.,5
"had to wait over half an hour with no other customers in. ordered beef with rice, beef was too greasy and too tough to chew on, rice was overcoocked. bad experience, never again",1
nice steamed buns and fish curry balls. quickly served and reasonably priced at 2.50 a bun. need 3 for lunch. very casual. would be 4* but its a bit lifeless and squashed,3
awesome thick fried noodles with amazing spices .. best i ever had. matched with a really tasty rice wine!,5
"flavours (except the winter special mulled wine) were good and good for quick eat. probably because it was breezy restaurant, the buns came out little cold though. curried fish balls were cooked well and may be my favourite.",3
"i had there just one dish, i think pork dim sam in soup which was good and descent price. there is always a queue there so i can imagine the other dishes are good as well.",5
"bao addiction is a disease. here, the pig bao transports you through seven levels of umami and the duck egg yolk 'custard' bun basically comes from another dimension. my counsellor will be sending you the bill forthwith.",5
"sooo good! so much flavour, buns are wonderfully fluffy and excellent vibe. ho fun is a must try.",5
"the pork and veggie were delicious. so was the cucumber salad.the chicken bun was a bit dissapointing (it has liver in it). also, the beer was warm...",4
"really cheap, lovely food and a great location.",5
the buns were lovely and the music and decor made me nolstagic! the only thing is that i found the ordering and picking up process slightly chaotic during busy hours.,4
lamb and mustard bun tastes great! typical cantonese type of buns and not the same as the way northern china cook buns ,4
food is absolutely incredible and really good value for money! service is fast and friendly! i always make sure i drop in if i'm nearby even if i'm not hungry!,5
"great value, great food!",5
"this is amazing. it was my first time trying asian buns, and omg i love it. we tried pork, chicken and veggies (this one is the best) and the noodle salad . the place is quite small, but perfect for a quick bite. and the prices are okay. i will definitely will go back. can't wait",5
"perfectly cooked steam buns for only 2.50. good selection of fillings with the lamb and fish being highlights. quick service with options to eat in, albeit with not much space, or to takeaway.",5
never disappointed! hole in the wall but love this place and all it has to offer.,5
"fantastic! the buns here are delicious - we always come here whenever we're in london. all the bun options are amazing, watch out for the custard one though, it is quite explodey, in a delicious custardy sort of way.",5
stumbled across this place on a day out in china town. amazing value for such high quality dishes! id recommend the chicken bao and scallion chicken rice pot.,5
fluffy steamed buns come cantonese-style at this quick cafe with a late-night drinking den.,5
small menu with authentic looking tasty buns with excellent fillings. my favorite is the pig bun. also have drinks and salad available. service is friendly and quick,5
"great choice of fillings, freshly made buns. really tasty and not expensive for the area. perfect snack if youre heading to the theatre afterwards. the buns are only served upstairs - very quick service but not that many tables inside.",5
the pork brisket was good but servings are small for the price. the steam buns are also on the small side. we thought it was just a pay and lock up but one of our buns took almost 30 minutes.,3
this place is great! best buns in london,5
simply tasty!! 2.50 for those tasty buns is such a bargain!! the fillings are nicely spiced and the bun is just so fluffy,5
"food and environment are good. everything served like take away, paper bag, disposable bowl, order and collect by yourself. staff really really impolite and impatient.",2
"buns and garlic chicken wings tasted good, especially beef bun. caf is like self-service (you come, order and pick up your order) and it has 6 small tables.",5
"early dinner, simple, good and quick. had three dumplings (pork 2x + vegetables) as well as excellent cow tripes with black bean and coriander - which is enough. it is a very simple place - more of a (good) snack",4
"offering a wide selection of fresh steamed buns replenished often throughout the day. three ought to do the trick for most, enjoy with a special beer and don't forget about the absolutely amazing house made chilli oil (be warned its quite spicy).",5
cool little place off the main street. maybe a little pricey but food was very tasty and very fresh. had the pork bao and the rice noodle rolls (a first for me) - cheung fun. choose and order at the front desk; collect when ready from the back bar. good lunch stop.,4
sadly don't take cash. the taste was good,4
very tasty. always drop by when i'm in the area for the pork bun. the salted egg and custard is tasty too.,5
"the custard in their custard buns tastes amazing, just wish there was more of it.",4
i really enjoyed the custard buns and wok fried cheung fun. staff could be more friendly.,3
"the bao bun was super fluffy, sweet and delicious. probably the best bao bun ive ever had. it was there perfect comfort food for the cold weather. would 100% go back. defo recommend !!",5
really good dim sum here. my favourite is the runny custard bun which is hard to find in the uk. they also do a variety of other chinese dim sum which is all freshly made and tasty.,5
"delicious buns, cucumber and great curried fish balls. eat in the very pretty tiled room or take out.only thing we were less into was the salted soda - it was diet. tea probably a better bet.",5
"lovely street food to have around chinatown. came once and was pretty satisfied. as a fellow chinese person, i would advice ordering the pork meat one as its usually the best in buns!",5
"delicious, fast and good value for money. staff were also friendly and the atmosphere was very cosy and nice",5
the buns are one of the best ones i've had around chinatown. bun house has a pretty nice selection of buns as well. i highly recommend this place for a quick bite or takeaway. their custard bun makes for a great dessert after all their other options.,5
"go here. get the custard bun. it is worth all the hype. some people say it's expensive, but i got 3 buns (pork lamb and custard, all amazing - the lamb a little spicy and with a lovely base note of cumin) for 7.50 and was full.",5
"best buns i've ever had. fresh, fluffy, and seemingly all hand made from scratch. side dishes like noodles are also very flavourful. friendly and fast staff.",5
amazing buns! great for quick service,5
"very cute place! portions are small so need to order at least a few things for a meal. otherwise, great for a snack. the buns were great.",4
the food was delicious and good value for money.,5
decent buns and good selection of quick snacks. take card payments which is rare in chinatown.,5
amazing find in heart of china town slighlty tucked out of sight. reasonable prices and great beer selection. i go here solely for their custard buns alone. delicious.,5
nice place for casual chinatown dumplings and tasty sides away from sometimes chaotic restaurants on main strip.,4
love the custard (lau sa) buns!,5
fantastic buns and even better smashed cucumbers and rolled rice noodles. nice beers to go with.,5
"really nice bun, large choice and typical drinks also available.too bad that the seating is a bit random.",4
great food and good prices. staff are very friendly also,5
wow! the buns were amazing! we came back for them for several time while we stayed in london.,5
good food and cool atmosphere upstairs,4
"a small place making chinese steamed buns. they are tasty, albeit smallish at 2.50. we had the lamb, pork, vegetable, custard, beef and fish buns. all were good. the custard one is made with salted duck eggs, but tastes like normal custard more or less.",4
small and quirky. very tasty buns,4
"very good food, non ernational service",4
my favourite place to go of all time,5
"good food, fast and cheap. load up on buns in a matter of minutes. the chilli rice pot was way too much for my weak spice tolerance.",4
"good prices, very clean and pretty spacious with a chilled environment (1920s-ish) and delicious mantou as well, definitely recommended",5
"not much more to say than, absolutely stunning bao buns! the buns here are better than any we were able to find whilst visiting china last year.the place itself is a bit scruffy but feels very authentic. a great place to stop off for lunch or just a snack.",4
"really nice buns in london. love it! the pork, the beef, the salty egg custard one is lovely!",5
amazing buns and always friendly staff. one with custard is a must to try.,5
waited for 20mins to get my two side dishes. no apologies at all. the taiwanese staff (perhaps a manager) is extremely rude.,1
love this place ! very casual joint,5
"whole lot of fun. second but to none. pick your fillings and your style, then your wait will be worthwhile.",5
"nice little place for a quick lunch or snack, good friendly service in chinatown and food is lovely too ",4
seriously mediocre buns & dishes. would suggest trying other more authentic restaurants in chinatown,2
the custard bun was fantastic. really tasty filling. i also really enjoyed the pork bun.,5
"oh yeah, the staff are nice, try a custard bun, eat whilst hot",4
lovely buns! the duck egg custard is ,5
always delicious at a great price!,5
"went to eat here with a malaysian friend, they were impressed. really tasty authentic malaysian food. staff were friendly, efficient and portions were good",5
good food at reasonable prices,4
"big selection of food, decent portion and good value for money.",5
"laksa is incredible, go now...",5
"very poor. beef rendang was microwaved, food was hot on the outside and cold in the inside - how old was this beef rendang?  neither was it good value at 10 for 4 small peices of beef.  rest of the food was mediocre, surprisingly for its location in central london.   better malaysian food elsewhere.",1
there may be a wait and a line ride at popular times but it is worth it. the food is delicious. good singapore laksa and the nasi gorang also yummy. yes it is busy and yes expect that your dishes may not all come out at the same time but that's part of it and the focus is on the food.,5
always yummy and bustling.,5
"reasonable price and very delicious malaysian food. the shop is in chinatown but in a small quite corner, away from all the noisy tourists. ",4
sadly the laksa was flavourless and bland. will not come back which is a shame as the service was fine.,1
small place but full of customers for a late weekday lunch when i arrived. the singaporean laksa came in a huge bowl and was delicious!,5
"amazing malaysian food, really quick service. a good mix of dishes, for really reasonable prices. tucked down an ally so less touristy than as lot of places nearby in chinatown.",5
food generally tasty. beef randang really tough. very bad service.,2
"good food and decent prices! service is very good too, orders come pretty fast! very friendly waitresses as well!",4
"hidden on one of the side street in chinatown, food taste amazing. definitely authentic malaysian food.",5
"authentic malaysian food in the heart of london! excellent nasi goreng, just the right level of spice and crunch. ambience is basic which is good because it doesnt take away your attention from the delicious food and efficient service. is a hidden gem ",5
nice oriental food.,4
great malaysia food in london. satisfied my gf craving. large portion,5
lovely in a small quiet corner of china town,5
"amazing food for the price! the service was excellent, everytime i needed someone, they were not hard to find and they were very kind and happy to fulfill what i asked. the price is also great considering the great food you get.",5
"love this place, would definitely come back food it great it can get very busy at times but worth the wait.",4
"casual and friendly ambience, never a let down. foods always tasty and served quickly. offering southeast asian cuisine favourites.",5
"the best lapsa in town, awesome food, excellent service, claire was fantastic!!",5
this restaurant serves the best singaporean laksa in the city.,4
the best singapore laksa in london ,5
a good place to enjoy malaysian food. a bit disappointed my hainanese chicken rice was dry and the rice not too flavoursome. the laksa was much better with a richer sauce,4
"been going to this place for years now. as a malaysian, other than roti king and gopals corner, this is the place to get your malaysian hawker style food fix!",5
good malaysian dishes,4
best in town. not keen one one dish ( first time in c&r) kind enough to give me a 2nd dish choice on the house....which was delicious ,4
food was greasy and discovered after my visit the restaurant only has a 1 out 5 hygiene rating!,1
well priced and tasty,4
"i had the hainanese chicken with rice but there was almost no flavour with the chicken and the chili sauce tasted odd. although the plum and lime drink tasted really good! (only order it if you like sour drinks though). an ok experience overall, but i guess the price wasnt bad for what you get.",3
good malaysian at very reasonable prices. looking forward to going back and trying more of what they have to offer. i had a short wait for a table but not long. seems to be a popular dinner spot.,4
clean and good value for money,4
"i've never been disappointed, very good quality food at a very low price. suggested!",5
"as authentic as malaysian gets in london! always enjoy the singaporean laksa, the beef rendang, and the wat tan ho.",5
delicious. spicy.....,5
love food here!!! one of my favourite place in london!!,5
fantastic value cheap and cheerful food.,5
"good malaysian food, but service is not great",4
"great malaysian restaurant. has most dishes you'd expect from malaysia. laksa, nasi lemak, roti canai. and beverages to suit, milo ais, teh tarik etc. worth the visit.",4
the food and service was great and the fresh mixed fruit juice was devine i could have drink 2 glasses easily. this is one of favourite eateries. the only complain i have is the place was cold upstairs where we set.,4
"nice food, would probably visit again if im nearby. however staff were quite eager to clear the tables. wouldnt recommend getting the chicken wings; they were crispy but had no taste, they also cost 6 for tiny nibblets!",4
one my favourite authentic malaysian restaurants.reasonable prices with great service.15 years later still going back once a week,5
best singaporean laksa! been coming here for the last 10 years and always bring new friends recommending the place.,5
nasi goreng mamak here is the best in town!,5
little choice of vegetarian food. the dishes we ordered were ok-ish. the tofu smelled and tasted kind of like chicken.would not come back here.,2
"excellent and authentic malaysian flavours for an affordable price. mee goreng, nasi goreng, penang prawn mee are all delicious and really really hit the spot when you need some good asian dishes to feed the soul!",5
"a delightful, authentic place with delicious food. i ordered a malaysian-style nasi goreng, which was amazing. we ordered some starters to share, which disappeared fast. definitely recommend.",5
"crc is hidden down an alleyway in soho china town uk. close to the new gates. i was pleasantly surprised by them, the food and service were great. if you're with a big group they can move their tables around to accommodate you.",4
"though it was a little difficult to find, it is very much worth the visit. the chicken and beef is halal here. the service was prompt, the wait staff friendly and engaging. the venue is well lit and spaced out nicely for the small space. the cafe has a nice and relaxed atmosphere too.",5
malaysian restaurant in a little alleyway in chinatown. make sure you turn up with your whole group as they wont seat you. noodle soup dishes are huge!  made the mistake of ordering satay as well which was far too much. tasty.,4
"we had a malaysian and singapore laksa, they were good, wont return for them though",3
great food but the waiter on the first floor was rude. not an issue since i wont be back here again.,3
good food. good service,5
amazing food and great service! i had thai food in a malaysian restaurant but was awesome!?,5
the best a hungry malaysian can do when you're far from home!,5
amazing food. quite busy so we got there at 6pm and got a table fine.,5
nassi lemak is the best!,4
great food but poor service,4
"great laksa. quick service, reasonable prices.",5
food mediocre,3
malaysian/chinese caff. good food and the staff seem to enjoy their job.,4
"i had the roti and sauce followed by the singapore laksa and was genuinely blown away by the quality of the food. tremendous value and i'm still thinking about that laksa 5 days later!  will be back multiple times, no doubt.",5
decent malaysian food.,4
"we ordered ala carte, asam pedas fish, beef rendang, prawn sambal and kalian. we like most of the dishes, but beef rendang was not as we expected, still good though. wonderful service and friendly staff.",5
best value singaporean food you'll find in the area.,5
"my food was tasty and the service was good, but my entree came out cold. had to pay extra for rice. prices were okay.",4
simple fresh fast malaysian food with a very authentic feel tucked down a side street in soho. definitely recommend and go for the laksa if you like something with a punch.,5
quite busy - good value - food could be better - visited by lots of locals - so maybe we chose the wrong things from the menu,2
nice malaysian or singapore restaurant.,4
"food was alright, it was nice but not life changing. service was poor (but kind of expected). prices are a bit steep for what you get but i suppose it's in chinatown. the menu photos on google are deceiving and must be from a while ago as the noodle soups are now 9-10 rather than 7-8.",3
"lamb curry, always a good choice",4
yes! don't tell anyone about this place if you have been there! it's mine!,5
my favourite place to eat. malaysian food. yummy everytime.,5
poor food. ordered the chicken it was mainly bone. waitress unaware of allergens (ie: what was gluten/dairy). disappointing as malaysian is usually one of my favourites.,2
"a little gem hidden near chinatown. great food, fast service",5
"i felt they are not as good as 2 years ago... please ask staff for chopped green pepper, it's one of the sauce/spice they offered for customers, that's the most amazing thing. add some into your food then upgrade to another level. the staff that serve us  is quite rude, that's another reason i only gave 3 stars.",3
awful customer service!! extremely rude waitress who overcharged us and told us to eat faster so other customers could come in. we had only been there 25 minutes. wont be back.,1
decent place for laksa in london. service is very quick and efficient.,4
yummy and affordable. quite enjoy the plum lime drink...minus the paper straws,4
great food and price.  we have been going here for over 15 years,5
the venue is well lit and spaced out nicely for the small space.,4
off track but well worth a visit. try the salads especially the thai one with papaya. good food and reasonable prices,5
"very nice place, they could serve half portion for half price. is worth it to go",4
authentic malaysian foodhad the hokkien mee (noodles) which was exactly as one would get in malaysia - absolutely delicious!the chicken satay sadly is not as good - seems fried (not charcoal grilled) and the peanut sauce is not that great - still very good.,5
great malaysian cuisine at very reasonable prices. it's not a place where you spend a lot of time. just eat and go but the food is good.,4
superb. the singapore curry laksa is amongst the best you'll find london. the rendaang is another must try too.love this place.,5
most malaysian style cooking. good selection of dishes but nothing exciting.good service.,3
great food. fast service. not quite enough seating though. but the wait is worth it!,4
"fantastic little restaurant. the food was superb and the service was slick. the prices were extremely reasonable. it's easy to see why people are queuing to get in. food wise, we had the singapore laksa, very creamy and spicy. to drink i went for bubble tea with tapioca pearls.this place is a real gem and a new favourite.",4
cheap and cheerful gem! tasty food at a good price. sometimes a bit cramped but this isn't a big issue.,4
"carb heavy,  spicy and fragant and at times squishy food, enjoyable!",4
don't miss this place if u like malaysia food. it just taste like home - must come,5
"nice, but found it to be more quantity over quality.",3
"delicious laksa, quick serve & great ambiance.however we  waited for 30 minutes to get a table.",4
great malaysian food at reasonable prices. great value for money. large selection on the menu.,4
"fast service in a modern surrounding, definitely one of the best places i've visited in the soho area. singapore laksa was fantastic. i would recommend researching what you'd like for lunch prior to your visit - so you know what you're expecting if you're fresh to this cuisine!",5
great value restaurant in the heart of chinatown. make sure you get the barley drink!,5
friendly staffs and delicious seafood tomyam yummy ,4
good food but not friendly service. it is a shame because the food is very good. it is okay to smile to a customer.... the food comes very quickly so it is not a place to spend time in. it is a quick in and out.,3
"stunning food served with a smile ,great value for money",5
"a delightful restaurant, the fish balls in the singapore laksa were delicious",5
"hidden down this side street in london's chinatown, c&r is my go to for hainanese chicken rice in the uk! it hasn't failed me yet! just a heads up - they won't seat you until your entire group has arrived!",5
great food and service. will be back to try some more dishes from the huge menu,5
food is good but getting expensive,4
malaysian halal diner in soho. prosquick servicemassive portions one of very few halal food places in sohoflavoursome foodconsbusy at timesmistake with our orderseating with other people at busy times,4
it was authentic and great! all nicely familiar dishes,5
"top notch food and drink, enjoyed with two malaysians who where missing their nasi.. fast service, reasonable prices, centre of london. perhaps not the best place for a long romantic evening meal.",4
"good service, be prepared for a queue. char quay teow was really nice. liked the rojak (mixture of fried tofu and veg in a sauce), fried chicken wings and the teh tarik.  did not like the satay or the roti chanai  but that's me, comparing with the authentic taste i am use too.",3
comfort food that i would recommend to any south east asian whos in london.,5
love it here. good prices and very authentic food .,5
one of the best malaysian restaurants in london!,5
the fried rice and char kwe tiaw are the best,5
the food is amazing! so much to choose from on the menu so brace yourself. it's now my favourite place to eat and the service is on point! even when there's a line outside they really arr so attentive to you making sure you get seated as quickly as possible. they close around 11pm. ,5
always love the food here. very tasty and also at affordable prices! great service from the staff member,5
great restaurant,5
"authentic food in a calm vibe, clean and tidy would come every week.",4
yummy. must go if u miss malaysian food,5
"cheap, delicious and v quick service. would definitely visit again.",5
best malaysian i had in london so far...,5
awesome and delicious food and good service. they have a big variety of dishes from which you can choose what suits you most.i don't eat spicy food at all and it is one of the few places that i can safely order and not return due to the food being spicy.,5
great authentic malaysian food!! really quick and affordable. i loved the tom yum seafood noodle soup and the laksa is also great.,4
lovely cozy place. good service and excellent food. recommended by my malaysian friend.,4
"top food, no frills, amazing value. bang on!",5
excellent food not bad price for central london. this is a place to eat good food then leave not a place for ambiance or sitting chatting and does not pretend to be anything else.,5
truly fantastic laksa. the stuff dreams are made of. the restaurant itself is basic but the service is quick.,4
"hidden gem. very fast service, sizeable portions of good food - feels genuine and home made.",5
"best affordable maly place in london, visit regularly, good lasak",5
"food ordinary. chicken satay was burnt and tough, seemed like old re-grilled chicken, would not order this again.",2
the food is amazing,5
"food is great with good portion. would definitely recommend to anyone who craves asian food back home or , anyone who wants to try the best authentic asian meal.",4
pretty good malaysian and chinese food at a decent price. slightly uncomfortable seating. the venue of this place is not obvious as it is hidden in an alley,5
"the singapore laksa noodle soup was rich in flavour, definitely one of the best in town. kampung style nasi goreng was okay, slightly too oily to my taste. overall taste of food was good with mediocre service quality.",4
our favourite place in london for consistently fresh and high quality authentic malaysian food. very kind and friendly staff. great prices and always a pleasure to eat here.highly recommended.,5
great noodles,5
"dreadful service. the food is authentic and the menu has a lot of dishes you cant find elsewhere. but the service is just awful, even for chinatown. i ordered a roti canai that never came. i had to ask several times to get drinks. go elsewhere, the food is not good enough to make up for the dire service.",1
"echo some of the other reviews - the portion sizes have shrunk tremendously, and the service is totally apathetic. go to rasa sayang instead.",1
have been a customer of them for man many years. food is always great and consistant. huge amount of choices as well.,5
"the standard has gone done. food not all that authentic. lots of customers. staff not very interested when given feed back that the vegetable dish that we ordered was full of the stalks part of the veg hence not very nice and, it was hard and not easy to eat. disappointed.",2
food here is delicious!,5
delicious singapore-malaysian food with tasty ingredients. they have the spread of sambals and chili padis which is really key and prices are moderate here. staff are very helpful and available.,5
super roti canai,5
"big portion with reasonable price, fast service.",4
excellent singapore laksa,4
quick friendly service with good food in big portions. great little hidden away option for great malaysian food.,4
"4 for a 330ml bottle of lager? that hurt. vegatable spring rolls were from a packet and appeared to contain almost no vegetables. my beef rendang was a large portion and had excellent flavour, but wasn't served hot enough and had clearly just been microwaved as the beef had dried out.",2
best singapore laksa in london by a country mile.  but don't tell anyone or you'll ruin it for me.,5
"outstanding food, no reservations necessary but you may have to wait for a table. nice cheap and cheerful dinner",5
good place to come for fairly authentic malaysian dishes. very large portions and a reasonable price.,4
good but when we went they were out of beef and lamb,3

great friendly service and dishes where yummy; definitely go back n try the other options too..,5
dreadful staff and terrible terrible service. really not recommended! we went there in a group and the old man was not friendly at all especially when it comes to payment.  never experienced something like this before! we will never come back just because of the horrible service.,1
great malaysian food and reasonably priced favourite place.,5
avoid at all costs. got food poisoning. very rude staff.,1
the dishes are quite large although pricing isn't the most budget-friendly. dishes are kind of expensive for what it is. bf got charged 3 for rice that wasn't made clear that it didn't come with the dish - kind of a scam.,3
i can vouch for the laksa - under a tenner with a cup of jasmine tea - but i had some serious food envy when checking out what the other (mostly malay) diners we tucking into. looks like a menu well worth exploring...,4
"great service as always , very authentic malaysia food and delicious",5
the taste of malaysian food here is really authentic,5
"i love this place, big portions to share and reasonable price...nice hangout place...",4
good food and fast service. exactly what is needed at this kind of place.,5
delicious malaysian food i approve! the service very fast. the place always full ,5

good food but definitely not something to remember. service could improve a lot.,3
i tried:1) laksa2) char kway teow(fried flat noodle)3) teo chew fried vermicelli.4) mee hoon kwayin my opinion. all tasted good. i especially like teo chew fried vermicelli. huge/generous portions. i must say the food tasted very authentic.,5
"great malaysian and singaporean food. c &r is one of the beat malay and singaporean places in london. the price is good and the food tastes nice. their nasi lemak is rather nice. some colleagues recommend the laksa. other colleagues say that the hainanese chicken rice is best had elsewhere. overall, very nice place.",5
good food at a great price. not sure about the hygiene!,4
"for 15 plus years it's a staple on a visit to london. this place is a reason to come to london on its own. a great menu, great staff and recently refurbished it's even more awesome.",5
the food has flavour at the top excellent moments,5
"great meal with friendly, welcoming staff. big filling healthy portions at good prices. and a nice atmosphere!",5
best malaysian food i've had outside malaysia and great value too.,5
"nasi goreng kampong was lacking shrimp paste  . i was missing this dish and the one there was alright but it just wasn't the same, you know?",3
"decent food, reasonable price. big serving sizes.",4
"the penang laksa is really good! sour, spicy and full of taste! i recommend also roti chanai and fish balls as starters!",5
"service a little slow...food flavors, good...interesting dishes....rendang good but i make it better at home....i might be just used to my cooking ...we went at 3pm and by the time we left there was already a line of 10 people waiting outside.popular place i guess",4
"went for the roti canai, not many places do that. was nice.",4
great malaysian food in the heart of london. but pricing is catching up quickly. still love the taste,4
"you have to try the pork belly, it was amazing!",5
"i would give it 6 stars if i could. the problem with this restaurant is that its too awesome, all the food is delicious and cheap. service is great. i cannot recommended this place enough.",5
the laksa is a dream...,5
"this place is small and the food is not authentic malay. also, it takes 45 minutes to get a simple roti. go to the amazing c & w near leicester square.",2
"quick to get us in and sat down, ordered and served. the food was very well priced and tasted good, would recommend for a more casual but authentic experience.",5
staffs not friendly and hygienics rating to 2. we can imagine how dirty is in the kitchen,2
just like in malaysia! ,5
nice stop in chntwn,4
good malaysian food have been going for many years hasn't let me down,5
my favourite place for malaysian food in london. small tables and quick turn around. non fussy atmosphere. do try the mackerel and the aubergine with anchovies,5
"good food, average size portion and bad service. just for a quick bites, not really great for the long dinners.",3
"amazing malaysian food served fresh! one of my best, although rasa sayang beats it by a tad!",5
the food was a bit pricey for the amount that i got,3
tasty food ,5
service could have been better but prices were reasonable for that area of london.,3

yummy. great food selection. well priced. fast service. authentic.,5
"the food was very delicious, the service was good too. i would come back next time i'm in london",5
"you get exactly what's promised for a very reasonable price - quick service (you can't book and won't be seated until the whole group has arrived), the food was delicious, a huge variety on the menu and a great central location! i had the hainanese chicken rice with iced milk tea, both of which were excellent. thoroughly recommend.",4
unfortunately all the foods we ordered did not taste authentic at all,1
very good malaysian cuisine,4
a bit pricey but it is good food.,4
good malay food!!,4
amazing food for whoever like south east asian food. especially i like set menu with coconut chicken curry.,5
great malaysian food at a reasonable price,4
ordered a nasi lemak for a take-away. charged 11.90 when the menu said something else. the lady argued that the price wasn't 'updated'. the food was rubbish. this is a disgraceful version of this popular malaysian dish.,1
"food is good. unfortunately, it's prices just went up in the new year across the whole menu. for example, nasi lemak is 10.50 and penang prawn noodles is 11.50 (with mixed vermicelli and egg noodles). similar items can be had at coconut tree at bang bang for much less.",3
decent malaysian chinese food... a bit pack but staff was attentive...,4
"great laksa, good bak kut teh, comforting malaysian and singaporean dishes for cheap prices",4
i always pop in here once in a while. amazing food and nice fresh juices. i always leave full and happy :),4
a great place to eat delicious food! the portions are huge and the price is reasonably  priced! the food tasted fresh and i would definitely recommend the singapore laksa.,5
great malaysian restaurant - helpful staff. very popular. quick service but not rushed.,4
"highly recommend the hainanese chicken rice here! they use the thigh and they definitely do the rice correctly by cooking in chicken stock. the chicken was juicy and filled with taste, love it. missing it now! do not recommend getting the fried tofu with peanuts and shrimp paste sauce.",5
"we enjoyed it so much that we went twice. by chance we had the same young gentleman server who is very helpful in helping us make a decision. we had no clue what we were ordering and we're very very happy with what we got. we can't wait for our next trip to london, we are sure to go there again.baltimore, maryland usa",5
great food and prices,5
"relaxed atmosphere, quick service, delicious food. i don't know much about malaysian food so don't know how authentic it is but what i had tasted lovely. drinks seem slightly overpriced but the meal was great and very filling!",4
some items strangely overpriced and not that great overall. to remove shrimp and add tofu costs 1.50. few vegetarian options. wont be coming back.,2
fantastic authentic malaysian / indo / singaporian food in a clean and modern restorant. would definately eat here again if im in london,5
"food is really nice, only ever had to wait 10 mins at the most for a table. always packed with people,  service is good. shy off one star as the last time i visited the hot food was partially cold.",4
lovely asian cuisine. had the singapore laksa - nice spicy coconut broth. brisk service. would come back to try other dishes if time allows (am travelling),4
this is my ultimate new favourite restaurant. i no longer feel i need to fly all the way to malaysia to experience authentic food. this place is awesome. order the lemon ice tea as well!,5
great service when we showed up late with a big crowd. amazing food will definitely be back,5
"had fried rice w lamb and spices. really good food at reasonable prices, just off the main passageways through chinatown.well worth the visit!",5
so yummy! loved the curry,5
not been here in a while food is good as usual.  i can't give it five stars as it's not the best hokkien mee i've had.,4
a treasure tucked away from busy streets of chinatown. the chicken rice was delicious and great comfort food. lovely malay milk tea and yummy morning glory. satay chicken however was very dry and when it arrived cold and too greasy.,4
"one of the best malaysian restaurants in london, worth the wait, great value!",5
hokkien mee is the most authentic i've had in london!,5
favourite restaurant for malaysian. portion used to be much bigger.,5
fair quality for its price. considering its central london it is cheap.,2
"after entering and ordering  the simplest plates on the menu took over 25 minutes to serve a simple egg fried rice and a satay chicken, while other people got seated and served within that time. overpriced satay that was cold by the time the rice arrived and the worst egg fried rice ever.never again.",1
consistently excellent food and quick service. everything on the menu looks tempting and everything i ever eat is delicious. can't recommend enough,5
the food was mainly malaysian and really delicious.  i was so hungry i forgot to take a picture of the meal i was having! will go back again,4
"when i eat here it's like i'm back in malaysia again. the food is all great, i've been a few times and everything i've ordered has been so lovely (especially the laksa which i struggle not to order every time!) have lived in london for years and this is one of the top places i've eaten.",5
i saw this place in timeout. good restaurant. the quality was good and the price too. i recommend it.,4
best penang laksa outside malaysia. and relatively inexpensive for the locale. highly recommended.,5
my favourite malaysian place in london flavourwise. interior & bathrooms aren't the best,4
cnr has been my go to place for cheap eats and quality malaysian food in london for many years. i love their roti chanai.,4
"can get crowded over the weekend so plan ahead. portions are quite large and very reasonably priced. if you want good food, then a good place to visit.",4
9 each soup (very big ones),4
decent thai massage for people who like firm pressure lol,4
"my chinese friend suggested i go here for a hair cut, but being only half chinese and my mandarin not very good, i couldn't communicate with any of the hairdressers! i got a disastrous hair cut to say the least, and i was growing it out for 6 months or so. don't come here if you arent fluent in mandarin/cantonese! ",2
this is the worst place... my friends can not believe what they have done to my hair.btw: this is the first time i give a one star,1
"decent comfy environment, very good stylists who understand asian hair. the other services look good too with a 5+1 package deal which i'll consider taking up.",5
"excellent place in chinatown for a massage. i recommend alex,very professional and dedicated to her job. i will return.",5
came here for a emergency haircut & dye before going on holiday was quite busy however they manage to get me a stylist and did a great job. a special touch like offering a drink would've been nice.,4
very good massage. the decor is slightly tired perhaps but its clean. the staff and friendly and helpful. worth a visit.,4
"closed already, some barbers moved to miko hair studio, also in china town",4
fantastic service and very welcome! i went there for my nail and hair done and it was nice experience but if they can play more relaxing music that will be even better. i already recommend to my friend.  ,4
"had an aromatherapy massage after work which was amazing! he made me feel relaxed and at ease, i didn't want the 50 minutes to be up! great location, in the heart of soho but the studio itself feels calm and miles away from its surroundings, would definitely go back.",5
"this is my one stop shop when i'm visiting london. i get a massage, a manicure/ pedicure and my hair done. great prices. really friendly staff.",5
"i have been using the hair and the nail treatment as well, really good service. polite staff, really professional. i will be back",5
my friend bought me a voucher from groupon for shellac nails. they look awful! i could have painted them better myself. they are that bad that i tried to go into another salon to have them removed but they were fully booked! i will definitely not be going back here...they must have seen the shellac was a tacky half hearted job!,2
"i had an amazing massage with jerry it was really relaxing and helpful, my neck and my shoulder were really stiff but afterword i was feeling great. the environment is really nice and the staff professional and kind, i really recommend it to everyone that wants to enjoy an amazing treatment, i will definitely come back",5
"do not buy their groupon, they will not let you book appointment times even though they are specified within the fine print. they completely discriminate against groupon holders, and will make it so hard to make an appointment you just give up.",1
professional salon,5
great,5
massage here is amazing. ,5
"waited 30 minutes in the lounge for a hair cut. i asked the guy to just cut my hair shorter but gave me a completely different and stupid style, for 24. guy keep talking on his mobile phone. not going back againnice lounge music though",2
come here for a year ! highly recommend . trinity and momo here are amazing with hair cut and lyn is so good at head massage . staffs are friendly .,5

good roast duck and chinese dishes.  portion are generous and prices reasonable.recommended for chinatown london.,5
small jammed in like sardines .food nice but pricey,3
great duck on rice,5
we visited tpt for the first time today. the food and service was fantastic. we had scallops for starters and the honey pork hawker dish for mains. honestly some of the best food we have eaten in years. we'll be visiting again soon!,5
one of my favorite asian restaurants in london. authentic and delicious dishes. just keep in mind that the place is really small.,5
typical bad hong kong service. the impatient waiter talked to us in an extremely unpleasant tone and later threw the fried noodles to our table. i would never visit any restaurant owned by hongkongese anymore.,2
great food customer service needs to be worked on,3
everything is delicious!,5
"this place is awesome, that's all i have to say, best chinese in london, really",5
good chinese restaurant,4
"i've actually never eaten in here but this place gives me a good and reliable fix of a chinese takeaway. seems to have a very big menu with malaysian options, shall give that a try later, e.g. ckt. not quite sure whether i'd choose to eat in here though (as said, good for takeaways)",4
"good for cravings for hong kong food, especially the desserts.  just slightly expensive",3
"nice food, worst service attitude !",2
terrible service,1
not welcoming for entrance but very nice food and open till late,5
i have been coming to this place for years.  lovely food.,4
this place has slid downwards as their prices have hiked upwards. very mediocre chinese fayre in basic setting - all prices around the 8 - 10 mark.***visitors to london*** please avoid. this place is an old school throwback and not indicative of the food/ value available in london,2
our fave place in chinatown! the singapore noodles are ace!,5
the honey roast pork is pretty gosh darn good,4
good chinese street food.,5
my chicken didnt look fully cooked and  the rice potion was a bit small . the food is quite tasty but nothing amazing or memorable especially for the price ,3
"very friendly stuff, food tastes almost like the one i had in china",5
"my choice of restaurant in chinatown, simple and cheap. open late.",4
a regular here :) love this place.,5
"the food is so so, but the desert is very good.",4
ok food ,2
lovely little place for crispy duck...,5
great hot pots,5
great duck!,5
the food makes up for the service,4
"good desserts, good neighborhood food and very bad service ",3
"this was hands down the worst chinese food ever. two flavourless noodle dishes with a slimy sauce. the fatty duck was okish, but the bill consisted of a random exaggerated number scrawled on a piece of paper. we got fooled by all the good reviews. stay clear of this place!",1
no responsibilities in food or service.,1
god someone please get rid of the staff ,1
amazing food,5
duck pancakes are a must. ,5
good portions,3
roast duck was nice,5
poor food. lacking flavour,1
asking you to finish faster and go also when you pay your bill they will tell you 10% off by cash but no receipt for them to avoid the taxes what a business,1
best chinese street food in london (bar none) - be sure to have the milky tea (like a te tarik),5
food not good at all comparing to other res in china town. i can say it is the worst in there. staff charged us extra for no reason and without telling.,1
"nice chinese restaurant with a bunch of chinese visitors. not the cheapest though, at 20 pound per person.",5
amazing tofu dessert with good price,5
"this has been my fave chinese haunt for several years, delicious cantonese street food, reasonably priced, menu can be overwhelming like most chinese restaurants. best dishes to get our the boneless roast duck, curry beef flank and braised brisket hot pot.",5
"i cant imagine how could i survive my life in london without cafe tpt. for people with chinese background, food from here tastes like home.",5
dumplings are fantastic. the service really nice. good quality price food. i needed to charge my mobile and they were super helpful with it. totally recommended.,5
"been here twice. always quick and friendly service. great authentic food, also good veggie options. would recommend the chilli and salt tofu (or prawns) and the laska (soup / ramen dish).",5
extensive menu! one of my friends particularly liked their black pepper beef,5
i love it. variety of dishes to try!,5
really good chinese food. we had great nuddels and  peking duck and we loved it. this is an authentic chinese restaurant. great service.,5

great fast tasty chinese food at reasonable price!,5
"cane late at night and was still busy, good was nice but all seemed a bit rushed",4
"meat in vegetarian noodle dish, small pieces of bone in duck noodle soup as well as overall average food loses this restaurant two stars, despite its fast service. would not recommend.",3
get past the less than beautiful interior and enjoy the great food,4
"food was exceptionally good, fast service and clean cafe. perfect if you don't want to pay double for a restaurant with a tablecloth",5
"went for the set menu for 2 which included the duck pancakes. loved every dish. the staff were friendly, the service was quick. would definitely recommend this restaurant for some tasty dishes.",4
"excellent food.  service from rex was incredibly kind, personable, and spot on regarding the food.  great place, great people.  thanks, rex!",5
"great food. it's almost always super busy, so there can be a queue for a table. once you have a table and have ordered the food comes very quickly. we went with a good of five, got a huge circular table and had a nice chat over dinner.",5
service was so quick. food was amazing. we ordered super fast as we had to go to the theatre and they totally understood. got the food to us so quick and we then asked for the bill. bill came within minutes. would recommend,5
"quick, tasty, generous, wide variety of genuine  chinese foods at very reasonable prices, in a humble setting worth regular patronage .",4
the food is very good and the price is reasonable. staff also good serve. i give 4 star because the dessert.,4
"the service just ok, but the food was not ok...",2
"it's a hit or a miss with dishes. some are good while others taste bad.place is always crowded and tables are so close to each other you might elbow food of fellow eaters from other table.like many china town restaurants, service is all about optimising for time to make more money and less about guest comforts.",3
"dumplings were good , enjoyed a nice meal with my partner and service was friendly",4
perfect eat and perfect personal. thank you,5
how to place you going to go for the decor but the food is ok. the staff were helpful the portions are pretty good. we found the duck to be excellent the vegetables a little bit generic the crispy roast pork very good but the spicy beef dish was average at best.,3
best place in chinatown,5
interesting food in relaxed surroundings,4
very tasty food,5
"stumbled upon here as our usual ""go to"" was closed for refurbishment.",5
"special fried rice 9.20, i thought it came with a portion of chicken, but no, it was in the rice - really! dumplings were limp, not cripsy. all in all felt ripped off...i'll be sticking to the major chains from now on, at least you know what you're getting!!!",2
best crispy pork you'll ever eat,5
an extensive menu of classic chinese street food dishes in a cozy setting with light wood interiors.,5
"typical chinese street food. the environment is not pleasant, we found short hair in our plate and long hair in the dish. they say nothing, just take it away. disgusting!!!",1
great share option. 15 for a set menu and everything was delicious.,4
"picture : mango and sago dessert. it's pretty okay, sweet and cold and gets the job done, but tastes overly fake. like i know it's fake, but if food could talk this dessert would be holding a megaphone yelling, ""i'm made of fake processed stuff.""",3
"really good service. flavourful duck!! very popular, so be prepared for a wait during dinner time. went with a very happy vegetarian. will come again.",4
i went here and was quite nice. i had the crispy noodles with crispy pork but they gave some sauce which was basically a kind of slime. might go back again but will try something different on the menu to be completely honest.,3
"dishes cooked to a traditional taste, much appreciated by an elderly parent who's classically trained in clay pot cooking. well done!",5
"super friendly place serving great food in a chilled and simple setting. family friendly, able to cater for allergies. tastes fantastic also",5
expensive for the yaste of food.   bad customer service with grumpy staffs.,2
delicious food and friendly staff,5
decent food but subpar service. the waitress literally whipped my drink away  from my mouth the second i stopped sipping!!! we were given the bill the minute we said we weren't ready yet for dessert and then out came the card machine. the dining room was half empty and it was so unnecessary to rush us through. would not recommend.,3
nice meal good fast service.,4
"food is decent and service quick , but they won't let you have a table if you're just looking for dessert options.  ",3
simple rustic cantonese street food,5
good dessert menu,4

a favourite for authentic chinese street food. and the staff are always lovely <3,5

good service and good chinase food,4
"yummly chinese, hk & taiwanese food. meals are huge. loved it.",5
love the hong kong  style food.,5
"cheap chinese lunch menu available.  3 courses with chinese tea for under a tenner in central london is not to be sneezed at. one star off a full house because the portions have gotten smaller recently, as if a few extra mouthfuls of rice will create worthwhile savings when compared to the loss of goodwill.  ",4
loved the food here! literally came looking for it....the malaysian fried rice,5
"fantastic place for chinese food. great options, service is fast. the beef pot that i tried was absolutely amazing.",5

the worst chinese food that we ever had. the only thing that was good in our order was the prawn crackers. such poor options for veggies. will not even bother checking in here again.,1

"superb food, great quality and taste. large portions.",5
average food and okay prices considering its central london... theres better food next door at four seasons though (only very slightly higher price point)!,3
"very crowded and dirty place, the cantonese food served there is less than ok",2
food is fine but the area is small.,4
unbelievable food and service was very good definitely recommend,5
no frills. brisk service. open until 1am. especially enjoy the green beans and hawker dishes.,5
"excellent sago with coconut and mangoand a very large size. average hong kong milk tea. the sago is the one you want to order, and there are several choices. of course they offer regular cantonese-style food as well. (january 2018)",5
really nice food- the set menus are fantastic and really great value!!,5
"food was good, a bit greasy but overall pleasant. there were cockraches in the bathroom and one made its way out in my shoe... makes me ask all sorts of questions.",2
too salty,2
delicious food and no nonsense!,5
nice food & juice.,5
nice food. if you can find you love food here then it is a great place. very nice roast duck and pork.,5

"the best dessert in chinatown ""sweet bean curd""",5
"i'm not the gourmet, i like most of the food. however, this time we order 3 courses two are disappointing and they are very costly. i should have gone to wang kei!!!!",3

"wasnt as good as expected. service was a little unfriendly and the menu we ordered was not that special. the vegetable soup had a strange consistency, as well as the tofu.",2
"food is fast, good and cheap, but the service. oh, the horrible service. the dour staff's sole directive is to get you to order asap, eat asap, pay asap, and boot you out asap. don't bother if you're looking for anything more than an extremely basic feeding exercise.",1

quite good food but service is.........,2
"very authentic hong kong style food, the hot milk tea is better than explataion",5
my go to place for my late night chinese cravings when i am in the city. don't miss it. try the hot pots.,5

this is literally the worst chinese meal we've ever had. one of the dishes contained cornflakes fried with egg and cheese. overpriced. had to request soy sauce and sweet chilli sauce- got attitude from the waiter when i asked for a glass of water. such a shame. will never go back. ,1
"i am from malaysia and the laksa here is number one, with the sambal chili on the side, it is simply to die for.",5
"good food, and dessert. top choice in china town.",5
ordered choi sum in broth......  but theres no soup lolllllll,4
terrible hainanese chicken rice. the worst i've had in london.,1
"my fried beef noodles was average and portion wasn't all that generous. same goes for the ""lo hon zai"" vegetable dish. perhaps need to try the  roast meat dishes next time.",3
"great food, love this place",5
one of the best in china town.,5

"so good!!! we loved the shrimp dumplings soup, you must eat here",5
"excellent dessert, can be quite crowded so don't attempt to linger around.",4
5 star food...,5

large range of dishes. didn't have to wait long. and they have hong kong style tea too! :),5

finally found my tofu faaaaaaaaaaaaaaa :),5
"good food, reasonably priced, great staff",5
this is a really nice place to dine but it is really busy during the peak hours so i try to get in early.,5
one of my favourite eateries to visit when in soho.,5
great place serving good quality hong kong style food with helpful staff. i had the roast meat with rice and was not disappointed at al! the red bean ice was also refreshing and fresh. a golden oldie in china town!,5
not bad! love their milk tea,4
my favourite chilli tofu,5
"the roast duck and roast pork must try. it is crispy. but the cantonese roasted pork taste is so so. for drink, hot soya drink is not bad.",4
the service is bad! i can feel the service is so different between asian and european people. this is racism!!!!!! i never come again!!!!!!,1
excellent deserts and coffee n awesome cakes.wonderful staff helps all the way i strongly recommend this shop,5
ive seen a small mouse wondering behind the display cake and my table that was next to it and the cake was a bit dry and not to much flavour i will never go back again ive seen the mouse again before i finish to write the review,1

pure class,5
"cozy caf with polite staff and manager, the irish coffee served was to strong for my girlfriend, and we were kindly given a new one for free.",5
warm cosy place with great options. no black pudding though ,5
fine place to eat in and later some desert,5
"went to have dessert there but they had just a few of the options in the menu. also, the service was slow, considering the small place and being half empty. apart from that, the essert we had was nice.",3
love this franchised,5
good desserts that open later than many other. friendly service too. just a little bit more expensive than the others.,4
"we ate a late lunch at this caffe concerto, and were highly pleased by everything, especially by the service from soare and sergio!  soare gave my wife an extra little dessert for our 40th anniversary.  as american tourists in london for a week, this little place has been the best!  5 stars!",5
"great cake and coffee, good place for a tea",4
the place was nice and the good was good. nice place for a small family. afternoon tea is a really nice way to sit down and talk,4
"food looked better than it was, just buy the gelato stay away from the rest of the menu",3
"went in the middle of the day on a friday. not too busy, had drinks, staff were very friendly.",5
lovely food..... nice sweet but too sugary,4
"never fails to impress -lovely food , good service",5
"as with all cafe concertos, it's overpriced and the service is okay but it's open late and it's nice enough if you're with family or a few friends and fancy a coffee. i don't know why anyone would eat here, but it seems popular with tourists. whilst this is one of the better branches, i'd avoid this tourist trap if you can.",3
it's food.  not great food.  the chicken avocado sandwich is served with too much mayo.  it was unappealing.  located next to the theaters they have a steady draw but if they were going on just food we.wouldnt try again,3
great little place for a quick snack. the luxury afternoon tea for under 20 for two was just the ticket. try with the bombay chai tea. lovely.,4
"good deserts and milkshakes, prices quite reasonable but quality tastes. i need to say that, the place is romantic  and classic.",3
manager a disgrace rude to two customersca member of his staff and a delivery man despicable little man,1
the desserts were really good. the pistachio cream was spot on!,5
"good food, very horrible service. i wouldnt recommend it if they kept the service like this.",2
excellent coffee cakes and calamari!!,5
"good food and good service, almost always seats available.",4
the manager sergio was amazing and really took care of our group. thank you for a great evening! we will be back very soon.,5
"we popped in for a coffee mid morning on sunday and were informed very rudely and arrogantly that they only serve coffee with food. rude and arrogant staff, we will not return to any of the branches",1
cake was good and the price is reasonable. i would recommend this place for those who are planning to buy a birthday cake .,3
"the food is nice, but not more than that. the coffee actually was not so tasty.about the rude stuff that others wrote, it looks like they not permit people sitting just for coffee. which is makes no sense, since the place is half empty.",3
fantastic location absolutely amazing customer service really really lovely salad and the biggest bit of chocolate cake,5
food was nice so was the ambience.  it wasn't that expensive either.,5
delicious food friendly staff and brilliant calm place. i liked it.,5
nice breakfast,4
high end coffee place. suitable for early morning one to one conversations.,3
fair price poor service,2
lovely caf to have coffee or lunch,5
"lovely place for pre show dinner, the food is amazing and we didnt wait long either i would definitely recommend it and will definitely come back here",5
excellent restaurant. they do a special afternoon tea from lunch time onwards. ideal stop before going to a theatre for afternoon performance. reasonable prices.,4
nice setting and decoration but that's as far is it goes. overpriced for what it is. only went for cake and coffee so can't comment on the rest of the food.,2
"only one person serving, only one person taking payments , cramped almost no space inbetween tables but why run a  service when you can't even accomodate all guests ? this place is a joke",1
"pretty cakes and store, average coffee",3
great afternoon tea with good selection of cakes and sandwiches. staff are also very friendly.,5
"overpriced, but then again, one can blame that on the location. but the quality is absolutely apalling. the eclairs are priced at 6 gbp each and are hard and tasteless. cakes are as well.overpriced and of very poor quality. a cheesecake from any supermarket would taste better than what these guys are selling. never stopping again.",1
latte was weak,1
the milk was bad. ,1
service not great.,2
great cortina ,4
good brekfast  ,5
terrible service! ,1
"1 latte, 1 cappuccino and 2 tea's plus two pieces of gateau cost a staggering 33.02. including 12.5% s/c",1
it looks a lot nicer on the inside than the outside and the staff are incredibly polite and efficient but the food was a little underwhelming.,3
amazing food from a fussy eater. thank you ,5
"excellent people  here, especially vito",5
tiramisu heaven!,5
loved the eclairs!,5
amazing cake and coffee,5
great coffe,4
excelent desserts! ,5
decent food but awful service.,1
amazing cakes ,5
very rude staff and even though it is advertised as a cafe they refused to serve us drinks unless we ordered cake so they asked us to leave. very bad service especially as the cafe was empty. ,1
lovely breakfast and good service,5
just came in for a snack and tried the non veg high tea style racks and a pastry was expensive and service was a bit slow overall it was ok .the potato wedges and the tartare sauce were very tasty,4
the cake is delicious. the italian lady staff is very friendly and beautiful.,5
excellent ambiance and service,4
amazing place.. i was there whit my friend.. the manager armando was excellent and professional whit us!! i will come back soon ,5
"food is good, however a bit overly sweet. however service is slow, they focus more on keeping the restaurant clean rather than serving you. ive been waiting for 20 minutes for a check even though my food has been cleared",3
just had a coke... good ambience though,3
just went in to buy a takeaway cake. was told to stand by the door until summoned. walked out.,1
caff concerto it's a nice place where you can eat a cake and drink a coffee. maybe the quality it's a little bit plastic and not exciting. but ok you can go there and enjoy a piece of cake,4
a great way to escape the crowds of tourists. always get a slice of cake.. or two. i recommend the caffe concerto hot chocolate.,4
the ruby latte looked nothing like the photo on the menu and it tasted nothing like the description beetroot and ginger!!,2
very good food,5
delicious scones. the perfect afternoon tea for two or three. attentive waiters. we had a lovely afternoon.,5
"great desserts and milkshakes. prices are ok but sometimes are different on receipt than on menue. how can that be? also, the lavatories were neither clean nor working, and super smelly; men's & women's both!",3
"terrible customer service, cold coffee, waiter was very rude! cakes were horrible, tasted like yesterdays cakes! overall terrible experience! very disappointed!",1
food and service both excellent,5
nice atmosphere and good food,5
my favourites are the duck salad and cakes.,5
very nice tea for two lunch time.,4
enjoy lunch with the kids great food great staff,5
"visit twice during my holiday in london, and was blown away, by the standard of the food. simply devine and very well price. great service by the waiter, pear and duck salad is simply a must. will visit again on next trip.",5
"good service, good food, thanks for that moment",5
"if terrible is 1 and disgusting is 5, on 1-to-5 scale, they score 7.",1
"i have reserved 2 cakes with lady and then waited called florin came and took one of my reserved cakes , didnt even say sorry or any kind of apology , then when i was paying he was smiling to my face like he done it on purpose . cakes are nice from there , but service not that well",1
"i love the scone , the best i ever eat. will come back, the softness n the butter smell is surp.",5
desserts are actually good but the waiters on duty are not that friendly or cheerful even it was not busy at that time. i was disappointed with the service ive been served.,3
good service and nice coffee had pancakes which were very nice altough a little too sweet,4
"i ordered my birthday cake, a millefeuille with fruits on top. it was amazing, everyone loved it!!the staff was helpful and kind. thanks",5
everything is delicious,5

"delicious food, especially the english breakfast. recommended. ",5
best cakes from here and able to set a date on when you can collect,5
"terrible. on being seated we were harrassed by 3 different waitresses in as many minutes to order. food was average, except for the tea bags which were made of plastic. i don't want a drink of hot neurotoxins thank you.",1
ridiculous service and took my coffee away when it was still half full!,1
amazing breakfast. great value as well. thank you,5
ideal location for pre-show for several theatres. ambiance and menu a cut above the chain coffee shops. super cakes.,4
"one of my favourite caffe concerto, not only the location is great but the service is outstanding. i always go for the afternoon tea and though is not the best in the city you get a great variety and quality for the price.",4
good food and friendly,5
lovely place for a hot tea,4
i stayed from 1am to 5am. lots of intesesting people there.,5
not worth your time your money. horrible staff. not nice unless you are dressed in some fancy clothes. very bad ,1
foods quality is middle but the service and waitress attitude is so bad. it might be at that time is christmas day but the other shops and caffees are not.,2
good choices of different sweet and coffee,4
great coffee and cake,5
quiet and romantic with lots of choice. great afternoon tea.,4
overrated overpriced bland coffee and poor cake. great service but nothing special.,2
drinks and prises are ok. but the staff is absolutely terrible. they are rude and very unfriendly. after we paid the waitress throw our change on the table. unbelievable!,2
"the place is located a corner and desert is good, however the fruits in the desert taste like old.",3
"afternoon tea with inedible bread. we had to scrape off the spreads to eat. the staff asked what was wrong, but no effort to correct the situation was attempted.",1
perfect coffee. nice place. ,5
nice cake and desserts but service is bad. they only talk to eachother and eating cake behind the bar???? that's not what you call quest service ... too bad. location and interior are realllly nice!,2
"nothing extraordinarily special about this place, way overpriced for the quality of coffee and cake here. ",3
"as lovely as the place looks we were refused service in this ""cafe"". apparently you are not allowed in just for coffee and need to either order dessert or food.",1
absolutly awful servise. nice food but i truely believe our waitress was high. ,2
"good taste, nice place. ",4
good food  & good service,5
service was poor. food was very disappointing. we originally went in for the deserts but decided to get dinner as well. all of it was very bland and overpriced.,1
tasty food but not great experience with the waiter. the waiter specifically asked for tips on top of the service charge,3
"tea and cake was good, however, service was horrible",2
"amazing afternoon tea, real vip treatment ",5
great cheesecake and earl grey tea,4
"ordered 4 pastries but none was fresh, ""fresh"" lemon juice tasted like it was made from concentrate. decent service, wouldn't visit again.",2
great coffee at reasonable rates,3
"really bad service experience, the waitress seems really rude and unwilling to help, we wait for our our cake for a loooog time even is not in a busy time .(the cake is already done, what they  need to do just take it to the table). anyway worst dining experience ever",1
excellent eggs benedict and pancakes at a very reasonable price.,5
the desserts are hit or miss. eclairs are dry if you go very late in the evening. but i had the most amazing custard pudding.,4
wonderful choice of drinks and cakes. just love this chain!,5
had a really nice breakfast here had an offer on if ordered before a certain time which i think was 11.30 so believe it was 2 cheaper than normal price really nice place too,4
"good desserts, definitely try their hot chocolate. it's delicious!",5
"great location. poor table service. several options on the menu were not available. cleanliness not great (e.g. dirty tables, napkins under the table, etc.)",2
nice atmosphere,4
great coffee experience. and special thank you to francesca always with an smile and even offered herself to charge my mobile with her personal charger. nice to find people so nice over the world!!!,5
"good food with a lot of choice, although slightly pricey. however the service wasn't brilliant. it took someone on the table next to us to alert a waiter to take our order, with a lacking friendly tone, and they forgot one of our plates at first.",3
the store is gorgeous with a lot of potential but there is such a lack of system on the service. the staff completely ignores the customers as well as potential customers that come in waiting to be seated. nobody approaches them and the coffee n cakes takes take ages to be served. tables stay dirty for long before picked up.shame,1
"it's not a very good place for breakfast. good coffee, but not cheap not complete.",2
good! delicious and friendly!,4
very unfriendly staff. i can not recommend it.,1
very friendly  and they gave my granddaughter a free croissant  xxxxxx,5
food looks multiple times better in the window then it tastes. definitely a tourist trap and a place to avoid.,1
"came in for coffee and cake, and mainly felt the staff's disapproving glares for hogging a table for just that. the coffee and dessert were nice but pricey. the interior feels...gilded, like a tourist trap dressed up as a posh cafe.",2
it celebrated new year's day here 2019 it was lit ,5
"great show, great staff and a fantastic venue. will definitely be returning. big thumbs up ",5
"great show, great atmosphere! some of the performers are super talented!! very good nice out ",5
the venue was spot on. the team knew exactly what they were doing in terms of food distribution . they were so open to making the evening totally customised  to our needs. would wholeheartedly recommend,5
"we booked for something different to do in london and it was amazing! the acts were unique and talented,with something for everyone! amazing saturday night!!!",5
"very good music, great staff, people nicely dressed and chic. overall an awesome night. we got a private table from alex. got his number on the club-bookers website",5
joni is a fabulous hostess who made our evening so special. the show was brilliant - thank you for a great evening out.,5
amazing night. had a great time and all the team were really full of energy and fin. great experience,5
one of the best nights of my life. dj was unreal. cant wait to revisit soon,5
"absolutely garbage nightclub. as a foreigner, we were charged overly expensive covers and drinks were unbelievably not worth the price. very weird mix of a crowd, staff is quite rude. one of the worst nightclubs in london.",1
"fantastic atmosphere, great music, people and staff, definitely will be going again !",5
"i've been a regular for a number of years here, it's the best place to bring family, friends and colleagues. the decor and ambience is truly impressive and the food is absolutely delicious! love this place",5
great venue - probably one of the best clubs in the area..,5
"geat night, food was good and the waitress was extremely helpful with everything. the entertainment was amazing and was completely different to what i was expecting, i haven't laughed so much in ages. the host was amazing and very funny. great night with great entertainment.",5
fantastic venue for our awards event! we have been going there for the last 6 years and have booked again this year. the staff are always fantastic and so helpful. the food is always delicious and the atmosphere perfect.,5
fantastic evening!! highly entertaining!,5
"me and a few of our friends decided to go, and we were suggested to book with alex from londonnightguide. he was very helpful and even suggested the venue for us. the club was spectacular, and we had a lot of fun while dancing all night and the dj kept spinning amazing hits. 100% recommend for any night out.",5
"i though if a place charges you 20 on the entrance as a standard price- it must be worth it. could be more mistaken. the place is small much smaller than it appears on the pictures, full of doggy people (the night when we went there). just a gin mill. do not recomend it if you value your money.",1
beautiful venue. show was amazing! stayed on for the club after and had a great night. will be returning for sure.,5
"it is an amazing place. it combines atmosphere, service; good food and a unique show",5
"nice interiors, but a tourist spot nonetheless.",4
fabulous evening yesterday 18.5.19 - amazing acts and a absolutely great mc - recommended.,5
great service and great music!! i will be back for sure!!,5
great night out recommend,5
i was very happy to spend a night here after club-bookers suggested it. great music and lovely people. we were 6 so we booked a table through club-bookers. highly recommend them,5
"great venue but aggressive securitys at the door and unprofessional managers, totally f useless",1
absolutely brilliant night. the show was amazing!! i was lucky enough to see the last show there ever! the food was excellent too!,5
"went here with a buy a gift voucher. not somewhere i would have chosen, but boy did we have s fantastic evening!! all the acts were amazing, the compare was hilarious although completely vulgar which was great! a great evening to spend with friends , food was pretty good too!",5
awful place. lined up to get in and they wouldn't let us in because the bouncers said they were not letting anymore males in the club. so we left but we noticed they were letting plenty of other males in. don't waste your time and energy coming here especially if there's black people in your group. racist horrible place,1
we have had the pleasure of creating events at this venue and going as guests and both experiences were fab! we had recently created a party for the telegraph where we built a scare attraction around the top half of the venue. it was a great night and we shall look forward to working here again and creating parties for our clients.,5
"visited for a xmas party with my company. good impression. venue is not massive, but scenic and cosy.",4
"was  a pity that not food allowed to be served with general admission. expensive admission fees having in consideration the prices for drinks. we came by 7 pm following their recommendation and show started 8:30 pm , so it became bit long waiting for us with not food. til 8 they have happy hour whats good.",3
great love the place,5
i've been to cafe de paris few times on friday &saturday night cabaret show. awesome acts and amazing show . beautiful club - highly recommended.,5
"i was seated quickly at the table as were the stragglers in our group.   waitress was attentive, polite and kept me informed when there was a delay in the food we ordered.   had a good night,  music was ok.",4
it's ok for a dance. very big space and lovely building.,3
great cabaret show and fire performance throughout the night!,5
false advertising for halloween entry and bad attitude when you question them about it. 14 for double vodka coke. poor halloween performances.,1
"loved every second of it, the staff and the shows are the best in london. would definitely recommend.",5
"loved it, insane cabaret like ive never seen before. trapeze, dancing, singing, a great host, this place has it all!",5
"i truly enjoyed the show, once of the best i have seen in london. food was good too and the staff was friendly. i would definitely come back!",5
"if you are looking for a place to have fun, choose cafe de paris! i had dinner there with my friends. the staff is really friendly, great waiter service. the burlesque show was great! disco was fantastic! i advise everyone to come and spend an evening at the caf de paris!",5
was here last night. dont listen to petty one star reviews. great fun and entertainment and prices are reasonable. i recommend vip dinner with the show. all round great night.,5
"incredible venue with incredible staff and incredible entertainment! every time i have visited, cafe de paris always provides a great experience. would recommend seeing the cabaret show - the acts are out of this world!!",5
"best night of my life, so much fun, would recommend 10/10",5
"great entertainment, friendly staff and easy procedure to get in ",5
one of the best club experiences in london would highly recommend .,5
"i had the best night ever. it was an amazing show.the only thing i was not very keen on the music played after the show. i was hoping they would continue playing disco music, as the show was based on disco 54.otherwise well done for a great show.",5
the toilets were horrible. skanky,1
it was okay. okay is the best i can say. service was quite good. but the food was average. the show was intermittent and throughout about 2 hours. i expected something more entertaining and more continuous. i dont think i would come back or recommend it to friends...,3
joe marose was amazing! keep up the good work all at cafe de paris!! thank you for the amazing experience joni!!! bon sour!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
"really nothing special. your usual cheesy, sweaty nightclub.",3
awesome show. we did not eat there but we went early and managed to find 2 decent seats. well worth every penny.,5
"just a few words to describe this place:amazing, great, stunny,... if you want to feel good, just go there.",5
"queing is ridiculous, takes 2 hours to get in with online bought tickets. bartenders aren't the best nor the kindest professionals either",1
went there for a friends bridal shower for the west end bottomless brunch. had an amazing night there ! the musical performances were amazing and the host was brilliant! i will definitely recommend going there if u are a lover of musicals and singing your heart out!,5
first time there and it satisfies my curiosity. will definitely go again. the entertainment was amazing. the music had me on the dancefloor most of the night. but the toilets are small for the crowd capacity.,4
the show is amazing!  that's what you go for.  the food is just meh.  and it's supposed to be a disco club? but the music changed to hip-hop after the show and we lost interest. but the show was still specular!!,4
"they rejected us because we were foreign, we're australian.",1
"worst halloween themed night i have ever been to. why do the bar staff cover the card machine when you pay for a drink? are they cheating us out of more money? music was awful, no real halloween theme to the night. boring performances",1
"caf de paris is an extraordinarily entertaining place, the acts are great, food is surprisingly delicious, the service is great, waiters are actually well attentive which is usually not the case with venues of this category. its classy, the cocktails and drinks are a little bit pricey but given the location its justifiable.",4
had such a lovely time celebrating my 25th birthday at cafe de paris! the staff were very attentive and the venue had such a fun atmosphere. highly recommended!,5
"the show was just wow. super quirky, funny, entertaining.",5
drink prices overrated entertainment music vibes dry better entertainment right outside,2
never again. i am very confused as to how they have remained opened this long.  i can relate to many of the negative experiences shared here. rude and beyond disrespectful door-staff.  do not care to give money to a locale that has no respect for their patrons.,1
had such a great night good service and the door staff are friendly enough music was great too loads of old school tunes,5
first time i was at cafe de paris from the suggestion of alex from club bookers. and i was not disappointed. the place was amazing! a bit pricy but other than that everything was great. book through alex as he will take care of everything! thanks alex ,4
saw the saturday night cabaret show. awesome acts and the mc was brilliant. beautiful club - highly recommended. arrive around 7pm if you are not having the dinner as you'll be sitting in the balcony and some seats don't have a good view of the stage.,5
poor choice of beer for such an expensive place. decor doesn't make up for the miserable staff.,2
gooooood one,5
"horrible security (entire team), unreasonable and rude. bars were alright but drinks overpriced. no experience handling a crowd and absolutlely wrong way to handle vip and customers who have paid for tables. waste of a prime location and venue, please change the management and security :)",1
they are very rude and humiliating.. they says only we need women . we need a ticket but they didnt accept us.. this was the funniest thing i've ever heard in my life... we need a women hahahshsh.. they are stupid.. dont go there never... :))),1
good function event venue  no parking as usual w1,5
great night entertainment was amazing staff very friendly recommend to anyone,5
an experience that shouldn't be missed! when visiting london reserve your table looooooong before your trip as spaces disappear very very quickly!!,5
"small place with not a very reasonable price on drinks and entry tickets. plus, the bouncers/ security guards are awful to say the least",1
ignore the 1 star rating as i am trying to remove the review that i left. this is the best i could do. at this point in time i was wrong to leave the review that i did and give the venue a 1 star rating. unfortunately i can not take down/completely remove the original post do this edot will have to do!,1
everything is bad just waste of money and time over charge drinks bot good dj,1
"ew do not go here!!!staff are disgusting, bouncers think theyre something their not.",1
"the saturday night show was amazing! me and my friends saw geat performances, hot women, awesome singers and a fantastic host of the show mr ruby kaye.",5
"i would give no stars if i could, i would not recommend at all specifically if you are a person of colour. was given no refund or reason for not be allowed in the club",1
"staff are just rude, wouldn't recommend this club for any occasion.",1
"it is a really lovely spot, offering fantastic coffees and goodies like blueberry pancakes. definitely a great non-chain cafe.",4
"anywhere that uses discriminatory behaviour  deserves no stars at all, it's the 21st century not the dark ages. overpriced and charge for using card, door keeper charges entrants what he feels like, the manager should have been paying us as he was worthless... let me know when you develop past the dark ages.",1
"had our staff christmas party here, terrible venue! appalling service and staff, rude and unhelpful",1
"awesome music, both electronic and hip hop. the vip section is very comfortable and overlooks the dance floor. had a lot of fun there with my girls.",5
"show was awesome but the second it ended we were hurded like cattle and forced to pour our drinks in a plastic glass and move on. it was a horrible sudden experience to a lovely evening & show. soon after the place took a dive and turned into a ""cheap"" nightclub and that was the end of our evening. but the show was amazing.",1
the people of the security decided that a friend of mine was drunk without any criterion. rude and unpolite staff. never again. go anywhere else or stay at home. worst people ever.,1
"good music, not the best vibe",3
i went through london night guide to the club caf de paris in london. the guestlist service was perfect.the club was really elegant and chic and the atmosphere with the art performers were amazing. it was a great time i would recommend it.,4
i had a very nice evening in this place.recommend,5
absolutely rubbish! rude staff..,1
we were forced out after the show by thug bouncers who insulted my wife and that after paying extortionate prices for our drinks. absolutely rubbish. ,1
awesome spot ,5
sony was very unpleasant,1
lush,5
loved the show and dinner!,5
"when we decided to go i wasn't expecting much from this place, but it was very wrong!brilliant start of the night out in london!guy who runs the show deserves an oscar!i would say this is one of must visit places in london. defiantly will be back.",5
"me and my partner visited last night, the venu was amazing and the staff are very friendly! a big thank you to our waitress jenna who went out of her way for us!",5
one big scam,1
awesome place. full of enjoyment..,4
"great place to party. i've been to a lot of clubs and there are always problems with staff/security, except for this club. the security and staff take their jobs seriously but are very nice to people and are always there to help. has amazing vibes as well. 100% recommend.",5
"disco54 ! so glad there such a place in london now, disco disco disco <3",5
really rude woman working there. asked a question and she started shouting to someone else in a different language and when she saw in still there waiting for an answer she started yelling at me is not her problem. luckily a few overpriced drinks later it wasn't so bad... will not be coming back ever,1
"great show and food. the bouncers wouldn't let me back in after leaving for a cigarette. my coat was still in the cloak room so i then asked if i could go get it and they called me a ""liar"". luckily i had my cloak room ticket on me. ruined my night",3
"although the caf is not completely accessible(not suitable for wheelchair users) i was welcomed at the door, i expedited through the entry process, escorted to my seat & staff constantly enquired as to whether i required any extra halp. very enjoyable afternoon.  definitely come again",5
brilliant night out,5
"if there was option for no star would have chosen it... absolutely discusting place! rip off entry and you get complete charade... overcrouded, waiting more then half an hour for drinks rude waiters no show worse nye everwarning do not waste your time and money going there!",1
"5 stars for the nightclub decor. despite some reviews the staff was polite. the crowd was a mix and a bit rowdy, would give 3 stars for that",4
very nice place. amazing shows and the theme. drinks and prices are as expected.,5
had a really lovely evening staff very helpful thanks jenna for being attentive. woild recommend ,5
thought about coming here for a birthday - but on these reviews with no response from whoever owns it - i'm not willing to take the chance.,3
"great night, great venue. back again soon!",5
"i would give less if i could.paid 50 for the new years entrance.no entertainment, songs were 5-10 years old!, it seemed like a normal night out, no indication that it actually was a new years eve.thank you for ruining my night, if i could turn back time, i would just stayed at home!",1
had an amazing halloween in cafe de paris. thank you all,5
"i really liked cafe de paris, it is always a great party and great place to relax and enjoying london nights.",5
"from pictures i had impression that this is posh club, but it's nothing like that. one tiny, dirty toilet with super long queue, crappy dance area in basement, rude security, staff treats you like - pay and f* off, high prices. definitely not worth it.",1
amazing place !!!,5
loved it! can't wait to go back! booked with london night guides. highly recommend,5
"indecent, arrogant and aggressive security staff. total rip-off when buying drinks. bouncers without any decency.not worth a visit, only good for losing a few 1000  !",1
great burlesque show.,5
this place is a racist institution. they love to threaten people. i was taken to a random backdoor place and not allowed to leave albeit regurtitating my rights as a human being. i am going to call the police. best believe that.,1
great place for private party,5
"great westend entertainment! cabaret, fire acts, comedy... lots going on",5
we seem to be another group that experienced 'attitude' from the bouncers.put a real damper on the evening - especially as ot was a friend's birthday.cannot honestly recommend.,2
"attempts to label itself as one of london's finest clubs and it indeed tries to charge you as such. they tend to hold back the ""better"" looking girls in the queue disregarding the weather as to attempt to lure in drunk males in way that you could only describe as objectifying.rude, arrogant and utterly unenjoyable.",2
the best place for a paris styled vibe in the centre of london,5
"awful drinks, bad dj huge cover charge (20). table service not existent. can not recommend this. ",1
"got the vibe,  could be good...  but just another club that offers the same thing and act like theyre fancy.  you are also charged an extra 3 pounds if you pay by card at the bar. just a rip-off.  dj is ok too..  nothing special and the crowd is so so",2
"beautiful interior. show was ok, nothing special. barely a nipple. first come, first serve seating (unless you rsvp) so get there early to actually get a decent view.",3
"highly overrated place. drinks are very expensive, is much smaller than the pictures suggest. it is existing a an anciently hyped reputation. better go to the w around the corner. dj is terrible and has no sense of what moves a crowd.",2
luxury exspensive,5
"food was okay, drinks were free, and the show was decent, a good company christmas party to say the least.",3
"awful , over priced .. drinks are expensive. entry is expensive 20 it was empty on friday night . music was not bad though .. u just need to get drunk to enjoy it !!!",1
"i came to this club randomly, being in central .. i guess the location made up for the prices. it picked up around 12am when the rnb etc came on. the security need to relax a little and i don't think i'll be buying drinks there haha. i'll come again and the inside is beautiful.",4
stunning setting. amazing artists. wonderful show. great experience.,5
my first experience at caf de paris left much to be desired i returned after being assured this was a once off and my second experience was brilliant. ,4
hears great thing. but wasn't impressed. queue for drinks was ridiculous,3
"very good experience, super fun and really enjoyed it. nick in particular was very accommodating and super helpful. definitely will be returning!",5
went on saturday and i had a really good night. if go almost monthly and the staff are always very warm and friendly. the show always lives up to expectations. this is one of the finest places to spend your saturday night in the west end,5
oh what an experience.i enjoyed it very much. l went on my own through a meet up group.there was the awesome cabaret which started at 8:30 and ended at 10then the place was turned into a club. under a minute walk from the piccadilly circus,5
lovely staff. nice interior. great music. fabulous performance. buzzing and electrifying environment. highly recommended,5
my fiance and i visited cafe de paris in early december 2019 for their three course dinner and cabaret evening. the food was delicious and the cabaret was excellent. the acts were of an incredibly high standard with a brilliant and hilarious host. we can't wait to visit again with friends!,5
"ive honestly never been so well treated . as a wheelchair user i was treated and looked after so well, better than any other bar or club ive ever visited by far! staff were amazing and treated us amazingly well! will recommend this place to anyone , any time",5
"went here for a private party, it was a good venue and layout however it was like your standard clubs. ",3
best night out weve had in a long time. the show the food and the music were brilliant. highly recommended!!!! we will defiantly be back. thank you x,5
"went for their saturday cabaret evening. the master of ceremonies was hilarious, brilliant acts, excellent show.",5
perfect for an event,5
each time i am there it's such a rush! keep up the good work you guys! :)),5
very bad security unhelpful manager ruined our night,1
"racism, after having bought 2 bottles with my friends, they threw us out for being romanian, nothing else, in that club we do not admit romanians bulgaros or ungaros, it's shameful",1
"went for a private party, lovely venue but i can't really comment on anything else",3
loved the burlesque  show great entertainment laughed hard and often,5
"the sort of club you go to if you're from outside london and you've heard this place is good. it's like a big essex nightclub - tacky. no edge, nothing interesting happening.",2
"what am amazing night!!! booked here for our work summer party, we all arrange from different ages and we all had such amazing time. drinks are a bit expensive. ",5
nice place for a saturday night although may be hhard to get in if you come after 10pm. beautiful interior especially chandelier. good fun for clubbing. ,4
"worst night of my life. bouncers are rude. the club is dead. a shot costs 7. ended up leaving the club at 12. go to zoo just around the corner, defo reccomend.",1
the dj changes songs just when it gets good frequently. but it is still a pretty place and the dress code is not so strict although everyone does dress to the nines there,3
"decent club, prices were pretty dear but music was good",5
"it's a nice venue, food not what i expected but still had a great time here.",3
beautifully glamorous place that requires a dress code. the dress code of overly insecure guys who think they can get laid with girls that just want to drink and have a bit of fun. staff is really nice and the architecture is beautiful..with all the money spent on glamour there is little budget left to hire good dj's. ,2
"caf de paris is an atypical club, it looks like a cabaret and the atmosphere is great! i went on a saturday night with friends, we book a table through luxguestlist and we were treated like vips. performers enliven the party and the atmosphere becomes hot. i highly recommend it :)",4
"expensive, bad persons, bad idea to go there and have some drinks.",1
over priced drinks. one toilet. definitely not going back.,2
"cdp london far exceeded our expectations! sevens sins is magnificent! thank you to keith and the entire professional, attentive, polite  and bubbly team. a magnificent evening, surpassing value for money.",5
"promoters approach groups saying they will give you free drinks. once you pay 20 pounds, drinks never arrive to table and they move you to vip like they are making you a favour. once you are there the drink was not even vodka, tasted like water with orange juice. then they get more people to the downstairs area and so on.",1
nice place but i hope the staff would be more friendly.,3
an historic (and rather cheesey) club. see if you can access the vip room which is home to 4 or 5 beds. wonder what goes on in there!,3
nice place to relax,5
"rude staff, first 30 minutes we did not run, they have there that the equipment was then at the entrance to have demanded  20, when we had the vip area, drinks were cheap, coca cola was terrible, i did not like! do not go there, choose something interesting on and where staff are not rude!",2
reflective of paris but not my favorite,2
great cabaret show on saturday nights. good food and great club night afterwards.,5
awesome venue. i fell in love with it's atmosphere straight away. i want to go back or better still work there as a photographer,5
"the worst place i ever been in my entire life...ive been in all club in london and i definitely think that this one is the worst one , they promote it like something big but i want give them  even 2 star ...ive read all review of other client and im disgusted .",1
music was rubbish. floors were sticky. drinks were overpriced even for soho. temporary bar was even set up behind a table that night. looked very amateur. whole place needs a revamp. dont be fooled by the name and photos. ,2
"the building itself is impressive, but neither the drinks nor the service were great. the security  was straight up rude, the bartender spilled my drink, and in general, all staff members were unkind. the music was only enjoyable if you had many glasses of alcohol. considering the prices and exclusivity, it's a huge disappointment.",2
"i was fortunate enough to attend a private event at this place. great space, great location.",4
never go here. they took 20 each from my entire party and then refused to let us in. when we complained and asked for our money back we were physically removed from the building. complete scam with terrible staff who hate their customers.,1
"great when there's live music, you're right there up close to the band",5
amazing show!!,5
"dont be fooled by these reviews! rude service, below average quality and overpriced! waffles were not homemade...",1
artificial tasting but delicious,4
"great cozy place to visit, relaxing environment and good value as well, staff working there are very friendly. ideal place to chill or go to with friends",5
"great desserts, reasonably priced. i especially like the hot soup desserts but the menu has quite a wide choice. quite hard to find though if you don't know where to look. i like taking friends here!",5
the place is cozy. the food is good and special. having been searching for taro ball for a long time... thanks!,5
nice music and food. hidden away cosy place.,4
cozy place to hang with friends. food quality is subpar.,3
affordable and yummy desserts! really cosy which i love and just a nice atmosphere.,4
authentic bubble tea and desserts. can get busy. good for a pit stop.,4
"great price, plentiful menu and tasty dessert. highly recommended ",5
i came here for a meet and greet experience and i was really pleased with the visit overall. i had a hazelnut latte and my friend had a strawberry smoothie and both were delicious. the music is fantastic and its very cosy. the staff are sweet and helpful and the prices are very reasonable. will definitely come again!,5
"really nice cafe tucked away in china town. i tried a bit taro milk tea with tapioca, coconut and lychee jelly...really impressed. will try some dessert next time. a bit small inside but atill a great little corner to chill and grab a drink. 5/5 for service. see you guys next time i'm in china town.",4
cozy place. friendly service. they have plenty of bubble teas and desserts selection. loved the watermelon one. went with friends yesterday and really had a nice time.,4
"the waffer at this place is always so good! and there are loads of other options to chose from for sweets and desserts! the cafe itself is a bit hidden, but thats what made  comfortable like secret hideout.(*`*).",5
nice deserts from hong kong,4
very friendly staff. desserts weren't too sweet. a bit overpriced.,4
absolutely awful. it was a disgusting dessert! way overpriced for such a small portion! definitely not worth going too! and the worse thing was the service charge - 1:50 extra just because we didnt buy another item?! never going back. unpleasant experience!,1
"cozy and neat little cafe. dessert are nice, staff is friendly too. maybe a bit expensive for just sweets, but the presentation does look good and the dessert/sweets are also not bad. recommended",4
tucked in one of the side streets in china town is this little beaut. it' a tiny tiny dessert restaurant but you won't be disappointed,3
very tasty and yummy...highly recommended...love it...,5
"small little place with lots of items on the menu. usually get a crepe and a tea. taste and priced are not bad. good for a couple friends, but like i say, it's a small place so it may be busy often.",3
small place but a nice atmosphere and great service.,5
not bad,5
lovely place for meet-up and an experience of cantonese after dinner drinks,3
lovely deserts  definitely a hang out spot with friends.,5
"i visited on a quiet evening where there were 2 or 3 groups of people, the desserts were delicious.",5
the deserts were nice and the service was fast. you can't reserve a table so go early. it is a small cafe so we had to squeeze into a small booth area. they have a tv but it was playing korean or chinese music videos. there are a lot of small stairs to climb before you get to the cafe as well.,3
"horrible service, overpriced dessert and ridiculous hidden charges (we were a party of 8 and 2 of us didn't want to order anything and they wanted to charge them 1.50 each).",1
very nice dessert here .. will go with friends next time then can eat more different dessert great service,5
"desserts are mediocre and excessively sweet, not authentic at all. they mandated a policy of one minimal order per person, despite the fact that it was 10:30pm and the place was 80% empty.as a chinese person i know my food and would recommend that you go elsewhere.",1
cute and had some tasty drinks and food options. the strawberry surprise was a delight and a very interesting desert.,4
small cafe with delicious and taste desserts,4
a petite quiet internet cafe with good service and great earl gray tea! i find it very convenient for getting my thoughts together and reading. recommend it!,5
amazing place for desserts and boba tea!,5
"the entrance is somewhat hidden away, but it's worth a visit for all with a sweet tooth. it has desserts ranging from fairly ""normal"" in western countries, like fruit and ice cream, to more traditional asian desserts.",4
always my favourite place in china town. authentic taiwanese vibe that makes me absolutely nostalgic! ,5
cosy little dessert place hidden in china town.,5
"lovely gem of a cafe! lots of nice drinks and dessert options, exactly the kind of thing you'll find in asia.",5
love it.  a great place to meet up with your friends and socialise,5
average. would have been like home if they had more variety. ,4
lovely staff and music and great company,5
a great honkongese desert place neatly tucked away on a small street next to chinatown. there is no fancy storefront so it is easy to miss and i have never seen it supercrowded. the desert selection is solid and moderately priced. the staff is courteous and a bit shy. ,5
"very nice place with good staff and more important, good food.only bad thing, the seats are made of wood so not comfortable long",5
very friendly service. like others said its a small place but its quite nice and very reasonably priced!,3
"they are serve asian dessert at chinatown, high recommend their crepe, coconut soup and milk tea. small & comfortable space, friendly service and price reasonable ",4
this is chinatowns hidden dessert gem. the staff is very friendly and the selection is so huge! the desserts taste great. if you dont know what to choose try the sugo with peanut butter dumplings. the prices are more than fair.,5
cosy little cafe that serves a nice selection of sweet asian desserts. you can also pick and mix and create your own desserts with your selection of toppings. service is fast and efficient.,4
"nice bubble tea. one time i arrived just past closing time, late at night. they were still happy to serve me despite having packed a lot of things away. great attitude!",5
they have a policy for order one item per person. a place for chinese dessert.,3
"pomelo mango is very nice, must try! bubble milk tea a little too sweet, should have options for selecting the sugar level and ice level.",4
"service was really good, the staff were friendly and welcoming. the desserts were delicious! i loved the atmosphere of this cozy place.",5
small but cozy little cafe with a good selection of sweets and drinks. lively atmosphere and friendly staff.,5
"good place to have chinese dessert, and sit & chat in small or medium sized groups. but they only accept cars for one person in the group, rest us to be cash.",4
the dumpling ( with peanut in it) is super delicious!,4
"food was low quality. maybe this used to be a good place, but definitely not now. would never go back. ",1
best duck in china town,3
tamer hassan was at the next table. didn't get no aggro though. sweet.,5
easy place to go with friends or after a evening friday activity. foos is good and the price very reasonable ,4
"no frills, good food, reasonable price and very patient staff and customers (we had 4 screaming kids on the table and no one complained). just a pity they have no dessert!",5
good for a quick lunch,3
delicious food,5
a must for their soup in fact all food good,5
"no effort whatsoever in producing good dishes, all drenched in the same sauce  despite being completely different on the menu. if you don't look asian expect gloopy dishes, even if you order the real deal. spicy dishes come without a trace of chilli. did i also mention extremely rude staff? can't recommend it.",2
very good,5
a basic no drills chinese eatery handy for theatre land.  no pretensions and a decent price.,5
"unpretentious, no-frills quick food. large glasses of drinkable wine at 3.50. good pit stop before a show! ",3
"a 3.6 rating may be misleading - seems a bit low to me. the decor and presentation may not be michelin quality, but the food is certainly delicious - in addition to being an extremely economical option. would surely recommend.",4
very nice and quick,5
food was good but we had a feeling that the staff was rushing us.,2
love the place for both sit down and take away meals. ,5
not the greatest food. food came quickly but starter came after main had been served. ,3
"the worst food i've ever had in chinatown. no better than a rubbish local takeaway, bad ingredients cooked badly.they claim to have authentic handmade noodle dishes but when it comes it's dreadful, inedible. i only ate one mouthful and left the rest. go anywhere else at random and it'll be better than this.",2
fantastic food. great atmosphere. excellent service. the friendliest waiters in all of china town - maybe even london. a must for a night out with friends!,5
dandan noodle without spicy saucesichuan big bother is watching you,1
really gone downhill. food is awful now.,2
"used to be awesome, but now ownership has change and it's no longer as good. shame, but all good things... ",2
"good food, everything was fresh and tasty ....",4
"roast pork noodle soup, good stuff......enjoy",4
food is superb!,4
this place deserves 0 stars.  food is so bad i couldn't eat any of it. portion is so small i can't even see it.   it's really nasty food.  i should've gone to mcdonald's.,1
no frills but good food,5
just dont. your tummy will thank you...,1
"great bbq food & tea, comes very quickly",5
good always excellent,5
best duck in chinatown,5
"awfully bad service! we didn't get the menu at the beginning, we had to ask fot it. and the bill didn't arrive after a long time! the worst of all was that we even got the wrong dish!! would not recommend this restaurant! 0/10",1
good quality cantonese food at a great  price,5
good grub,5
delicious chinese food.,4
the best aromatic duck!,5
i've enjoyed with my family and friends awesome chinese food in london ,5
"delicious, quick, and amazing value for money. would definitely return.",5
"for last 15 years, i have been to popping in every 4 - 6 months to buy roast duck take away and the 5 spice sauce which my kids absolutely adore. went there recently and noticed restaurant had been refurbished and staff looked different. possibly new management. the roast duck and 5 spice sauce were tasteless and very disappointing.",2
"needs new menus. otherwise pretty decent. roast duck, bbq and crispy belly pork on plain rice is good",3
an average experience in culinary excellence,3
"love this place, been coming for years. great food, generous portion sizes, fantastic value for money.",5
good flavours not too salty or oily. feels tad expensive? friendly staff and quick service compared to many other restaurants in chinatown.,4
basic but good,4
"food was okay but the staff were awful, particularly the small woman. we ordered different dishes but we got everything the same, and when we asked them if they were different, they tried to ignore us.",1
"good place for chinese roast meat, crispy duck and stir fried dishes. friendly staff",4
really bad customer service. we ordered two different noodles but was served the same thing. the waitress didn't even give us a proper answer when we asked her. wouldn't recommend this place.,1
the place is quite small and cramps. staffs are friendly. food that we ordered mostly very delicious except the last dish which was sio long poa were a disaster. unable to eat at all.,3
great duck and noodles were awesome,4
one of my favourite chinese restaurants in chinatown. very affordable yet good quality. extremely reliable.  staff (almost) friendly. ;-),5
this was the worst food i've eaten in any restaurant. it was tasteless and expensive. service and hygiene was poor. we would never have eaten here unless a website said it.,1
"by far the worst dumplings ive ever had. asked for the 10 grilled vegetarian dumplings, got 7 steamed dumplings. they took it back and clearly grilled the steamed dumplings so they were rubbery (as there was still only 7). then took a bite and the filling looked, spelt and tasted like pork but they kept assuring me it was vegetarian.",1
"delicious food and friendly, quick service in reasonably decorated place close to leicester square. we had the set menu b for 2 people with extra chicken satay strips and it was spot on... if a little spicy! ignore the negative reviews but just check they take bank cards as you arrive. i would definitely go back again!",4
chinese. food. good. what else? the duck was juicy and crispy? go and see for yourself.,5
what happened to this place? i used to live round the corner and the food was reliably decent and reasonably priced. i went back today and the food was completely different - poor quality and a tiny portion and the price had increased by 30% to 3 years ago... i wont be going back. avoid :-(,1
roast duck is one of the best in soho but the prices have become a little steep. may explain why we managed to walk in and get a table on a friday night!,4
i had the mixed lo mein and it was amazing!!! i also had the spare ribs and shanghai steam buns and they were equally as amazing!!!! definitely recommend this place!! hella good!,5
staff was very helpful  and good food especially the duck rice,5
"generally go here when i'm around the area on business and need a quick lunch. speedy, dependable, and offering the cantonese classics i can't get near me. definitely recommended if you need a quick lunch service with reasonable prices.",4
"tourist trap dont go there, expensive and poor food",1
nice food and cozy place,4
the quality of the food has gone down since the refurb of the restaurant. shame really!,3
"excellent bubblewaffle and service, loved it",5
simply. fantastic .. an old establishment that kept its level of good food,5
"food was poor, ambience even worse and cold. there are better places in chinatown!",2
"in the middle of the heart of chinatown, an authentic chinese food. good place for an hangout",4
"superb, i've been coming here for the past 25 years and it's still the only chinese i visit in chinatown. crispy duck, shredded beef  lovely.",5
my wife loved it great food good service,4
good quality local chinese take away. very reasonable on prices and the food is clean. provides a quick turnaround so you don't have to wait like other takeaways.,5
friendly staff and nice food.,4
i've been going to canton for over 20 years. always good food and fast service.,5
i've been going to this restaurant since i was a kid. it has been a family favourite for many many years now. it can be a bit cramped sometimes but just think of it as part of the charm. the food is great!!,5
horrible experience. never in my life that go to a restaurant served cool roast duck. the customer service is really bad as well.,1
"it was okay, not spectacular.",3
"we went there for bubble tea and it was amazing! good price, friendly staff and great tea!",5
service is quite slow and not too friendly staff. overall classic milk tea was okay but not outstanding.,3
nice drinks but use a lot of plastic and overpriced,3
brown sugar milk tea is a bit too sweet (can't adjust the sugar) but good and taro is a good classic. i stop by every time i'm in london.,4
too slow 20 minutes waiting after ordered .... and error on my order.,1
"really long queue only for an incorrect order. when i told them it was wrong, the manager of the shift got upset at me. so many great places on this street - just choose a different one across the way.",1
my favorite bubbletea,5
"today i ordered one taro milk bubble tea and  brown sugar milk tea. the brown sugar is super super sweet, but i know some shops put too much brown sugar on it...but the taro milk tea was unacceptable...the colour of taro drink was not purple, but light brown...and the taste was awful...i really not recommend to anyone...",1
i love their bubble tea! i've taken some of my travelling malay friends here and they've enjoyed it too. service is really friendly and patient. only downside is i never know if i need cash or not; sometimes they take card and sometimes they don't.,4
tea latte with fresh milk,4
"long queue and not worth it. doesn't taste anything better.  asked for regular sweetness and it was super sweet, i ended it throwing it away.",1
great stop off for some bible tea. watch out for the wonky table ,5
"long queue but very nice milk bubble tea. they could do with a better and more organised ordering system, but we will be coming back here.",4
"my niece told me about ""bubble tea"" and bought one from here. she likes it a lot!",4
good bubble teas~,4
i always go chat time whenever i go london since back at my town we don't have it. it always taste great and never disappoints with a variety of flavours to choose.,5
"we've been at this place in vancouver, toronto, la, miami, singapore, jakarta, and now london. they have all been pretty consistent in taste and quality. best place to go to wherever they are at if you are craving bubble tea.",4
"very poor service! you ask for tea with no ice and you get with ice! once you realise and want to replace it, you get horrible response! basically, i had a very unpleasant experience more than twice in that place and thus not because of of their products it's because of the staff treating customers unfairly. such a shame!",1
"my bubble tea tasted like fish sadly, the tapioca pearls were great but could not out do the taste and fishy smell of the tea. i have tried the peach green tea flavor and am unsatisfied.",1
great bubble tea! however very inefficient with orders. took half an hour to get my order. the big reason it's always busy is because they move slow!,3
"love this store. staff was very friendly, the bubble tea here was soo delish :).  my new regular bubble tea store.",5
"i would recommend everyone to try this amazing bubbly tee from taiwan. i've been there for the first time, service was fast, tea was superb and for reasonable prices.",5
decent bubble tea not the best but it's okay,4
"nice and authentic. the foam drink was too sweet though. you can get their online app, order it and just collect it there. however, they forgot my order so we waited for a while. they were very busy so i understand but we waited for like 40 mins.",4
"was served by a young girl called ruby, such a lovely girl! i was so pleased by her amazing customer service and she really made my day. great girl! great service!",5
this is the most popular bubble tea joint which has all the collaboration tea's like hello kitty's. for me too much sugar - make sure you get low sugar if you're over 13,4
very friendly staff.  we left our shopping there accidentally and they saved it for us.  great tea and super design.,5
"even though it was a busy day, drinks were made quickly but still really well. definitely will be going back soon.",5
one of the best bubble tea you can get in london!,5
"friendly staff, tasty bubble tea",5
one of the best places to get various flavours of boba. love it!,5
my families trip to chinatown is never complete without a boba from chatime. you could say it's tradition - lol  they almways make quality milktea,5
good place for bubble tea and i would say still the best of amongst all the other places. the queues are very long though as it does get very crowded and the staff struggles to keep up with orders so minus point for that.,4
nice atmosphere with an amazing selection of beverages,5
affordable price and good quality drink,5
nice options but the service is without a smile. looks like some forced labour people are working,2
really liked the lemon cooler.,4
quite a popular place in chinatown.,5
great tea and consistent service every time a++,5
amazing chai and bubble teas. i loved the black sugar pearl tea.,5
"young girl on the till today was incredibly rude and condescending today. left bad taste in the mouth, pardon the pun. taste of the bubble tea was below average as usual form this branch.",1
"terrible customer service!!! they were very rude when i asked about certain flavours (like i would know the difference between your 3 different honeymelon drinks) and got evil, angry-face stares towards myself and our kids. this is not a kid-friendly place. there are other boba places better than this. it's chinatown!",1
great service and amazing products!,5
average taiwan bubble tea,4
very good! ,5
the taste is getting worse,3
nicely made tea.,4
nice bubble tea place,5
nice bubble tea.,4
really good bubble tea,5
interesting drinks worth a try,4
chatime more like shatime,2
nice tea,5
best bubble tea in chinatown but always has crazy long queues. ,5
love the roasted milk tea,5
good for all bubble tea lovers!,5
very poor service attitude,1
over rated,2
usually very packed but quick service.,4
a great place to get a nice taiwanese drink! ,5
it was good. too bad they don't have seating area.,4
"waits can be long and ridiculously expensive, but good quality tea",3
this chatime has pictures of drinks with grass jelly... but never actually has grass jelly,1
awesome stuff,5
their people just don't know how to smilevery unfriendly,1
terrible service and hard tapioca pearls,1
really tasty but there was a long queue ,5
"we asked 3 things on the menu, they didn't have them and answered rudely. i'm sure i won't visit again. ",1
good shop,4
bad experience. my bubble tea wasn't mixed well. they didn't accept card payments which is unusual in this day and age. won't come back any time soon.,2
serves the bubble tea cravings. pretty standard though here,3
takes too long time to get a cup of milk tea,3
great drinks ,4
average bubble tea,2
basic bubble tea outlet. pretty smooth operations and very centrally located in chinatown. a lot of options so read the menu before queueing up. the queue moves quickly and you don't want to be holding up others. you can get in and out of here in 10 minutes.,3
noice,5
good tea,5
bubble tea shop,2
very fresh,5
why they like to change the order instruction by them own?,1
a wide selection of bubble tea and always tastes great but when busy it can get a bit to crowded.,3
staffs are extremely rude. the drinks are just ok. definitely don't recommend it to anyone.,1
"staff was so rude! the customer service is soooo poor, they speak their own language with rude facial expression in front of their customer.",1
"apart from the service, i would really recommend the second bubble tea listed there(oops! forgot the name) but tastes so nice!",5
decent bubble tea. but the place is often crowded,3
a group of snobbish and rude hong kong shop assistants. they do not know what 'service' is. terribly made taro milk tea which is with disgustingly sweet flavour and impossible to drink. we threw it into the dust bin.,1
"peach milk tea with tapioca pearles - lovely! .. a refreshing change from drinking normal leaf tea. plenty of choice here, massive queues during the weekend",3
"the customer service was very bad. i ordered my drink and only changed the ice option before paying and then the cashier throws my ticket on the table. my hand was out to receive it, but clearly she didn't like me...the drink selections are good, but maybe can have a list of recommendations to help with selecting something new.",1
"avoid - i feel sorry for the employees, but since the recipes were changed back in 2014, there's no point coming here (drinks watered down). this place is usually packed due to the location, and is horribly stuffy.",1
tapioca pearls weren't cooked properly and terrible service,1
one of the best bubble tea in london,5
loooove the peach milk tea boba!,5
loved it! ,5
yummy!,5
"love the drinks in here, they are great and so was the service. i dont get the negative reviews, my experience here has been very good. love the bubble tea....",5
real real real bad service. staff made so many mistakes when ordering. and she did not admit,1
"the first time i tried bubble tea was here, and it was okay. i thought it was just too sugary for me towards the end!",5
"chatime is the best time , great drinks , hot and cold ....love those pearls...",5
bubble tea in china town existed long before this cafe but this cafe brought in the punters... worth going in and finding a drink but since its opening there's been many more and some i might say are doing it better...,3
lovely place to pick up a bubble milk tea however it can get extremely busy at times especially at the weekends. the price is ok for london and the drink themselves is fairly average.,3
"a large bubble tea franchise. as my initial description states it, the quality and consistency is just not to the level i would except from a large and experienced company.",3
"extensive menu, chaotic queuing, great tea.",3
great place to get bubble tea,5
"coming from canada, and already in the midst of experiencing the obvious difference in drinks - we were pleasantly surprised by the familiarity of the drinks from this chatime and the one back home.unfortunately the drink selection was a bit lacking and tapioca pearls a bit hard and flavourless for our liking.",3
"love this place, nice staff and great service! the only problem is the massive queue all the time but that just proves how great this place is!",5
"rude staff, and drinks are never consistent. plus this chatime only give a regular drink on the free drink stamp which the other chatimes will do a large drink. always busy and not worth the wait.",1
feels like literally the only bubble tea place in europe. efficient but get in before they run out of yam.,5
good bubble tea!,4
"always a line when i come here. however, its quick service and i never have to wait too long. best bubble tea on the block.",5
loved the tea!,5
"a relatively crowded branch, but still nice flavor~",4
i have been to several chatime from manchester to london and got the worst experience here because of a very impatient and rude employee who deserves zero star.,1
coco is better.,2
i always come back for more! worth the long queues.,5
i swung by when i saw an opportunity when it was the least busy. ordered a jasmine milk tea and got my drink quickly. might have been a fluke but my milk tea lacked jasmine flavor. i'd try it again the next time i'm in the country. ,3
just not very good,1
rude staffs. repeated my order twice to this chinese girl staff and still order my drink wrongly. asked for exchange and she said repeated my order to me in poor english yet ignoring me a very bad attitude. ,1
queue was very long. product was similar to other tea places.,3
just rude.,1
a lot of the popular drinks had run out so there was not much choice available however service was good and quick,4
"the queues can get really long here, which is weird because imo its not the best place for milk tea- even in chinatown.",3
"long queues always,but nice bubble tea.",3
"good place for bubble tea but unfortunately they tend to run out of stock very frequently. last couple of times i have been they didn't have pearls,  or only had 1 flavour left! ",3
it's nice that they started accepting card payments. best milk tea around! can get busy at times tho,5
extremely rude staff. glared at me for no reason whatsoever. what's wrong with them? bubble tea is just okay. definitely don't recommend here to anyone.,1
great service i hope they dont discontinue the stamp cards in favour of their annoying app,5
"great staff, great choice grear drink. if you've never had bubble tea before this is a great place to go for your  first time.",5
"lovely day , topped up with lovely food.x",5
bad slow service.,1
extremely rude workers! i dont know what happened to those workers that make them cant speak politely to customers. they even threw the changes to the customer in front of us. really really rude! i would never go there again ,1
not only give the wrong size but the wrong item!,1
"the service is really good and friendly and although the place gets busy quite often, the line is fast. also, the drinks are amazing. favourite: chocolate milk tea",5
average level in asian but famous in london,3
yummy bubble tea,4
very nice,5
not a fan of the tea here,2
the best bubble tea in chinatown and perhaps the most underrated. it has a richer tea taste than its rival biju. try the roasted milk bubble tea with grass jelly and pudding topping! ,5
awesome bubble tea place! :d,5
this place is so busy all the time but that's why the pearls are consistently fresh and chewy :),5
the classic chatime milk tea is always a favourite in this place. fast and friendly service.,5
great selection of bubble milk teas but they stopped serving coffee jelly....what gives?,2
fast serving tea. if you are in hurry you should visit here. you can get your drink less than 3 mins,5
queue is often very long and the staff is not very friendly. the drinks tastes good but definitely not the best for their price range.,4
extremely bad services! would never go there again!,1
classic bubble tea - really popular with people from outside the uk. impressed by customisation of the tea,5
one of the best milktea in london. despite the long que during afternoon everything is great!,5
delicious food from a comprehensive menu. friendly staff. waitress enquired about food allergies etc  enjoyable experience in a cafe style atmosphere.,4
staple bubble tea place,4
taro milk tea was way too bland and diluted. bad customer service.,1
amazing bubble tea. great variety of options.,5
fine bubble tea. queue is way too long,3
great bubble tea...what more can i say!@,4
"as a taiwanese, i would say their bubble tea is the most authentic ones you can get in london. though the queue is crazy and it's not exactly cheap either. ",5
"bubble tea! if you like it, or its variations with different fruits, milk or anything else. a small and cosy place, service was quick enough even with the line here.",4
"a nice bubble tea and the most tea tasting one from the shops around. a good place, a shame that it is cash only. ",4
"awesome, yum!",5
worst bubble tea i ever had... but i give 2 because my friend liked it.,2
bubble tea here tastes great with loads of options at reasonable prices. my only complaint is that often they sell out from the different flavours which leaves limited options for your order. ,4
one of the most well known bubble tea chains worldwide. there is always a queue here as they are quite slow in brewing but the taste is always consistent ,4
nice drink but very small and long waiting.,4
rude staff and always in a rush to close up.,2
staffs need to be more polite and patient.,2
lively and lovely place to select bubble tea- a speciality in taiwan. choose ur own flavour drink and decide whether you want pearl bubble or grass jelly! ,4
"pretty disgusting, they use water to dilute drinks just to fill the cup instead of adding more of the base",2
excellent boba in the entrance to chinatown. a classic joint.,5
a proper taiwanese bubble tea cafe. authentic in taste and variety. unpretentious. ,4
pearls always taste great compared to the other nearby bubble tea shops. the milk tea is pretty decent too. ,5
i keep going there again and again for a reason.,5
a place that u can meet famous people. not to expensive however only 60 min session,4
excellent centrally located venue,4
nice place,5
wonderful mix of guests in a cool place,5
friendliest venue,5
beautiful well managed venue. always pop in when passing to see  what is going on in this exciting becon of chinese culture 10/10,5
very grand and beautiful,4
central location and friendly stuffs,5
excellent talks at the china exchange - do check them out,5
ok place for events in the heart of chinatown,4
"a brilliant venue run by brilliant people! amazing events, exhibitions, talks and activities. i adore coming here!",5
must visit when in chinatown london,5
"i discovered this little gem on a photowalk with london_only (check their instagram page )this is a charity aiming to get people to discover chinese rich culture. often organising events, some of them for freethis weekend there is a free photo exhibition from chinese new year.tickets are available from their page",5
been to some of their cultural events and always received a warm welcome.,5
"it's a middle to high level venue for any form of gathering such as meetings, conferences and seminars. have a friendly environment ease of access.",4
small  but friendly place. interesting to meet new people with different cultural points of view.,4
a venue right in the middle of chinatown,4
a good location to host an event of up to 60 people in the middle of china town.,4
"i'm not really sure what the china exchange is but we had a good time there! jdrf had booked it as a warm-down venue for runners after the london marathon so there was a great bunch of people there, sharing experiences and eating great food.",4
very good for all parties,3
great location and resource with very useful events.,5
great space in the big city,5
"delicious, well priced",4
butter chocolate biscuits...nothing like you have ever had. i buy a packet every single week. expensive: 4.20 for around 13-15 biscuits but definitely worth it. their cakes are fluffy and have a great balance of sweetness and savoury.,4
decent and really interesting pastries. my favourite place to go for cakes in chinatown.,5
a no-nonsense self-serving bakery where they have sweets made of beans and you can buy them for pocket change. what more can you ask for in life?,5
decent chinese bakery but wouldn't say it's the best. feel a bit touristy.,3
probably one of my favourite places in london and definitely my favourite bakery. great selection and decent prices and there's always something new to try. the staff is very efficient and everything is delicious. you should note that purchases under 10 have to be paid in cash.,5
"absolutely gorgeous bakery. the bread and buns are delicious. enough choices to grab some food for traveling.they don't accept amex, but most other cards are accepted. minimum 10.",5
"this bakery truly is a gem in london! it has variery of pastry choices and prices are more than reasionable. i would strongly recommend the wife cakes, egg tarts, coconut buns and the mooncakes. the only downside is unfriendly staff, but i get it, this place is always crowded and it's probably hard to keep up with that pace",4
fantastic range of delicious cakes!,5
love the egg tart and coconut bread so much!,5
"nice place, nice people and fabulous food. mmmm the little carps and their creamy filling, as well as the rolls, freshly made, efficient and fast service. better taste than those on the other side of chinatown.",5
amazing quality and value.,5
very good selection of asian bakery products,5
"very tasty buns, go here often when in london",5
great variety of sweet and savory bakes! excellent celebrations cakes,4
amazing selection of baked chinese snacks. love the pork buns. had the cream and peanut bun for thr first time today and it was delicious. great value for money too,5
pricey and bad hygiene. it's not very clear on what's what because the labels are crammed all together. the lady is way to tired and there's no rapport being build. they seem to be traditional baked goods but it doesn't have a great energy,2
favourite chinese bakery in london.  their egg tarts are fantastic and the buns are buttery and soft!  mochi balls with peanut have a lot of peanuts so those are a favourite as well!,5
they have all sorts of yummy cakes and savory treats,5
cute self service bakery offering very affordable oriental pastries and cakes. the mini custard taiyaki are delicious as are the bbq pork buns and custard buns. it can get very crowded and difficult to navigate but the store recently expanded to double the size.,5
"i'd keep going back for the taiyaki alone, but the bakery items are also good",5
"great cakes at great prices. i recommend the huge, light, and fluffy pandan cake (or anything else that takes your fancy, they are all tasty)",5
i go here every time i go to london and the food is amazing (i really like the sausage in a bun),5
love the custard fish and pandan cake,5
very yummy breads. taste of home.,5
"amazing, absolutely affordable prices. anything below 10 will need to pay by cash. i recommend the vanilla chiffon sandwich and fishes filled with custard!",5
great cakes and pastries but staff are so damn miserable and rude!,5
staff members can be a bit rude/unfriendly but i don't come here for pleasantries. bread is a lovely reminder of growing up in hong kong. extremely busy and they do say to watch out for pick pockets.,5
good selection of cakes etc. price is reasonable.  food is freshly baked. taste good. if using credit card you need to spend at least 10 otherwise cash.staff are ok. typical chinatown staff attitude.  they are friendly tourist but can be rude to the locals.i would say this is one of the bette bakeries in the chinatown area.,4
"always visit this cake shop when in london,  the cakes are of the finest you will find",5
taiyaki fish matcha ice-cream is so yummy. only 4 for a big dessert meal.,5
great selection of bakery. always busy,4
best egg tarts i've ever had.,5
the staff was awful. therefore their food wasnt cooked properly . never try this place,1
very authentic bakery!,5

"rude staff, gave me the wrong change but didn't even apologize ",1
wide selection of delicious pastries.,5
you have to try the waffles fish!,5

best bakery in chinatown,5
quality,5
nice buns ,4
great taiyaki! closed a little early but good desert after dinner.,5
bakery has a lot of great stuff! recommend!,5
great place to have a quick bite,5
"very messy bakery , you dont know where is the line ? the cashier dropped my cake in the paper bag on the floor & was asking me if i still want it ... allo gurl of course i need a new one and she did with no smile bye i will never return to this awful shop next ! cakes are not so good compared to hong kong",2
very rude girl working at the cashier and seems she doesnt like her job may be!!,1
now with the extension looks even bigger and better. staff could be a little more accommodating though :),5
unique and tasty chinese pastry.,5
yami,5
heavenly pork bread buns.,4
very special and tasty! every time worth it for a visit!,5
a good selection of flavoured buns and cakes ,3
delicious food.,5
chinatown's best-kept secret. you *have* to sample everything in that bakery,5
great stop for some fast food pastries on your way to the theatre. sweet and savory. ,4
yum! so tasty and lots of choice,5
very nice selection of sweet and savery buns there. it can be a bit crammed at times but it is typical hong kong style so love it even more.,5
excellent selection of chinese bakery classics and they are done well.,5
nice selection of sweet and savoury chinese baked goods nice custard tarts,4
"my favourite chinese bakery! i like the pork bun, pandan chiffon cake and custard bun. taiyaki also lovely though a bit expensive imo. ",5
it's cute but it's meh. but it's cute.,4
"so good for fresh, hot baked goods.",5
great food with a quick service ,5

"try fish shape cake, it is yummy ",4
"lots of choice, cheap and all tastes fresh and good! ",5
good buns.,4
nice fresh soft rolls,4
unique desserts for a cheap price,5
"great little china town bakery serving plenty of authentic hong kong classics such as pork floss buns, red bean buns and pineapple buns. having visited hong kong many times the standard here is pretty close to hk. freindly staff willing to recommend of you are unsure. the pineapple buns are especially good. recommended",4
good fresh food here and simon always happy to help.,5
serving great breads and cookies,5
i always stop by this place when im in london for some chinese baked goods!,5
i bought these on sunday evening and this is what happens monday,1
delicious pastry!!,5
"fantastic bakery with so much to try. it's cash only for under 10 so make sure you have some before trying to pay, also it's a small store so can feel busy even when there is only a few people inside.",5
i absolutely love the freshly made fish!!! just watching it being baked is fun. sweet buns you can't buy anywhere else. definitely a must when visiting chinatown in london.,5
my favourite place for bakeries when in chinatown,5
so tasty,5
nice verity of cakes,4
i love this place!! nothing has ever let me down.,5
"chinatown important key bakery. grateful it is always good. watch the machine in the window, perfect pastries and you can pay with a card if 10  minimum spend.",5
awful customer sevice experience. i asked for a bag to put my purchase and they told me to use the tray without paper... i replied why they didn't want to give the bag and told use the tray they are clean which obviously you don't know. the products are good but they should review their customer service.,1
this place has so many good deserts and savoury options. the custard filled fish made fresh to order and to do for as well as all the red bean filled deserts. i really like the pork buns and custard buns. as you can guess i've been here a few times so hopefully that is enough of a recommendation,5
a good selection of baked goods at reasonable prices. definitely worth a visit if you're in chinatown.,5
"i love their fluffy cupcake, very light and not too sweet i can easily eat 2 and not feel guilty:) they have a nice selection of sweet and meal type bread. dont forget to carry cash.",5
"bought the vanilla taiyaki, but was let down by a sour soft serve ice cream. spoke to the staff who dismissed it, who tried a fresh batch and said it was fine. they refused a replacement or refund. would never buy from here again, would recommend wonderful patisserie round the corner. far better.",1
"their buns are really great. it is better then what i expected.  the chicken floss bun is moist but not dry and the bread itself is fluffy but will fill you up. can't complain the taste. the only downside is i can only buy them in london chinatown, which i can stock too many everytime.",5
"all your favourites. fresh and delicious.very popular. buns and pastry are quite large.self-service (as you will have a tray in one hand and tongs in the other, beware of pickpockets when it is very crowded; such is life in the metropolis).",4
"love this bakery! the buns here are fabulous and there's a large choice of different cakes, buns and other baked goods. well worth a visit, but be aware it's usually pretty busy and is a tight squeeze as the store is small.",5
expensive but worthy,5
"the taiyaki are a real treat. the cooking mechanism is very interesting to watch while waiting for three treats. but mind you, if they are just baked, the custard inside is extremely hot. be patient and then carefully enjoy.",4
i love it!,5
fresh fish shaped pancake bites are rather delicious,5
very tasty and fresh,5
"this little shop of heavenly foods is awesome, especially the sticky pork buns. if you can wait till they do a fresh batch , it will be totally worth it as they melt in your mouth.",5
brilliant chinese desserts,5
"the bakery has a tradition feel, as well as delivering high quality products. however high priced for amount received. also there should be some redevelopment to expand as the store is too small to capacitate large amount of people.",4
a great selection of chinese cakes - we visit every time we are near china town!,4
"good chinese pastry. i'm now munching on a peanut cake, yummy",5
delicious soft ice cream but the price is a little bit expensive.,4
"so good, classic chinese bakery ! worth trying",5
"if you are into customer service, this is not the place for you. there are no niceties from the staff, but the everything in here is absolutely delicious and a must try if you are around chinatown!",5
"amazing set of cakes and fish shaped custard filled sweets in the window. great if you like pandas, moon cakes, coconut or asian cakes in general.",5
worth a visit to watch them make these delicious fish shaped cakes filled with (very hot) custard. children love peering in the window watching them cook... dont forget to buy a bag!,5
a good selection of baked treats.,5
love the choice of rolls here: kaya and red bean being one of my favourite. only downside is that they only accept cards with payments over 10.,4
"really bad customer service, avoid",1
my usual go to bakery place in chinatown. this time i got some egg tarts as well in addition to my usual buns. both were fresh and delicious. can't go wrong getting baked goods from here.,5

decent asian local bakery taste. soft breads and cute cakes,5
"a true taste of hong kong, in food and prices too!",5
"cheap and cheerful, a great place to grab a snack. ",4
nice chinese bakery,5

nice selection of cakes and pastries. minimum 10 pound card payment,5
"lovely little bakery in china town. its quite popular with the locals and tourists alike. lots a different treats to choose from all with an authentic chinese taste. items are also reasonably priced. only issue is that if your purchase is less then 10, you will have to pay with cash.",4
"we've been here to buy birthday cakes for friends a couple of times, we love the cakes here. we also buy most of the other products at various points through the year. probably my favourite chinese bakery in uk. ",4
tasty treats,5
very cheap chinese bakery with a good selection of sweet and savoury buns. they have japanese fish cakes with sweet bean or nutella and some pretty decent coconut buns. the queue was long but it moved quickly.,4
"you can smell the taiyaki from around the corner.very busy, self service bakery. simple chinese bakery delights - great for a snack or a little treat.",4
an asian-styled bakery shop located in the china town. suit for pople who wanna escape from a british bakery selling in the supermarket. my favourite goes for the shreded pork bun. the price is reasonable as the portion size is enough for a meal.,5
best pork bun. a man who doesn't eat pork bun is never a whole man.,5
such amazing baked goods. will definitely be re-visiting and taking friends,5
"yummy! that's all i can say. visit, try some and enjoy. the cakes are not as sweet as you might expect.",5
love this place! it's my favourite chinese bakery,5
"this is one of the most over rated places! staff is incredibly rude! with this attitude the only reason to be still in business is the top tourist location. top tip: be nice to your customers, they came in to give you their money!",1
it was ok. slighly chaotic and quite expensive. there are better alternatives around.,3
"great selection and fair prices. the buns taste amazing. the staff were very friendly, too!",5
mmmmmm,5
good quality and i would go back again.,5
they produce those kinds of bread and buns which my grandmother bought me when i was in kindergarten.  they are rare in china now and i couldn't believe i found them here now.,4
"super authentic and decently priced baked goods. you'll be stoked with anything you buy there. i especially loved the ""burrito"" looking pastry on the right. it is filled with a red bean paste and when warmed up, the best thing in the entire world. ",5
very very crowded. pastries are delicious but not the best. price is affordable,4
fun bakery. tasty cakes.,5
love this place! i have chinese inlaws and our nan tuned 100! so i suprise her with a beautiful selection from this bakery!,5
best place for peoper chinese baked good.,5
watch you cakes being made but be careful as. they are very hot in the middle,4
"love this place, always go there whenever im near by. if theres one thing you need to try is the pandan cake... literally the most soft cloud like sponge cake ever. also the prices are so very cheap.",5
"cheap, delicious, fresh. good variety of sweet and savoury",5
always come here for bread but it's always jammed with people so be careful of your belongings!,5
"such a finding in central london, very cheap but very good! had some taiyaki (fish shaped cream cake) and then had to go back the other day to grab some more salty and sweet treats! the smell on the street really pulls you in.",5
"amazing buns and baked goodies. got a chicken curry bun, and a few others things i had never tried before and they were all incredible. such a treat and really affordable.",5
fresh bakery.,4
we come here every time we visit china town and are always impressed with the quality and taste of the food.,4
"one of the best patisseries in london, cream buns are the best",5
"lovely chinese bakery, can't go wrong, best you can get in central london",5
my favourite place in chinatown,5

chinatown ist very small but still good enough for a short walk,5
lots of great chinese foods here. get nice roasted meats here!,5
"ok important thing to remember. a great chinese restaurant will have chinese people eating it and staff will a bit moody, and it will look a bit on the grubby side, there will be chicken feet and cold jelly fish and offer very non western meat. do not be afraid to ask the waiter what the chinese people are eating and order that.",4
traditional..tasty smells..but lot lots of tourists,4
food nice but service need improvement,3
small but the overall food quality is acceptable.,3

"plenty of chinese food options. the place is nicely decorated at the evening times and a lot of street artists perform every day. many of the restaurants in this area offer all you can eat option in around 11-15 price range. however some of them are cash only, so preferable to carry some cash.",5
chinatown is my favourite spot in london. its always full of buskers and you can spend a beautiful day while enjoying a delicious asian dish.,5
amazing place! one of the best views i  have ever seen in the uk! worth the visit absolutely.,4

beautiful atmosphere we visited right before the chinese new year and everything was full with lanterns.you can find a few good stores and restorants but sadly it's easy to pick a really bad place if you don't read reviews before hand,4
wonderful. we really enjoyed our experience there. being there at christmas time just add to the vibe.,5
when in london it's a must to visit chinatown to get a taste of best in asian culinary. from the famous four seasons to the other similarly great chinese restaurants. try the roast ducks and roast meats.,4
it really is like how you would see in the movies of chine town. they have the traditional chinese red lanterns hanging everywhere. red and golden gates. there is just a amazing range of decorations and dragon statues at every corner. this was a great place to take tons of pics and it is very strange to think this is in central london.,5

"vibrant chinese community is london. thumbs up especially to wan chai corner. great service, great food and reasonable prices. highly recommended when you are in london",5
it's a standard chinatown gate that you can see in most cities with a chinatown so far as i'm aware.  it's no better or worse than any other.  once you've seen one..,3
i really enjoyed being here with my best friend. we got bubble waffles and they were delicious! don't come to europe for chinese food or you'll be disappointed,4

always it's full of people but is a nice place,5
crowded place as always. lively.,4
good quality chinese restaurants with food reasonably-priced.,4
"an unexpected enjoyment. i wasn't planning on visiting chinatown, but had extra time and decided to do a walk about. i was able to catch a aerial show and clear sky. i do recommend this district if your looking for affordable dishes and fun street entertainment.",4
nice as a passing tourist attraction for a photo or two but nothing majorly special,3
"nice area, plenty of restaurants around",5
great place to eat with lots of choices x,5
"great place to eat if you like chinese food.many places with all you can eat food. with lots of choices.prices are so,so depends with what you compare....",5
good food court for authentic chinese food lovers.,4
nice place to visit for chinese shops and restaurants,5
only thing worth getting for me was the food. it's dirty here and overcrowded.,2
"usaual eat all for one prices, reasonable chioce of food, no duck on menu, food was warm, and pre cooked, not ideal for romantic diner, not intermite.",3
i love london china town!,5
chinese food in abundance...this is where you can absolutely get it all..from dumplings and etc.,5
fantastic. while there you must go into one of the restaurants. chinese will never taste the same again!,5
love china town in london!!,5
chinatown in the heart of the west end is found between leicester square & picadilly cirus. it's also home to one of the best bubble wrap dessert shops in london.. not to mention all the chinese traditional restaurants. a great place to go when you're hungry!,4
a must visit place while in london... a little china town.. great for the sent of chinese foods...,4

a great tourist location!,5
"always love to visit china town when in that part of london, especially the bakery shop. fully recommended.",5
very nice lmao,5
good place to have a good food...,5
a must visit place to see the chinese culture in centre of london.,5
the one and only one.,4
china town... its  a gap from the normal london vibe and goes suddenly to a different scenario where chinese styled streets and chinese restaurants are all that this place has to offer which is great for the tourists and also a change of scenery for the locals. great part of town.,5
recently there have been a lot of new & interesting restaurants and eateries.,5
nice snacks and nice people,5
"was sooo happy to find the ""chinese pancake"" i had in shanghai! and only costs 4 ",5
good value for money,5
thanks for the real chinese street food!!!,5
cheap and delicious. my fav secret spot.,5
authentic and super affordable <3,5
tasty and fast,5
delicious!,4
chinese tapas,5
cool,5
went here to try the jianbing. the place didn't look very clean or hyginic in my opinion. the pork that went into our jianbing was taken from a plastic unrefrigerated container.the jianbing was nothing to shout about. needed more crispy to soft contrast and there wasn't much flavour. didn't eat it all.,2
great  (chinese savory pancakes). soy milk is also great. prices are reasonable. ,5
lovely,3
"looks like several people posting 1-star reviews are doing so, if only as a means to vent their racist opinions of chinese people.",4
the food was delicious and cheap.,4
"i come from china, never thought i can have so good chinese foods here!!!",5
lovely food,5
good food,4
good food fills the gap value for money.,3
"interesting food, bad attitude staff",3
very authentic chinese street food! very delicious foods with reasonable price. highly recommend this place to anyone!,5
"special food, never had before. quite tasty. if you like new ting, worth to come and try.",5
this place is small but should not be underestimated. they do fantastic savoury chinese crepes and i recommend this to be tried by anyone! i usually order with just the number from the menu and always go with number 5!it's not pretentious in any way and just offers great food.,5
"delighted bubble tea has come to china town. i'm there a few times a week it's that good! friendly service, great menu and a real different offering to london. please market yourselves and show everyone what you've got!",5
"quite like tapas, but never tried chinese tapas before. passing by this little shop and decided to try one. i would say its a totally different taste but nice tasty. and its quite big made me really full. will come back and try other things on the menu.",5
"we really liked this chinese tapas house, the food was lovely and we will definitely come back again. also the service is basic but good.well done!!",5

well priced authentic food and fast service,5
not so bad,3
"good food , good people",5
don't eat buns. they aren't cooked enough. the inside doesn't taste good or is awfullml. the worst one is with vegetable. i haven't tried other products.,1
it's a very traditional cultural & very good quality,3
good choice of food. nicely cooked. reasonable prices.,4
lovely place with lovely staff,5
"a nice authentic chinese place that serves some very good tasty food. loses a few stars as the vegetarian choice was lacking otherwise, worth a visit.",3
"food was late, server was rude about it and got overly frustrated when we asked to split the bill. would not recommend.",1
"everytime i come to china town, i always stop here. the 2 steamed vegetable buns are seriously good. the 3 mango bubble tea is also great! i get these two every time :-) quick service, cheap, good food, perfect for a quick meal during or after a night out",5
"nasty food, they dont seem professional with food hygeine. stupid and annoying service. wouldnt recommend to others and definitely wont come back.",1
"authentic street food, love it",4
my friend and i felt that this is one of the best chinese take away we had. fresh and tasty and the service was excellent. nothing was a problem and we the thoroughly enjoyed it. i would travel to central london for this restaurant .,5
simply excellent. try number 4.,5
"this is one of those delicious hole in the wall places, i had the chinese crepe with belly pork, which tasted awesome and quite filling. no it's not the cleanest place but you don't go here for the 5* dining experience but for the authentic chinese street food. good if you're in the area looking for a tasty bite.",5
"it is a good concept of selling, specialising buns that are tasty and convenient - the original concept of fast food, before mcdonald, kfc, etc. cooked/steamed until they are sold and consumed.if youre find yourself in the area and want to try something new, you wont be disappointed.i will definitely will go back.",5
small chinese street food shop. tasty food. ,5
very nice place... will visit again!,5
tasty and quick,4
these are the real chinese street foods. i love it so much!!!,5
"fills you up and is so delicious, perfect hand held food for walking around the area.",5
really average food and the bubble tea was miserable. one thing i cannot tolerate is when the bubbles are too hard. they obviously left out the bubble way too long.,2
"great  and beijing snacks. but the bubble tea's bubbles were not fresh, ie hard and not chewy",4
"quite traditional chinese tapas, cant believe they have pork belly tapas. my husband love it.",5
be careful they secretly added things you didnt order.,1
i love it here. great chinese street good. i never liked pickled vegetables until i had some in this place,5
"what a tremendous well run restaurant, great food and friendly service",5
"not good enough, tasted like plastic",2
amazing chinese pancake (go for pickles and pork belly) and the steamed buns are great too (pork especially). great value. great food.,5
the food here is delicious and pricing is attractive! high recommend !,5
excelent,5
food was delicious!,5
decent quality with cheap price,3
very delicious tapas! highly recommended!traditional chinese tapas and you can pay by alipay!!,5
delicious steam bun! good street food hot kitchen atmosphere. there could be more veggie options...,4
"twice i have been here now. it is recommended by a friend, and we werent disappointed. good food with a good price. easy location to find, few mins walk from leicester square station. would highly recommend to anyone who loves chinese tapas",5
absolutely amazing food. if you looking for authentic chinese food you will not be disapponted. huge delicious portions with reasonably priced. a must visit,5
delicious chinese crepes with fillings of enough options to choose from.,4
sooooooo good,4
jumjumjumjumjum had the crepes wit belly pork and pickels!! amazing!!!!,5
really good corner shop. has a good selection of food. recommend.,5
great variety of products. conveniently open *every* day of the year!,5
taro milk tea is great,4
"i love their bubble teas, but sadly the quality is uneven. four times on five they are excellent, and the fifth time it's disappointing with flavourless tea. often quite busy. a lot of options, i already came here at least a dozen of times and there is still stuff i'd like to try.",4
love the bubble tea!,5
best boba,5
my favourite tea ,5
"cute place, good drinks.  wish it came out a bit faster though",4
i have tried bubble tea from all over the world. the hazelnut bubble tea from here is the greatest thing to ever grace my tastebuds. i'd give it 100 stars if i could.,5
i have tried the taro and cuppacha classic pearl milk tea. it was okay but not excellent. there is not enough pearls. the place is too small and not very comfortable.,3
best hot drink in town ! it tastes better than it looks. #londonfoodie,5
"i like hot olong tea, after a while they give me a lookwarm tea ..when i complain a man inside look at me angry, they say it is hot... but the girl offer to change it for me.",3
best bubble tea i've ever had,5
chinatowns best bubble tea!!,5
very attentive helpful kind employees,5
"had my first ever bubble tea here. was a bit sceptic to begin with as it is something i never tried before but my god how amazing it was!!! watermelon milk tea, tasted like pure watermelon, not too sweet just perfect. cannot wait to return. prices might be a tiny bit more expensive but definitely worth it!",5
"i needed to stop visiting here, but all the teas taste so good. i don't love bubble tea per se, but love the tea itself. it can get really crowded here, but it's totally worth the wait. i wish they would expand and open another location. even dh thinks it's one of the best things on earth!",5
"with a friend and my fiance we tried this place. there was a long queue, we waited more than 30 minutes to be serve. it was my first time trying bubble tea. i didn't like it at all.",2
"best bubble tea shop around. along with a great selection of flavours and 'toppings' (bottomings?) you can choose how sugary your drink is. there's usually a seat free on the bench inside, there aren't many benches outside in china town.",5
"been there twice and i really like it, good customer service and quality, very fast too.",5
didn't have the ombre but enjoy my lychee black tea and white peach oolong!,4
really nice place,5
decent prices and a refreshing selection of drinks and snacks to choose from. staff get quite confused with orders when store gets super busy though,3
good tasting bubble tea with plenty of varieties. just need to sort out their air conditioning during summer periods.,4
"a great bubble tea place. a very wide selection of flavours, and bubbles - a lot of customisable options (sugar level, ice level, size is medium or large) hot and cold teas avalible.",5
loved it,5
"friendly, efficient staff. decent flavour range. relaxed atmosphere. always a pleasant experience. has a loyalty card scheme too!",4
very helpful staff.,5
"first time ever going to this place for bubble tea and it was a huge mistake, i mean that because of the queue, the wait was at least 20 minutes, packed with local students from the london school of economics, it was definitely worth the wait.",3
one of the best bubble teas in london! make sure to get a loyalty stamp card if you are a local!,5
"even with two other bubble tea places within walking distance, the line is out the door. similar prices to other bubble tea vendors but has a unique and extensive menu! would return.",4
finally a good taro milk tea!,5
one of the best bubble tea place.,5
delicious bubble teas..,4
best milktea in london!,4
my favourite bubble tea place,5
nice tasty bubble teagood variety of flavoursnice options 're popping balls / jellieslots of options 'regarding sugar and ice levelsnowhere to sit really queues possible,4
"also very good bubble tea here! this street has two good options for bubble tea, i still don't know which one i like better. service here is friendly and the bubble tea is yummy. don't forget to ask for adjusted sugar levels and ice! (else it is so so sweet)",5
busy af. not really worth the wait though. it's fine.,3
"tasted buble tea here, which was wonderful",4
"almost batting in the same league as happy lemon (not quite there yet).some of the syrups they use are phenomenally sweet, the ombre range should come with a warning.other than this, they make one of the best bubble tea in london and i wish i had one locally!",4
super tasty bubble tea - great range of flavors! you can adjust sweetness and temperature of the drink and creating your own favorite combos! :),5
the guy at the counter has this very horrible attitude. even trying to correct my pronunciation with his broken english. i would score it lower if 1 star is not the lowest. the tea is fine by the way.,1
so excited when i saw this shop. i got taro tea with pearls. absolutely delicious. lovely friendly man serving at the till and a very clean waiting area. highly recommended,5
got the strawberry and mango juice with mango jelly and lychee popping boba and it's really good! it's nice there's fruit options for those who don't want the milky tea.,5
"amazing range of bubble tea flavours,which is good but can be a bit overwhelming if it is your first time. you can choose sweetness ice and size of drink, while the tea itself tasted very nice.",4
great bubble tea and wide range of selection! bubbles are tasty. sadly not much space inside and no tables.,5
you can get really good bubble tea here!i usually get the roasted oolong pearl milk tea which  has got quite a unique taste to it.lots of other flavours to get so its really cool place to stop by if you're in the area,5
"fast service, even when super busy",5
one of the best bubble teas in london. also slightly better value than other bubble teas nearby.,5
i like the white peach oolong,5
the bubble tea tasted really bad despite other reviews. it tasted like soap and plastic i'm not sure how to describe it but it tasted exactly like washing up liquid water...,1
bit cramped but the bubble tea was nice,4
amazing bubble tea with a range of flavours. i always experience great cost omer service too. it does get quite busy but you get served quickly.,5
great one but the queue is just unreal. 30 mins for a bubble tea lol,4
delicious but i am not sure how healthy it is.,4
fantastic service. delicious products. i could live in this place!,5
"took half an hour and 10 for two drinks, not worth the wait.",3
"is a busy place, but is nice",3
"i have a feeling that the quality has deteriorated somewhat since the first time i tried it. service has gone slightly worse. i stopped getting extras. it takes longer to get my order. overall, the place is still decent though.",4
"good tea, but they are slow like hell",3
i like that you can choose the sweetness and the amount of ice. milk tea is a little bit bitter than most bubble tea places but it still suited my taste. usually less busier than the other bubble tea places around and inside has a nice atmosphere.,5
probably one of the best bubble teas you can find in london. you can always notice that their recepies are considered great even by those that are more picky in their bubble teas  their original cuppacha milk tea with tapioca is incredible!,5
the tea is lovely and it's great that you can customise the amount of sugar and ice that you want. the amount of options for different types of tea is vast too and you can choose your own toppings so you can truly create whatever you want. the staff are friendly and service is efficient even when they have big queues.,5
the best bubble tea place we have ever been to. theres a line out the door for a reason! we will definitely be back here every time we come to london.,5
"best bubble tea around, personal favourite: honey dew milk tea less ice 50% sugar and tapioca pearls.",5
"bubble tea was good but serving system not quite right, had to wait several minutes to order & then more minutes to receive the drink.",3
"if you've never had bubble tea before and don't really have a sweet tooth, try the original cuppucha milk tea (it's asam tea) with slight sugar (just one up from no sugar. these things get really sweet, even with half sugar), with pudding (smooth and subtly sweet) / tapioca pearls.",4
my favourite bubble tea place! love how the sugar level can be customised as i find some bubble tea very sweet.,5
amazing bubble tea definitely reccomend. love the variety and the staff are really kind. a bit hard to find but definitely worth looking for.,5
"solid, wide range of good tea. rapid service. limited space inside.",5
"taro root bubble tea, yum! ",4
very small so constantly being bumped into by people and expensive for bubble tea! tapioca pearls are even charged at 50p extra which should come normally at no extra charge. paid 4.30 for a regular drink and was too sugary despite asking for less sugar. won't be going back,2
it's taste alright among the other bubble tea shop,4
haha i had the ombre bubble tea which tasted great. they charged me 5 pence for a bag which they didn't really make clear ...,4
great tea with many options,5
very very friendly staff. the tea is absolutely amazing! tried the ombr and my oh my! a must!,5
"has a variety of flavours and some flavours are really nice. meanwhile, some flavoured bubble tea are ghastly",3
there are a variety of flavours to choose from and you can choose your sugar level which means that you can opt for lower or higher sugar. the staffs are also very friendly and the price is very reasonable for the quality and flavour of the tea.,5
i am addicted to this place!!! i have tried few bubble tea shops in london but when i visited cuppacha i knew i was going to visit them more.the tapioca were soft and chew. they have plenty of flavours to choose from and the staff very friendly.,5
my favourite bubble tea place. prices have risen by 10p recently. theres a large menu of different flavours and toppings. standard drink includes tapioca unlike chatime which charge 50p on top. it can get very busy and you will need to queue on weekends. they also have a loyalty programme.,5
"great tea, great staff. always go for a bubble tea when i'm in the area.",5
"they have a great selection of bubble tea flavours and topppings and allow you to choose the ice level and the sweetness levels as well. the fruit teas, especially the qq teas are the best and are just soo sweet and tasty here",5
"you have alternatives but cuppacha has something special for me. a lot of choices, from hot to ice cold drinks, flavours and toppings.",4
delicious milk tea in the heart of chinatown,5
"delicious! had real grapefruit in my tea, whose zest was not very delicious unfortunately. otherwise, very cool shop.",4
great selection of bubble tea options where you can select how much ice and sugar etc.,5
"a very very busy shop has long queues if you don't mind standing in a line for a while, then this place is for you",3
friendly staff and good selection of toppings. grass and fig jelly are a good alternative if you don't want to carb up on tapioca pearls. hot options are also lovely on a cold day. queues can be a bit long. ,4
i had a lychee tea and it was so sweet it was absolutely disgusting and basically undrinkable. and i usually like 100% sweetness if not more! i think perhaps maybe someone screwed up my order because it was ridiculous to the point it must have been an error.,1
i know bubble teas are so bad for you but these things are so addictive and i must have had more than 10 drinks here! my favourite so far is the matcha green tea with red bean. most of the time the queue extends out of the store but service is pretty quick so you should be in and out in 5-10 minutes.,4
"just a normal bubble tea shop, nothing special about the drinks.",3
they have a great selection of flavours (that are not always available depending on who is manning the counter) however service here can be incredibly slow and does anyone really have 30 minutes just to wait to get a bubble tea?,3
"one of the best bubble tea places in london, it has all the right stuff - vast number of flavors, hot or cold options, and amount of sugar. prepare yourself for a long queue.",5
great taiwan bubble tea in chinatown! the staff comes and goes so the quality varies a little - most of the time is good but sometimes unfortunately will be a bit let down.,5
the matcha bobba is one of the best.,5
best bubble tea in london,5
"delicious bubble tea, coffee jelly with milk with a tea underneath but a revelation was my friend's matcha with that tapioca topping! 50 p difference between a big or medium size makes decision easier and customise sugar is an excellent choice. almost 30 minutes waiting in a queue was a downer, avoid weekend peak times!",4
passion fruit tea with passion fruit popping pearls ,5
good bubble tea!,4
the best bubble tea int he world!,5
good bubble tea.,4
15 minute wait.... ! for 1 tea.,3
the four season tea is awful,2
brilliant and great service ... just bring back your loyalty card,5
best bubble tea place in london. beats bubble magic and bubbleology by a mile.,5
great variety of tea. especially pure tea for those who are conscious about their sugar intake.,5
amazing bubble tea!,5
i love this place whenever i'm in london i will go out of my way to get here - the drinks are soo good!!,5
good offerings with a friendly environment where you can have a short stay to enjoy your drinks,5
"large, cold hazelnut milk tea with tapioca pearls, less ice, half sugar. not for sharing!",5
"great choices, queue moves fast, friendly staff, japanese snacks also for sale at counter. ",5
"incredible bubble tea. there are so many options for flavours, bases, tapioca pearls, jellies, size and amount of sugar. definitely worth a visit.",5
great selection. tasty bubble tea and friendly staff.,5
"crowded, but tasty and interesting bubble teas:)",5
"service is slow even though there 3 people tunning the shop floor. ordered two drinks,  one was overly sweet, and the other normal milk tea tasted weak.  i think i can understand why happy lemon has the larger queue of customers next door when they both sell sort of the same stuff.",2
"waited only and few minutes and the staff were very friendly. i had a milk tea with bubbles (tapioca) and crumbled oreo biscuits on top. super tasty! get with regular sugar level or it will be far too sweet.they also serve steamed buns and loads of other bubble tea flavours and different ""bubbles"". will return!",4
great bubble tea well made.,4
lovely bubble tea and lots of sugar customisation options. if you choose regular sugar option it might be sweeter than you expect..   no blueberry or lime option.,5
"nice teas, but too expensive",4
not the best place for bubble tea,3
favourite bubble tea spot. have been getting my bubble tea fix from this place for five years. haven't found another place as good as this. so happy that they've started selling steamed buns too.,5
best boba place so far i know in london.,4
"one of the better bubble tea places in chinatown. their fruit teas are superb for hot weather, their chewy tapioca balls a bonus!",3
soo many options and you get to control the sugar and ice in your drinks but i wish i got to do it for the specials drink i got because it was too sweet,4
best taste and value for money around the chinatown area ,5
a great tasting selection.,5
love the shop. go in most evenings. could do with being bigger or having and in door and out door to better deal with queues,5
one of my favourite places!,5
better variety of flavours & toppings vs the other bubble tea shops nearby.,5
"friendly helpful staff, loyalty scheme and amazing bubble tea! the price is also decent. this is my go-to place when i am around chinatown. it is definitely worth waiting in line for an amazing bubble tea!",5
babe bubble tea in town. definitely try honeydew in hot milk flavour it one of the best ones they have,5
amazing bubble tea,5
"love this place!! so many flavours and varieties to choose from and lots of toppings too. brilliant that you can choose your sweetness levels and amount of ice. great, helpful staff and fairly priced. the mango milk tea is fab and the lychee popping boba is delicious :)",5
one of my favourite places in chinatown london! a must go! you need to try the milk bubble tea! delicious! sometimes has a queue but it's worth the wait! ,5
"lots of options but the first two ones i ordered they didn't have. but when i ordered one they had it was great. very busy, so a bit of a wait but it was worth it!",4
service isn't the best but the bubble tea is nice,3
my go to bubble tea place. gets very very crowded. has never gotten my order wrong. limited seating.,4
"really enjoyed drinks here, a wide variety to choose from.",5
"a definitely good spot to have a nice bubble tea. lots of customization options : size, sugar, ice, ""toppings"" and flavour ",4
"best bubble tea you will get in london, hands down. it's a shame there isn't another branch in the capital.",5
speedy service!,4
"love the matcha milk tea, not too keen on their version of milk tea though. queues are long during rush hour but served quickly.",5
classic bubble tea place,4
best place for bubbletea,5
my (joint) 1st fave bubbletea place in london - lychee green tea for the win!,5
incredible bubble tea,5
here ive tasted bubble tea for the first time. it was great. i felt in love with this tea flavor. so every time i drink bubble tea i remember this place and its atmosphere. highly recommend it to those who are still wondering what this tastes like.,4
good plum bubble tea,5
decent bubble tea but not the best around,4
love this place so many different options,5
fanciest bubble tea ever ,4
nice staff and good ice tea :),5
"amazing bubble tea! i really like this place and stay loyal to this shop as i believe they do the best bubble tea. the choice is big and staff always helpful. it's really worth a visit. at times it gets busy and people even have to line up outside the shop, but that's usually in the evenings. ",5
no sitting room but great variety. always busy and there is a reason. a must drop by if u love bubble tea,5
"there was a queue  but served very quickly nd then didn't have to wait long for the delicious drink, friendly staff",5
"cute place in chinatown, next to another drink shop! has a wide variety of teas, add-in toppings, and customization options, and no card minimum. a nice stop for a drink in chinatown after a meal.",5
"best bubble tea place in london, forever returning.",5
cuppacha has a wide range of bubble tea to choose from. i always have a classic bubble milk tea at all time.,4
very good but very hot because non air conditioner in shop.,3
"lovely, delicious tea, however it is quite busy, but that shouldn't stop you from trying it. we had the taro tea with tapioca which was very very nice, would recommend.",5
"always go there when i am around piccadilly circus, bubble tea is great",4
taro milk tea with tapioca bubbles are amazing. they don't contain any gelatine either so perfect for people with halal diet.,5
"uff some nice bubble tea ranges here, it was a long wait till me turn but the waiting time after delivery was less than a minute despite getting orders via phone queue etc bags cost 5p. no toilets a waiting room is here quite small but very busy in the heart of west central london",5
best bubble tea place in london.,5
i used to really enjoy cuppacha - great bubble tea and my boyfriend is happy because they do proper tea with popping candy and tapioca! unfortunate recent experience where someone barfed all over the floor and the staff did literally nothing about it which is rather disgusting.,3
one of the better bubble tea places in london.this one is always consistent and their taro always very good ,5
absolutely love their bubble tea.,5
tea is good and staff is nice. i specially liked morgan for hiz patience and his smile. it's very busy so there is almost never a place to sit and there is no place to stay and enjoy your drink. no toilet facilities available.,3
"best taro milk tea i've ever had, it's smooth and creamy and perfectly sweet, staff are really nice and helpful despite how busy the store is! i also had soy milk because i can't have dairy and the flavour was amazing! really glad they have non-dairy options ",5
for someone that loves bubble tea i always come here when i'm in london. especially love the strawberry milk bubble tea! if your new to cuppacha and don't like your bubble tea too sweet i'd recommend having less sugar in it.,5
great place to get a cup of bubble tea. wide selection of toppings and flavours,5
"i ordered ombre tea with blueberry flavour, it was very sweet eaven though i ordered it less sugar, in general it was quite good for its price, the shop itself was really and the line was so long, that it continued eaven outside of the shop. the service was nice, and quick.every 10th tea is free.",4
"very long wait for a disappointing boba milk tea. was hoping this would be a great boba shop, but ended up with a watered down milk tea. look elsewhere",1
"good bubble tea. fast efficient service - we ordered the cuppacha pearl tea which was good, reasonably priced and took about 5mins to arrive after ordering, seats available for waiting. can pay by card. conveniently located near leicester square tube and chinatown. takeaway shop.",4
"tons of different flavor options. hot or cold, different sugar options, ice or none, different bubble and jelly options. they also sell steam buns.",5
hands down the best bubble tea in all of london and quite possibly all of england. i never go to anywhere else as their quality is hard to beat. have been a loyal cutomer for many years now and always go when i get a chance.,5
bad bubble tea :(,1
"waited so long for a drink and it was super sweet, couldn't finish",1
"a sloth could serve drinks faster than they did. 20 minutes and still waiting. thought they were doing this deliberately to create a queue, but they're just super slow... they probably made 1 drink every 5 minutes?",1
"wow delicious bubble tea, the busiest in the area",5
"tasty. always busy, long queue outside. but it's worth it :)",5
"brilliant bubble tea shop, would recommend but avoid going for chinese new year, it gets very busy",4
pretty good bubble tea. all though i had better tapioca . definitely worth a try,4
quite good. loads of variety. not too expensive. great for bubble tea lovers,4
only thing i have to say is how much money they would make with a shop in orpington or bromley,5
gotta love a good cup of bubble tea,5
"lovely bubble tea with lots of options. there may be a queue  of peope waiting, and sometimes they don't have internet to pay with card, but still worth it if you like this type of cold tea.",4
tasty and most probably the best bubble tea in london,5
loud music which gave me a headache for the next 2 hours. felt incredibly rushed to make my order even though i'd never been before and had no idea what i was doing.,1
almost as good as in taiwan!,5
"i decided to stop by this bubble tea store and it was a great experience bar the queue, but you can expect this at a popular bubble tea store. a great menu and i'll be coming there more often. thank you to vicky for serving me and providing excellent customer service.",5
loved the place so much. the lady who served me is such a sweet person and the bubble tea was amazing. thank you!,5
intriguing place.took forever to be served. the woman serving me took a few minutes to work out how to give me 85 pence change for a 5 note.i ended up receiving 50p in 5p's and 35p in 1 and 2p's.the drink took such a long time to be made too.2/10 - won't go again.,2
nice place to hang out.. nice tasting bubble tea.. it was really good.,4
"if you like bubble tea you'll love cuppacha, it's a small place with a big choice and great service.",5

small space and quite crowded but great selection and quality. totally recommend.,4
"great boba! staff are also super nice. yet, service took too long. i had to wait 20 minutes for a single cup of boba.",4
love it as per usual! took a friend from manchester who also liked what he got. been multiple times before and will continue to go! can get busy and the waiting time can be slightly long but that's expected in china town and central london.,5
excellent bubble teas. the tapioca pearls are always perfectly cooked.,5
tasty bubble tea just near the leicester square.,4
"very poor bubble tea. cold when chose the hot one, and grainy matcha flavour. when told it wasn't hot, and asked them to remake it, they just added hot water which diluted the tea.",1
best bubble tea in london! highly recommended.,5
"my favourite bubble tea spot in chinatown! theres usually a queue out the door, but it moves pretty quickly so dont be put off.",5

"came in really late and it looked like the girls were packing up but they still took orders from me and my cousins. delicious bubble tea and friendly smiles from all staff. i highly recommend the taro bubble tea, one of my faves",5
woeful service. more than happy to take your money but youll have to wait 30 minutes for a cup of tea...,3
"my niece loves bubble tea and particularly this place. there are so many bubble tea places but  this one seems to have the longest queues.they only had one member of staff serving, which considering the popularity of the place is just silly because it took aaaages to get thr bubble tea.",4
"good bubble tea, but waiting time 30mins+",3
absolutely terrible. the boba tea was watery and trash. do not go here.,1
"good taro bbt but way too sweet (i got half sugar, will try 20% sugar next time)",4
terrible. waited almost 30 minutes for 1 cup of bubble tea. the staffs were messing around and not doing their job,1
i go all the way to chinatown every time i'm in london just for cuppacha. love it so much! they let you personalize your drink down to the last drop.,5
"good bubble tea, but extremely busy hence expect a long wait!",4
"very nice pearl milk tea. one of my favourite in town. went with my friends. some of us love it, some other a bit less. is a convenient location and has affordable prices. not a very big shop, but big enough for chill a bit.",5
bubble drink was lovely but waited 10 mins for it.,4
the drinks are always good here and always collect stamps! the buns are also worth thier price,5
i always eat here! noodles are always fresh,5
"i regularly crave their mango milk tea, but they lost one star due to loooong lines and slooooooow service.",4
"excellent bubbletea with a wide range of flavors. they don't just have the regular milk based ones, they also have water based and more lemonade like ones, with jelly, bobba and popping pearls. only downside is that it's a small shop that's very warm and you often have to wait a while, but it is worth the wait. prices are good too",4
excellent menu of bubble tea and speedy service. highly recommend.,5
"if you like this bubble tea, its very good place ! there is line to wait, but they make it very good with a lot of combinations.",5
delicious matcha redbean tea. big variety of fruit tea.,5
the bubble tea is food but they are outrageously slow for mediocre tea. i really like their bubble tea but not worth the wait. also... i think their pork bun gave me extreme diarrhea so be weary and ask them when they were made. the pork bun was delicious but made me really sick that night!,2
"loved this pub, belgium beers are my absolute fave and this bar does not dissapoint. lots of different beers to choose from both on tap and bottles.place feels warm and cozy and there are quite a few places to sit. bar staff were very helpful if you needed advice with beer choices.will deffo visit again :)",5

"love this pub. very casual, very dutch, massive beer selection. don't go upstairs though, has the reputation of smelling weird upstairs and went i went to see (smell) for myself, it was true. but all is great downstairs. they also have traditional dutch food, both bar food and proper meals.",4
fantastic place - we went there for the belgium vs tunisia world cup match and loved the ambience created. we received free (great quality) belgium t-shirts that we have kept and now wear for every belgium match and the beers there are bloody amazing! staff are very friendly and accommodating - overall great experience.,5

amazing selection of beers and great screens for the football. loads of space and seats upstairs if it looks busy downstairs.,5

"fantastic bar with lots of dutch and belgian beer choices, i'll definitely be back again ",5

great bar great choice if beers. great for watching sports.,5
"they were objectively racist. i have never written a review, but at a belgian pub, i was refused drinks (as is their right) without any clear reason (if you are passed out or throwing up you should be refused), but lucid it is shocking",1
"quirky, noisy but still a good place to kick off an evening",4
"what a great find and a real treat for central london! hosting german and belgium beers, this place would add an interesting and playful dimention to the casual 'meet and drink'! the prices are decent, especially for being so central, and staff are friendly and helpful.",5

"i got hooked on this place. the best bartender ever who really knows the selection of beers they have (90 something of import beers). if you ever experienced  good dutch beers you will find one, like me (le chouffe). don't worry if u have no clue, the bartender guy can offer something that will  blow your mind.",5

great atmosphere. expensive beers.,3
"it's a nice pub in that there us a decent choice of beers and is not unreasonably proceed given its location. however, it absolutely stinks of chlorine as they use a cleaning product that is far too strong and chemical. this is totally overpowering and really spoils the pub experience.",3
delirium tremens on tap! dangerous.,5
mice old pub on the edge of chinatown.,4

best pub in town. for dutchies anyway,5
"nice quality pub, friendly",5
to the general manager who attacked me for breaking the furniture that i did not break: check cctv before attacking me and making my friend cry. that was just shocking and disgusting!,1
i enjoyed the great selection of belgian beers they have! the food was great as well,5
very helpful barman. didn't have the beer i wanted but had a tasty similar one in his fridge upstairs.,5

"fantastic institution for beers, snacks and football in the heart of central london",5
fantastic little pub with great history! good selection of beers but can get a little crowded..,5
large selection of dutch beers on tap.the bitterballen are home made and taste differently from the ones you would typically find in the netherlands.,4
"food was cold and had two hairs! the staff were mostly nice, apart from a few that were really patronising and hostile! over priced. don't go!",1
great pub with a good selection of wines. it's a central london pub so naturally it gets pretty busy at times. but it has great character and the staff are nice.,5
come here if you want to meet fellow dutch,5
loved the place.  a fantastic pub right in the middle of the westend.a great choice of beers but unfortunately some work needed in regards to service by some bar staff.,5
if you want great dutch or belgium beer this is the place. comfy setting and friendly staff. one i spoke to even was duch himself :),5
"perfect place for watching dutch football, have a variety of dutch beers and snacks.",5
a tradeoff between a tourist place and an oppotunity to drink belgian beer on tap,3
"always busy, sometimes takes a while to get served becos of this",4
"been here with friends in a rainy afternoon. the place is really nice and cosy, with tables on ground floor and 1st floor. we had a good cider and a very good mixed plate of dutch starters (sausages and croquettes) as a shared snack. multiple big screens were present, showing current football matches.",4
"have to be the best doughnuts i've personally had in london, tad bit pricey but one will certainly leave you satisfied",5
beautiful donuts but slightly overrated. i'm a simple girl who likes simple donuts.,4
"amazing doughnuts, dont know the name of the chap, but customer service was brill and with a smile",5
not the best donuts. overly sickening. very expensive for bread and icing.,1
fab donuts and love the novelty names! david hassle-biscoff... yum,5
delicious and incredibly clever. loved the names and flavours of the doughnuts. bit pricey at 4.50 each but it's an experience.,5
"( no gluten free doughnuts ) i went all the way there, because i read the previous post that they have gf doughnuts but they don't. so please anyone will post a review you must be sure about your information, otherwise this will happen again for others!",5
doughnuts very tasty and fresh just a bit doughy.,4
sugarrush. is the word to describe it. coviniently located by the busstop. missed three buses trying to decide which one to choose.,4
my fave lotus vegan donut ,5
the doughnuts look tasty and very picture worthy although when you bite into them they are quite bland and stale. also very pricey. can recommend to go and take a picture of the collection but not sure if they are worth the price.,3
"the donuts looked way better than what they actaully taste like, prefer dunkin donuts, sorry.",3
when they first opened their doughnuts were amazing. lately though ive found theyre always dry and stale. its basically like icing on a dry cake ring.  for better value youre better off with a krispy kreme from tesco.,2
"so good, so big and have vegan options.",5
"this place is one of my favourite places to visit in london. there's no sitting in, it's literally just a take away option, but the range of flavours and toppings are incredible. me and my partner have been twice and each time we have not been let down. the prices are excellent considering how large each doughnut is.",5
first visit and definitely won't be the last,5
love those doughnuts. i used to get them back in australia with friends a lot. having said that however i was shocked by the rude staff member who basically ignored me for 5 minutes and then only said 2 words in total. kinda ruined my excitement of getting doughnuts.,4
love the names of these doughnuts. definitely makes you look twice and want to get some. sugar overload but actually quite good as i had feared the visual and names were compensating for the taste. kept on seeing many people near the shop with the boxes so must be popular too.,4
"small stall rather than a shop but that works in its favour where you can pick the doughnut you want and go, friendly staff aswell",5
"stylish donuts with all types of flavours.if you need a sugar boost, thats the place. worth the taste and a comeback. there is a classic option as well. well behaved staff and baked at the place.",4
small shop but great doughnuts,4
"their doughnuts are absolutely delicious. they are also huge, get ready for a lifetime of sugar in your mouth!",5
frieny and easy to get too,5
they look nice but they are so sickly sweet that i only managed one bite. also the kinder bueno was a basic chocolate donut with pieces of kinder on top,1
"this store does accept cash which is good, the attention was on point, but now talking about what is important, the doughnuts really amazing, is bigger that the average and original.",5
the doughnuts are delicious but it's a bit pricey.,3
"amazing donuts, don't worry about the calories.",5
"nice looking place in a great location with great branding, but the doughnuts weren't that great. the two we got were very sickly, not all that tasty and very expensive for what they are!",2

"dont miss out on the nutella or rolo doughnuts, by far the best, i have tried them all :)",5
"artisan doughnuts to die for, if your in the mood for doughnuts give your taste buds a treat and skip the krispy cremes and go straight for these bad boys instead",5
"i really wanted to like this after the first donut i tried, but subsequent ones i've had were quite horrible.  they are also quite overpriced at 5 pounds a donut!",3
tasty vegan doughnuts but little bit expensive,4
"the donuts are nice. however, a fiver for one donut it is too expensive.",3
"below average doughnut covered in an excess of store-brought flavours with a cute name and an excessive price tag.  not good, not worth it, and the staff is rude!",1
"if i was going by i'd get a doughnut but wouldn't come specially. they are a bit overpriced. i wanted a sugar doughnut, don't like fillings but they didn't have it so had the nutella one... lots of nutella inside. this is just a kiosk, so you can only takeaway or eat it on the street.",3
may be a bit pricey but for the size of the doughnuts and the variety it's defo worth it!,5
they do percy pig doughnuts. well worth the trip!,5
"lovely little hole in the wall for doughnuts, i found them absolutely massive and full of filling. do good deals on the more doughnuts you buy.",5

quite possibly the best doughnuts. great selection with the funniest names. give it a go ,5
"doughnuts look fantastic, however i found that they selected a doughnut from the front shelf - dry and stale. you really need to be providing customers with the freshest specimens - so would not recommend!",2
tried their christmas red velvet doughnuts its tastes and looks so delicious! will buy again for our christmas tea dessert,5
great doughnuts but you should probably share one with a friend because they are big!,5
"ordered online the day before, very easy pickup the next day! vegan doughnuts were delicious, the best tasting in london! doughnuts were already neatly packed in a box and presentation was perfect when we got them out later ",5

amazing! love this place!,5
amazing doughnuts. had bueno mars. tasted delicious!,5
"amazing doughnuts way better than other doughnut shops, wide array of flavours and so filling. if you arrive just before closing expect a limited choice of doughnuts though.",5
too sweet and full of suger,3
large doughnuts... very good tasting!!,5
my favourite place in london! been a couple times an dloved it every single visit,5
if you love doughnuts then this is the place to go. great taste.,5
pricey but delicious doughnuts at this booth-like shop. expect long queues at weekends!,4
"great selection of doughnuts, with different coatings and fillings.but prices are a bit excessive.",4
"i am giving them 3 stars for innovation, variety and size (huge donut). i tried 4 different flavors and all were bland and donut dry (not fresh). its a shame after all this hype! they could definitely do better especially that they are charging 4+ per donut!",3
"really fun little kiosk a short walk from china town.yes the doughnuts do appear a little overpriced but wow! they are huge! we really enjoyed the ones we had, each probably contains your daily calorie intake but oh well!they also offer a loyalty card which is stamped for every doughnut you buy.",4
"i love this place. the doughnuts are amazing, - so so yummy! and they do vegan ones which are so tasty.",5
most incredible donut,5

great doughnuts,5
"amazing been wanting to stop by this place for a long time, got a selection today and i ate one and cant look at the rest there massive, top quality, highly recommended, would definitely call again when am back in london.",5
fantastic doughnuts and friendly staff.,4
the filling of the one called robert d'oreo (or something like that) wasn't good. the lotus one was quite good. the second time i ordered kinder and that was reaaally amazing.,4
not cheap buy good selection and tastes great,5
"the doughnuts are great and very big, the only gripe i have is they need more amazing variety to choose from.",4
just amazing!,5
the doughnuts are plentiful and customer service is superb. there is a lot of choice and they even offer vegan doughnuts for those interested. the bueno mars doughnut is sublime and even just one of them will fill you up.,5
"creative doughnuts, interesting flavours.",4
"indulgence at it best! such an enticing selection of doughnuts, had the 'bueno mars' and it was amazing. doughnuts are huge so they can almost serve as a whole meal if you have a small appetite ^^ very good quality food, full of sugar sure, but a little extra never hurt anybody, just please yourself and enjoy a piece of pure happiness ",5
oh so delicious.  ice ice bae bae forever!,5
"amazing selection although, not as fresh as they could be!!",4
yaaaaaas! the vegan option is absolutely delicious.,5
i go here to buy the delicious vegan doughnuts though they sell non vegan as well. they are huge!,4
"i'm glad someone recommend me this place. the hans solo and ice ice baby ones were amazing. i mean it's worth the massive spike in blood sugar. i will be back, would love to see a  cream egg one.",5
tasty doughnuts...,4
poor quality doughnut batter which is super greasy and with sickening sweet toppings and fillings. i would not recommend the current recipes.,1
"i live for these doughnuts. holy moly, so good.",5
a bit pricy but very delicious,4
great doughnuts with lovely service!,5
"the doughnuts are absolutely massive and look delicious, but unfortunately neither myself nor my partner thought they tasted like much at all. very bland and overly sickly sweet. not worth the 9 we paid for 2 at all - stick to krispy kreme.",2
the doughnuts will amuse you. believe me! one doughnut costs 4.5 which i believe is more than worth it!!,5
they have very delicious doughnuts!,5
"nice staff and a quick service! it's a shame the biscoff one was sold out (which was the one i wanted) but seems like it sells out quick.if you want it, go early afternoon! i will.",5
"very instagrammable! doughnut was a little dry this time compared to the last time we had it, when it tasted very fresh",3
the nutella and the lotus are the best,5
"nice doughnuts, very large but still too expensive in my opinion. however was a nice treat.",4
every time i'm in london i go here and absolutely adore the doughnuts. one piece of advice: don't eat them sitting in the bus stop by the shop... it gets very messy!!,5
"best doughnuts i've ever eaten! they have a great selection of donuts which cost around 4.50 each. whilst the price seems high, the donuts do taste amazing.",5
"sweet, sweet doughnuts. homer would be in heaven.",5
loved their vegan donuts ,5
"my fave doughnuts.  every branch ive been to the staff are super friendly, the doughnuts are always so fresh and tasty",5
"takeaway service only!but, the doughnuts are amazing! a must try, beware they only have a few flavours and they sell out quick!",4
"great looking doughnuts and tasted good, a doughnut costs 4.50",4
"loved this place! the doughnuts are huge, i couldn't even finish one. great selection. it's around 4.50 a doughnut but if you buy more some deals are available. everyone should try this place even just once. i hope i'm near by again soon!",5
these are great go when you can. always can not wait to go back,5
"i love donut time! its awesome and just made for social media. the donuts are delicious and i don't feel to guilty as they are gluten free and vegetarian! if you ever go i suggest you pick the ""stranger rings 2.0"" if you're a chocolate lover and a fan of the tv show stranger things. but it would 110% if they added a seating area.",4
definitely on the pricier side for dough nuts but so worth it. best donut i have ever had (vegan red velvet). they have a vast selection of vegan doughnuts as well,5
best doughnuts around! amazing flavours especially the stuffed nutella one!,5
best doughnuts i've ever had. can't stress this enough: do not miss.,5
cracking doughnuts,5
it's quite good (to look at and & eat),5
fantastic doughnuts with great names,4
great doughnuts and customer service - highly recommend chocolate orange,5
"very expensive!,  and nothing special.",2
expensive for just a flour with an icing on top,1
"i tried 2 types of donuts , they were good and instagramable. but they didnt have any filling in them . if you like the sugary old style donut u will love them , plus the crazy topings on top.",3
my ability to get healthy is constantly thwarted by the most amazing doughnuts that doughnut time make. i'm going to have to ban myself from soho if i want to survive because they're just too delicious to say no to if you're nearby.,5
"great doughnuts, just wish you could eat in!",4
great doughnuts! you dont know what to choose actually. we had one filled and one not. both so tasty!,4
"delicious, huge donuts with funny names. not cheap but well worth it.",5
well what can i say i work in leon next to you guys.best customer service. best doughnuts you can eat anywhere.once you have the first bite you don't want to stop.i love you guys a lot xx,5
the most amazing doughnuts you will find not every season is the same you will find the doughnuts rotate its a london thing and maximum respect to the customer service if you have love for doughnuts and in the city make sure you dont miss out ,5
i believe that this place and crosstown doughnuts are the best in london,5
"yummy doughnuts, great flavour choices!",5
i absolutely am in love with their doughnuts. thank you to the lady also who called us to say they ran out of the doughnut i ordered and asked if i wanted a replacement. great doughnuts and even better customer service!!,5
the best doughnuts,5
delicious doughnuts!,5
best doughnuts ever. the names are punny and full of joy. they are pricey but massive and tasty. big love. fair dinkum tasty ,5
"these are just great tasting doughnuts, well worth the price, they are massive, loved every bite...cant wait for some more....",5
sugarcoma!  amazing doughnuts ,5
"prepare yourself for a queue, luckily it goes fast. innovative names and even more innovative looking doughnuts might confuse you to thinking that your eating something else than deep fried flour and sugar. if you want to slash +4 on that, this is definitely worth it. if you just need a sugar hit, go to anywhere that sells doughnuts.",4
"we passed this counter several times while walking the streets of london. we caved on the third pass, and it was worth it. we tried the chocolate orange, the nutella filled, and the cookie dough. while a little pricy, the doughnuts were large, and the staff was very friendly.",5
these doughnuts are to die for!!! a little pricey but you get what you pay for and this is london so it's to be expected.,5
vegan option are bangin'!!!!!!,5
"best doughnut i've ever had, very expensive though.",5
"the donut names and selections are really fun (shout out to snicki minaj and notorious p.i.g.). but i found the taste quite lacking overall, after having tried three different flavours. the really big size of the donuts actually takes away from the ""donuty"" taste. fun for a visit but the taste is nothing special.",3
nice variety of donuts but not your typical store bought donuts.,3
fantastic doughnuts but no seating. so beware.,5
they have fixed doughnuts! everything i tried from here was amazing especially the snicki menaj and the red velvet,5
great doughnuts.... tasty,5
great roadside kiosk with a variety of tasty options.,4
this shop doesn't have seats. it is a takeaway shop. their doughnuts were quite good. i tried ice ice bae. it was huge and extremely sweet. but i still loved it. i felt the price was a bit high but it's ok to try once in a while. they do have some offers for purchasing 4 or 5 doughnuts together.,3
"excess! and then some. i'm not a vegan, but don't be deterred by the vegan label on some doughnuts, they are just as amazing as all the rest.",5
"randomly found it on a while walking through london, not only are the doughnuts big and tasty the flavours are fun and silly which is great. the girl in there was really nice and helpful as well making my selection for me when i couldn't decide... if you happen to see it, thanks twix one was a great choice",5
i'm fat now but it was worth it.,5
spectacular doughnuts,5
overpriced and bland - very disappointed,1
"ok, this place is legit. great donuts with a variety of flavor combinations. you could split one easy.",5
meh..................... something is off with this place. australia still had the best when they where open! heavy and stale unfortunately,3
best doughnuts. i love these guys,5
nice treat now and then,3
"not bad doughnuts, but they are very big and clunky. you are far better served with crosstown, which have in my opinion a more polished and delicate flavor profile than this.",3
"the bueno mars doughnut was the best doughnut i have ever eaten - and i've eaten a lot of doughnuts. of all the ones i tried i was impressed, huge, amazing dough, generous fillings, ridiculous and unique toppings... best doughnuts ever",5
"so worth the wait, so delicious!",5
"doughnuts are absolutely delicious, my favourite was a red velvet cream cheese one but they seemed to have doing this one last time i was there. also have vegan ones",4
possibly some of the best doughnuts in london,5
"went there really late at night, sadly there wasn't much choice but the two doughnuts i had were amazing can't wait to go back to london to try more.",5
"ive been here a few times now. excellent merchandising, but this place is very hit-and-miss. the donuts generally arent fresh enough. too bad.",3
stranger rings donut . filled with nutella. definitely a two person operation to finish. amazeballs.,5
best food i've ever eaten in my entire life!!!!!,5
"i love the donut time in old street, i came to the piccadilly one with my sister after dinner and was so excited but there were flies crawling all over the donuts! it made me feel sick so we instantly walked away!",1
"one for 4.5  a little bit too expensive , i order the one with chocolate crumble on the top and with some ganache dressing without stuffing inside . its good but not great , i will say it is so so and maybe other flavor will better.",3
best doughnuts in town imo (also i love the puns),5
the best tasting doughnuts ever.,5
5ver for a doughnut...dont need a meal after it.,5
side doughnuts packed with flavours. they should open a coffee shop so you can have a coffee with the amazing doughnuts.,5
very tasty fast and efficient. only thing no napkin as very sticky,5
amazing ,5
simply delicious,4
"quite expensive for a doughnut, but when i got home to eat it, i could absolutely appreciate why. very delicious if you're in the mood for a fancy doughnut",4
excellent donuts.,4
easily the best doughnuts ive ever had - amazing range of doughnuts and friendly staff!,5
"second time visiting here, always a queue and for good reason! amazing doughnuts!",5
nice doughnuts. should try the chocolate one with oreos!,5
"great lady serving us on sunday,",5
love the nuttela stuffed doughnut  prices from 4 and above good size,4
"very lovely, staff are nice and the doughnuts, whilst expensive, always hit the spot",4
"funny seeing 5* reviews when the shop had not opened / existed in this location...also, shop was closed within its opening times - with no indication when it would be open, so it's roll-the-dice if you are paying a visit.",1
delicious doughnuts! emma was super nice and told us lots about the different flavours :),5
"oooo these donuts! so for me the veruca salt (salted caramel) donut is a winner - fluffy donut and super tasty caramel (i could easily eat a bowl of that caramel) also the donuts have fab names, and are of course tasty :)",5
the filling tasted off and the staff were very rude. crosstown or even krispy kreme is much better.,1
"as homer would say... ""mmmmm doughnuts""you'll see the place as there'll be a queue. i'd recommend the whole doughnuts so you can enjoy the fillings.good options for vegans too!",5
lovely donughts sterp price about 4-6 each,5
awesome dougnuts. vegan options,5
expensive artisan doughnuts for the connoisseur,3
love this place!!,5
cute and delicious!,5
limited collection of high quality doughnuts,4
"great vegan doughnuts, downside... they always tun out of them!",4
tasty donuts very good quality,5
"nice place, a lot of vegan options",5
by far the worst doughnut i've had in my life. it was so hard and stale and just decorated with twix and made to look delicious. tasted like a 2 week old doughnut...then charged me 4.50 for it in stratford westfield!,1
"awesome, but not cheap!",4
delicious doughnuts!!! could have better prices though,4
huge am super delicious doughnuts,5
"amazing doughnuts. each of them is a piece of art. and quite filling.however, be ready to pay 4.50 for a doughnut...",4
"fun and funky. one doughnut is enough to share between 2 or 3 people, and extra large doughnuts are available too!",5
some were quite good but others might be a little too sweet. could you launch some less sweet choices please? (e.g. dark choc! ),4
"perfect doughnut everytime i go , i only get once a month now cause it a tad pricey for a 4 pack but nonetheless still deliciously good.",5
great doughnuts and very interesting flavours. friendly staff.,4
a fantastic selection of vegan donuts! i suggest they get some string to tie the boxes so they can be carried securely and easily.,5
"had a pb & j.lo, big, ugly, below average. heavy dough, cheap tasting jam and peanut butter, 4 each, so extremely bad value for money.  rather have a krispy kreme at a push or even better paul's chocolate doughnuts/beignets, no instagram needed there.",2
"sickly, just lots of sugar and over priced for doughnuts",1
it's always gay time doughnut is the best one!!! highly recommend,5
"brilliant shop! not the cheapest but anything bought here is certainly validated by its quality and uniqueness! products change regularly, but always a goid variety. i chose the houston, we have a biscoff, which was amazing! go out of your way to get here, it's a must visit.",5
amazing donuts,5
overpriced and not nice soft serve,1
amazing donut. i had the creme de la creme and wish i could have tried more. the bitter sugar on top offsets the sweetness of the filling.,5
"best. doughnuts. ever. seriously this place is awesome, used to buy back in melbourne and so happy it's here now. staff are super friendly and helpful too.",5
disappointing. look better than they taste. krispy kreme much better.,2
delicious doughnuts - very sweet and sickly so probably a good idea to share. ,5
"had the nutella. overpriced. tasted old and refrigerated. not saying they were... maybe they're better in the morning after not being store the whole day... the doughnuts are more of a dense cake, not soft and warm like freshly made traditional ones.",2
overpriced. overrated.,1
huge and delicious treats.,4
delicious but pricey! definitely more of a treat rather than a weekly snack. i bought the doughnut with the ferrero rocher and it was delicious! also cost about 4. friendly service.,5
delicious donuts. takeaway only here.,5
great dessert place,5
i cant get over this place. best doughnuts going,5
amazing doughnuts. like kk on crack.,5
 who don't love a doughnut!?,4
prices are ok. but it's not the best vegan or non vegan donuts i've had. a bit of a disappointment. i've even gone to another doughnut time and had better donuts.,2
authentic,5
too much thick filling. the bueno bar on top tasted like it was 5 years old.,3
one of the best dumpling restaurant in china town!,5
excellent!,5
lovely dim sum,5
the best dumplings in china town!,5
always a winner,5
wow. just wow!!!!!,5
"pretty good food, but closer to average. service was good, nice vibe too! enjoyed the tap beer and spicy dishes(szechuan beef and hot soup).",3
"great food. very busy and service not the fastest. but was chinese new year weekend, so maybe the reason!  not sure how fast usually. great food, kinda worth waiting for. staff friendly",4
"the dishes are good and some are very tasty. however, i've been consistently let down by the service. they've forgotten my order a few times and they can be quite rude/defensive sometimes, even though it's clearly written that i've ordered the dish. i've had to wait over an hour for a dish even though it was not crowded.",3
"get you in, get you out.... pretty much sums up the service here but that's not necessarily a bad thing. you come here to eat a lot and enjoy your comfort foods not sit down to a poncy meal. fyi the food is very good ",4
clean and spacious seating by compare of others places,5
"really good food. especially their dumplings, as you would expect. if you crave for some delicious chinese - definitely pop in or order online. probably would have ordered online if i didn't live that far as it tends to get a bit noisy in the restaurant.",5
great if you're out late night in central london and you happen to be near chinatown. dumplings are fantastic and it's pretty cheap. this is not a fancy restaurant though so see it as a casual place to eat. kitchen usually closes at 2am.,4
i had sour soup (starter portion) and pork&vegetable dumplings. both meals were very tasty. service was also very good and quick. pity that the place doesn't serve any desserts after 11pm. my friend and i really wanted something sweet.,4
"dim sum here was wonderful! it really hit the spot, one of the better ones in london. service was prompt, nothing to fault. prices were pretty reasonable.",5
"not impressed by service, quality of the dumplings were not as good as we expected",1
food was great.you should try the crispy duck,5
"food 4*, service 3* at best.",3
good fresh dimsum made on site. love their xiao long bao and large har gau!,4
service is great top notch management,5
average food.... some staff very off hand,2
awesome dim sum but poor service,4
great value and great food!! loved the dumplings!!!!,5
food was ok. service wasn't the best. they're in a hurry to rush through what you have to ask or say and that resulted in us having to ask for things multiple times! we only went here cos it had a high hygiene rating.,3
v friendly attentive service.,3
it is okay,3
great food and great service. i'll come again.,4
"food won't blow your mind, but it's a bit cheaper than other chinese restaurants in the area.",4
very good and authentic food,5
best dumplings ever and delicious food,5
"best place for dumplings and just before chinese new year. attentive staff, overall good service at the busiest time of year. even gave a discount when paying in cash.",5
only for lovers of chinese food.,2
"dumplings are the best thing about this place. great options and full of flavour. everything else was a little bland. spring rolls tasted frozen and the rice added very little in terms of taste. dont try and be clever here, keep it simple and go for dumplings",3
good chinese food with dim sum as their speciality.,5
"good prices, quick service, so many options on the menu!",4
"i love this place, i always go here when i visit london, their soup dumplings are fantastic",5
"loved the prawn dumplings, scallop, and minced pork bun. bbq ribs would not get again. will go back. good service and delicious.",4
nice and very happy to have dined there,5
"beef hofan was good, curry is so so, the only restaurant open for late night super on that street",4
"great food, funny staff, open late, good atmosphere, 5*",5
really great dim sum at reasonable prices,5
food was fantastic but service wasnt great. best chinese food i have had in a long while.,4
service wasn't great and i've had better dumplings at home. i guess that legend was that they were decent.,2
"wonderful dumplings, just be careful how you eat them when they first arrive very hot!",4
this place is amazing. i must stop whenever i'm in london. i have only been for lunch i may add. the sister restaurant down the road is just as good,5
the food came quick and it was absolutely delicious,5
"open late at night. seriously tasty. plus you can see the cook folding the dumplings. oh, and the crispy duck is indeed extra crispy. ",5
"food was delicious, the staffs are friendly. coming back again here for sure. thank you for the warm welcome.",5
"yestarday i went for the first time and i definately come back!!i ate spicy beef noodles soup was delicious! dumpling as well!just made,really fresh!good portions and reasonable price!",5
"good food, not very nice service",4
"tasty food and very good value for money. doesn't have a big dim sum menu if dining in the evening, but there are some options you can choose from. food is bought out quickly with an efficient service, a good go to place for a quick bite in china town where you won't be waiting very long for a table.",4
the quality of the food was nice.,4
dumplings are very good. the silken tofu with minced pork was amazing.,4
"the food was bland and service very poor, it felt like our presence was an inconvenience. if it wasn't for the fact that we'd had a long day and were tired we would have left.",3
"great atmosphere, nice decor and best of all the food! a great range on the menu and traditional and the dumplings are to die for, hence the name!",5
"awful service. waiter completely ignored us when we said our food was cold, after they brought the rice out 15 minutes before the mains. wont be returning",1
"my favourite guilty pleasure in london! definitely my favourite dumpling restaurant in china town, delivering consistent food quality and good pricing, look past the decor and fast paced service and enjoy their xiao long bao.",5
enjoyed a massive shared meal with family and friends. couldn't stop eating. such lovely food and attentive staff,4
"located right in the heart of downtown london. prince charles and camilla, dutchess of cornwall dined there. food was great. so good i forgot to take a pic before we began eating. will definitely go again",5
"fairly expensive, takeaway quality food. probably fairly priced for the location, though",3
good value for money and good quality xiaolongbao!,4
"good dumplings, a bit pricey but good.",4
great dumpnings! i had to ask for more!,4
lovely place p,5
going back soon,5
tasty!,5
rushed into deciding on menu choices and were not given change after paying the bill.,2
"best dimsum in china town! no frills, just great food. 100% recommend handmade prawn dumplings, they are incredible. prices are great and service is quick.",5
"the dumplings were lovely, but there was something lacking ... maybe the ambience and i don't think i'll be rushing back.",3
this place is pretty chinese and really good. it's more local than most of places you can find around. the beef with turnip is a must!they are very generous with vegetables and try the beef noodles as they have several ways to do them.,5
"it was okay, all the dumplings we shared tasted the same. nothing out standing but the only restaurant that was open after 22:30 on a weekday which is great ( they open until 03:00) service was quick.",3
wow way too salty. pushy staff. i'm not part of a restaurant conveyer system. first time for me and my date. without doubt the last.,2
"decent quality, very fast service, i would go again but next time i will try the dumplngs.",4
"xiao long bao (excuse the spelling) is so fresh, it can't be beaten. expect your food to come very quickly, and your check to come quickly after.the variety of dishes is well executed and tasty with generous portions.",4
brilliant food. service was a bit slow and all over the place with multiple servers asking the same things. tables were crammed in quite tight so it felt like we were on top of the tables either side of us.,3
lovely place reward for not using cards great food,5
"value for money, quick service even though it was busy.",3
"good food, nice staff and good prices too.  open late. great find.",4
the soup inside xiao long bao seeped out right after serving. so the soup was all over the table instead. hope they fix this for food quality.,3
get there early and definitely try the bao! absolutely delicious!,5
busy restaurant with lots of people turning over all the time but food is just great and it is good value. the service is fast and not particularly friendly so ideal if you just want great food. try the dim sum range or the sia long bau which are very fresh and done by in the kitchen daily.,4
really great food and service was ok too. would highly recommend this place.,5
dumpling were excellent. portions are biig so be ready.,4
quick service and they arent joking about being dumpling legends!,5
"quick service, nothing special on dim sum",3
"if you want an authentic oriental taste experience in the heart of china town, then this is the place. just take a look at the menu, they have rabbit!! i must admit that it's not for the faint hearted but everything is absolutely delicious and full of flavour!!!",5
"good dim sum, but cramped sitting space and grumpy staff.",4
the best chinese restaurant ever.never had a bad experience and i have been there 20 times now.super efficient and amazing food all the time.,5
"famous for its lovely dumplings. we didn't prebook and there was plenty of space. if you are after a huge plate of vegetarian noodles, ask as they are off menu and prepared specially. helpful staff, tap water offered with no fuss on a warm july evening. meal for two was 35. service included.",5
lovely food and good value for money in a great location.,5
i have eaten at my fair share of chinese restaurants and their egg fried rice with prawns was amazing. their dumplings were good too - i recommend the pan fried pork dumplings over the soupy ones.,5
"great service, warm and friendly staff, nothing to much trouble and explanation.  dumplings excellent as usual.",5
good standard dim sum. solid not spectacular.,4
wasn't disappointed but not wowed either. with every other restaurant in china town doing the same thing there is nothing to make it stand out.,3
"food was great! restaurant nice and bright, staff very pleasant",5
love the dumplings here. best in chinatown.,5
"easy chinese restaurant, tho really push to move customers through",4
"solid, traditional chinese. a good shout for china town",4
"friendly personnel, large portions food for a good price. dumplings weren't that great though",4
"delicious dumplings, busy restaurant but quick service",5
this is the one restaurant i return to time and time again. beautiful soup dumplings. staff are efficient but not personable. this is not something you should worry about as when you've queued for 30 mins to get a table you appreciate the efficiency of the place. service is charged on all tables. they served tap water. food is great.,5
daytime dumplings ok but not served in evening. bit of a rip off joint - the hurry you off the table and whack 12.5% service on the bill without asking. many much better places nearby,2
the staff are not friendly but the dumplings are so fresh and the food is damn tasty. a staple in chinatown and highly recommended,5
dumplings here are always supurb. they are handmade on sight. this is one of my favourite restaurants in london. highly recommend the xi long bao - soup dumplings,5
the food no so great! poor service and awkward atmosphere,3
"the staff where extremely rude. overpriced disgusting food and we where insulted by the staff. we eat out a lot and have never been so disappointed. we paid, but shouldnt have bothered.. rip off.. how they can get away with that type of behaviour and food is beyond me....",1
"staff are watching you all the time. considering they had over 10 waiters at once, it makes the atmosphere a bit uncomfortable. pls look into that otherwise, the dumplings were very nice. a bit pricey, but overall okay. bare in mind there is a minimum expenditure per person!",3
omg best chinese place about. food was amazing. you can bring your own alcohol too,5
"we come here every christmas and love the food. the dumplings were great, and the main course was equally tasty. be prepared to queue at times!",5
"the vegetarian menu was disgusting. really disappointed. i could have made nicer food at home. a lot of it was tasteless. fried spring rolls with no vegetables inside, boiled broccoli with some mushrooms on top. really don't know why it's so popular. will never come back if you paid me.",1
"very pleasant meal here with 4 others, sat up stairs. food arrived quickly. id recommend the set menu and some dim sum. good choice of beer and wine. and amazing a la cart menu as well. look forward to coming back. portions are big, so go hungry.",4
"our favourite place to visit when in london. our trip isn't complete unless we stop here. love the food, great value and fast service.",5
"good service. fabulous food, especially the dumplings. reasonably priced. lively atmosphere but not too noisy",5
we have long avoided this as it looked like a tourist trap but have been twice now and are hooked. prices slightly above average for chinatown but service is above average too. interior is well layed out and not as cramped as many of the other restaurants too. food was great which is always the key. will be back.,5
"dumplings' legend was recommended by a couple of friends, so we went there for lunch on a friday. the atmosphere was pleasant and service we extremely prompt; couldn't ask for much more. as for the food - sublime. some of the best dumplings i've ever had - and reasonably priced. an all round great experience.",4
superb food with very good servcie,5
winston and his staff are amazing.  thanks for the best food in uk outside of asia.robin lloyd,5
absolutely brilliant! great authentic experience.  the service is really quick and efficient.,5
"let's make one thing clear, these dumplings are not legendary. the other food we ordered was tasty hence the three stars but unfortunately we came for dumplings and were ultimately disappointed. i'd give this a miss if it's dumplings that you're after.",3
"one of my favourite chinese restaurants. pretty much everything i have had there was good, specially the dumplings and the green beans with mince pork and chili. the only thing i would complain about this place is the staff trying to kick you out even before you finished your food...",4
rude staff. disgusting food. they deserve to be bulldozed. worst meal of my life and expensive. when we complained we were answered abusively.,1
"food taste good, but customer service isn't the best part here.",3
quality dumplings with  wide variety of choice.recommend the spicy dumplings.,4
yummy. service is not very keen on helping you but the food is amazing. it can get very busy so just try it at odd hours.,4
"always busy so don't expect to be allowed to chill here for longer than it takes you to eat. however the food is excellent, such tasty fresh dim sum at a pretty good price (considering its location).",5
it was really good with a diverse menu. from spicy to sweet overall good food and really nice staff.,4
"favourite place, everything on the menu is amazing. spicy xiao long bao is incredible. accommodating to kids. prices are not that expensive!",5
"a tad disappointed given the excellent reviews. ordered a mixed platter of dumplings  but they were all prawn. ordered something else but wrong food came. then long delay for the right food, and very rushed service to get you to leave quickly so they can seat the next customers. when the right food did arrive, it was nice ",3
an excellent dumpling restaurant that is our favourite in china town. excellent quality with good prices.,5
i just love this place! not particularly fancy but love coming here with friends during a visit to london.,5
extremely rude staff. when we complained that there were no vegetables in the vegetable spring rolls the manager accused us of lying. complete rip off. unpleasant experience and expensive. they should be ashamed of their poor hospitality.,1
loved it!! went there with some friends and we had the most amazing buffet of dumplings! can't wait to go back!!,5
good selection of vegetarian dishes. got seated right away and we were 8. very quick service. vegetables seem very fresh and crunchy. not greasy as many other places. a bit on the expensive side thus one star off.,4
"good food, but how can they get away with such rude service! like another person already mentioned on the reviews, it's only acceptable because it's in chine town!so hospitality 1/5, food 4/5",3
"food is very good and cheap. unfortunately, the service is terrible",4
food was excellent and service was of good speed. a special big thank you to the owner / manager in the smart suit for being so accommodating and understanding!!,5
the food are wonderful,5
amazing dim sum,5
good to have this place in london,4
good dumplings but a long wait to be seated,4
amazing. absolutely love their soup dumplings.,5
"probably the best dumpling and dim-sum restaurant in london. a huge range of variety, good quality, always busy. a bit overpriced.",4
"great selection of vegetarian dumplings , buns and bao, probably the only place in the world where i have had vegetarian long bao and they were utterly delicious. a bit pricy and 12 percent service charge is applied. but you get a ten percent discount if you pay by cash. so thats nice",5
"speedy service, tasty food. great for a quick lunch in chinatown.",4
"great food, best friend rice",5
"must order the prawn dumpling, it is very delicious with thin skin and rich fillings (2 prawns in each dumpling). dont order the custard buns as they are even smaller than the dumplings.dont order porridge, as it is kinda plain.egg tarts not bad.yep basically all you need to order is dumplings.",4
"large and super quick turnaround time, more elegant than many other places, large tables available",4
"love the food here, a regular saturday lunch for me.only downside is sometimes the serving staff could be a bit better, but aside from that all good.",5
place is ok  great location,3
not bad!!! came for dim sum everything was good and fresh. the har gow stands out as is big and 'sooghn' if you speak cantonese means has that fresh crunch thing going on. noodles and rice were standard fare so suggest sticking to the  good value dim sum.  our service was fine but note we are a family that speaks cantonese and chinese!,4
our go to place for dim sumgreat service huge choice only criticism would be to allow more time to finish drinks and food before bringing bill.,5
"we had the xiao long bao, prawn cheng fun, xiu mai, and custard buns and enjoyed it all. xlbs were fantastic and the custard buns were probably some of my favorite ever. fast service and good prices. very extensive menu will make you come back to sample more.",5
"delicious siu long bao (soup dumplings). has the breezy, slightly impersonal air that many chinatown restaurants share, but it's good food served quickly and not too pricey",4
ok! i don't think i will go back.,2
"tasteless, unfriendly and overrated...by far. avoid, especially when surrounded by so many other better options.",1
the dumplings were sticky and the pastry very thick. they were not light or tasteful. would not recommend anyone to eat there,1
amazing soup filled dumplings,5
food was decent but service was quite rushed.,3
great food. staff is nice and happy to help. would definitely like to come again. dessert dimsums are delightfully light.,5
very good ratio quality/price. fast service.,5
went two night ago and service was excellent. went back today and were basically ignored while 5 staff members stood there doing nothing. walked out.,2
"busy, but did it's good, b and the staff are really friendly, would have supplied a picture but we ate everything ",5
highly recommend dumplings' legend. especially the spicy pork long bao.,5
"lovely food and the service was fast. they need to improve customer service by smiling once in a while and not hurrying people out. that said, i'll go again!",4
amazing food great service,5
awesome dim sum. can't wait to come back,5
great set menu. very delicious. super fast service.,5
amazing dumplings!! with delicious feeling inside it was meat and bulion melting in your mouth.. good price for such a nice restaurant in the middle of china town.,5
totally overpriced for what you get. service is rude and only focuses on making profit. we were provided with the bill right after we were done with our main course. the atmosphere has a really cheap impression and the food quality (especially the dumplings / baozi) has been a disappointment. definitely cant recommend!,2
"ignore the other reviews, take it from somebody who spends alot of time in china town - this is one of the best. get a load of dim sum and definitely make sure to have the schzchuan wonton.",5
food was good and reasonably priced. service was a bit slowwe had to get the staffs attention anytime we needed anything.,4
dim sum was fresh. king prawns were lovely. totally worth the price i paid.,5
dumpling  good not worth the wait but if i were in area and there was no queue would get again :),3
siaow loong dumplings and volcano signature custard buns worth a try,4
very rude restaurant.dont go here.much better in the area.,1
"a nice spacious place with friendly staff. good food, but a bit overprised. they were a bit eager to get rid of us after finishing the meal though!",4
the food is amazing. so delicious and fresh! we will be back.,5
dim sum was decent but the service is poor. however when you come to china town you don't go for the service so would recommend. xiao long bao were soupy and the spicy duck dumplings were good too,3
"the soup dumplings was ok, the dumpling dough was too thick so it takes away the taste of the broth and meat. the giant soup dumpling was disappointing, it was just dough with soup, the meat was almost non-existant. the service is quick and good and the dim sum shrimp dumpling was very good, big shrimp portion!",3
wonderful fresh dumplings are made there!,4
place was dirty and the food quality could be improved,1
perfect stone bowl full of premium seafood & silken tofu!! love it. soup dumplings are very cool:)),5
decent dim sum if you are around chinatown area. as good as it gets in london,5
perfectly prepared and seasoned food at reasonable prices. amazing bao!,5
excellent and friendly service. prince of wales and camilla ate there in 2018! wow what a recommendation. see photo on their wall.,5
nice food chinese!!,4
best soup dumplings ever!!! make sure to make reservations and make sure to have enough time to taste all the delicious dumplings they freshly make on site! the soup dumplings were a great discovery!,5
excellent service. great food. well priced. lovely selection,5
great food and it's open till late night early morning,4
great customer service and good food but a bit on the pricey side,4
"quick service, quality and selection excellent, staff were friendly and helpful..",4
food was good. the waiters were really rude.,3
"i'd give it more, the food was pretty good but to presume the tip is compulsory is wrong.",1
"excellent chinese cuisine, enjoyed the lobster & dumpling dish. we had our dinner in a private room. the restaurant was very busy due to eve of chinese new year",5
there are many places around this one that are similar. i am glad we chose to go here. everything i ate here was awesome. staff was on point. excellent.,5
"they have the funniest, most beautiful fishes! you can find them as you go upstairs. food was good, though the duck arrived at the table rather cold, so we had to ask them to reheat it.",4
great place to find the touch of cantonese food inside chinatown.,5
"fresh, delicious food  and fast service.",5
"great dim sum! went at noon on a saturday, we were seated immediately. when we left about an hour later there was already a small queue",5
"amazing dumplings, great service, extensive menu, buzzing atmosphere",5
fantastic dumplings. nice touch is that you can actually see them being made. try the fresh crab roe which is #1 on the dumpling menu.. delicious !,4
"the food was decent, but when i orderd soft drinks they came luke warm, and when i asked them to bring me some that was cold they said that they didn't have any. the place is also way too loud and the staff is not very polite.",2
the place for delicious long bao,5
"fantastic dumplings, fast and friendly service.",5
"the steamed dumplings were pretty scheisse and the ""fried"" rice should've actually been fried. also, the chicken with pineapple seemed to be lacking the named pineapple, but the dim sum and the duck wraps were satisfactory.",2
great dim sum. i love the xiu long bao! the overall atmosphere is a bit sterile.,4
"hecking good, been here several times",5
"a very good first experience.highly recommended.+reasonable prices.+efficient staff.-staff rushing you to order, eat, pay the bill and leave.",4
nice dumplings. service is brisk and not with a smile. would go back for dumplings though.,3
great place with large variety,5
friendly and efficient service. the food was delicious,4
fabulous service and the best dumplings i've had outside asia!,5
bloody beautiful food!!! love this place,5
great food and quick service,5
enormous overwhelming menu.  ordered the soup dumplings the crispy duck appetizer with scallions. spicy spinach with ground pork which was actually a chinese green vegetable.  all yummy!  i'm stuffed!,4
very nice chinese restaurant! reasonable prices and fast service.,4
the waiter who is a black man of medium height wearing glasses beated customers and the manager did not care. we have called and reported this online to the police. do not go to this resturant.,1
"i enjoyed the 1/4 crispy duck, crystal prawn dumpling and spicy xiao long bao for 2 people. service and food was quick and enjoyable. i especially enjoyed the crystal dumping which was much bigger than at other restaurants",4
"incredible dim sum, incredible drinks, and incredible staff.",5
probably the best dim sum in chinatown,5
"the only 1 handmade traditional dumplings in london, the best dumpling in london area.",5
"great restaurant, they're food is tasty & dumplings are fresh. however they rush you on the weekends because it's so busy. bring people to the table before you've even put on your coat. did it to people on the table next to us and the tried to do it to us also, didn't like that at all.",4
best dim sum in london ! th xiao long bao are just super and the honey barbecues pork stuff is a amazing good,5
"delicious food and fast service. the dumplings are delicious but the other food is also great. you can see the dumplings being made by their cooks as you enter the restaurant. the staff were friendly and very accommodating, especially considering it was a very busy day and we were with a baby and pram.",5
poor quality food and poor service too :(,2
the best dumplings in london always busy but quick service,5
very good chinese food,5
"nice dumpling experience in chinatown. crowded but friendly fast and efficient service, price range a bit more expensive than other chinese restaurants offering dumplings in the area but they discount you 10% if you pay in cash. i would definitely go back for those fresh dumplings and the tasty fried rice. recommended",4
"good dumplings, but a bit overrated",3
great food at really good prices - always a safe bet in china town.,5
"in a dilemma to give 5 or 4 stars. it could be judged as good due to the fact that it is located in the uk. could have been better i think, especially if they could serve it with sweet sauce and chilli sauce, like how the authentic hong kong's dim sum is.",4
amazing food and immaculate service! will definitely visit again.,5
they serve good dumplings,4
dumplings are freshly made and you can taste it. recommended,5
incredible xiao long bao,5
"very good food, very quick service",5
"highly recommend. fast service, friendly  and very good food.",4
"great chinese food all round, the soup dumplings obviously a speciality, but all the classics we tried were very tasty. not overpriced. have heard stories of poor service but it was ok when we went. went as part of a birthday party, two large tables of 10, and they coped pretty well.",4
"delicious food,  great service,  all the wow without pretentious stuff.",5
delish roast meats.,5
we enjoyed the food here but the service was a bit of a let down. we had to wait ages for our dim sum order and then we were rushed to order more dishes within our alotted time frame. recommend knowing what you want before you arrive as it is not a relaxed experience. dim sum platter was definitely the best dish.,3
one of the best in china town. wicked food for a good price. although a little impersonal. they want you out as quick as possible to get the next guy in. would have been good to chill with a beer after!,4
"great food.  tried something for the first time, soup in a dumpling. had lots of dumplings in soup before so it was interesting the other way around.busy place but food comes quickly.",5
great traditional dumplings.,5
avoid at all cost. very expensive but low-quality dishes. ordered the fish with pickled veggie and fish was absolutely not fresh to a point that it made me gag. the pork used in the dishes and soup dumplings is also not fresh. overall a very expensive but miserable experience.,1
service was fast and good. food nothing special. given the name i would expect a larger dim sum offer. dim sum we tasted was good though but the duck was the driest i ve ever had. even my partner comented how much better is the one i buy to roast at home (it comes within a kit with pancakes and hoisin sauce for about 6 pounds!).,2
"we visit about twice a year. love the food. quick visit today for dim sum and tea. service never overly friendly, but in my experience straightforward and professional. thoroughly reccomended.",5
1 - for fast service2 - for portion size3 - opening hours4 - friendliness,4
"good food, the staff were professional and the toilets were very clean. worth visiting.",4
friendly staff and great authentic food. would highly recommend the sichuan chicken and spicy beef noodle soup. perfect crispy duck and tasty tom yum. would love to eat here again!,5
"great food! authentic taste, service can be better, but let's be honest: if the food is that good, i'm willing to compromise on service.",5
"we went there for dinner last night and it was really disappointing, mediocre chinese food / dim sum served by rude staff. one family had a major argument with one of the waitress as she was extremely rude! the atmosphere is not nice, i think they are serving for tourists, who will never return, rather than londoners!",1
can't beat it for a late night chinese craving. service was efficient and friendly and the dumplings were fantastic.,4
"for a dumpling restaurant, there are very few dumplings to choose from.mixed platter was just a selection of prawn served in different shaped dumplings. fun atmosphere. lovely security guard.",3
"i have a european pallette, but i ordered one of their ""must try"" items and regretted it.",1
my favourite restaurant in london. great food great service.,5
"sorry it's awful. the only reason i give 2 stars not 1 is becuz its london. if the restaurant is in asia, not even close to 1 star.the cabbage with chili and vinegar, sweet and sour pork ribs and glass noodle....these three dishes....i can only say...i'll kill myself if i were you.soooo disappointed. also the service, horrible.",2
"soooooo disgusting, for the food, and also for the service,especially the boss.not recommend for anyone",1
i have been here 4 times! and i met zhang hanyu here once! good place!,5
"tried the nice-boxes hotspot, very spicy but tasty",5
excellent food!,5
i have eaten here a number of times now and have enjoyed it on each occasion. i love spicy sichuan cooking and the food here really hits the mark. the service is warm and friendly and the prices are reasonable. i will definitely return.,5
"we were there on a monday night and the place was pretty full after 8pm.  it didn't look like many were tourists. the menu is too large to do more than sample in one go, but that's part of the fun.  good ma po.  large portions.  will likely go back if i'm in the area.",4
"brilliant - amazing spicy dishes and a really adventurous menu. lovely, sleepy atmosphere - especially deep into the back of the restaurant, a very cool place.quite expensive and they tried to add service on card when they'd already slapped it on the bill - cheeky cheeky, so lose a star for that.",4
"this restaurant is fantastic, love the decor. we enjoyed the food, very tasty and some great spicy dishes #hotpot #sichuanfood",5
excellent sichuan food. cannot complain about that. why not 5 stars? they charge 12.5% service charge automatically and then sneak in an optional tip when you pay by card... not cool,4
"genuine and very tasty sichuan food. if you thought chinese food is cannot be spicy, come here. great dishes, menu offers a very nice picked selection.",5
good food. just refurbished and modernised,5
"the spicy spare rib noodle soup is great, better than what i expected,  recommend!",5
"the hot pot was pretty good, go for the spicy one.",5
crispy duck recomendable. spactacle for chinese new year celebration included.,5
"er mei has become a tradition for me and my boyfriend and we're trying to come at least monthly, when we start missing the taste. everytime we say we'll try something different but we end up having the same dishes because they're too delicious. i also love the changes in the menu and decoration. good job guys. keep it up ",5
three stars doesn't do this place justice. this food is killer as long as you like a bit of spice in your life.,5
the worst experience in my life . the woman in pink was so rude...  i would not recommend to anyone to go and waste your money and time,1
"delicious food, and excellent service. a short wait for a table was well worth it. so glad we waited. (10 -15 min)",5
"for szechuan hotpot and boiled beef, the best place in london. my first choice for hot and spicy in china town",5
vary tasty food. good restaurant. staff is very kind and available.,5
"this one's my favourite place in london. we go there once or twice a month because it's a bit pricey but the food is delicious and the staff is amazingly friendly, something rare in london. great work, guys. ",5
the food is just so so and doesn't match the price they charge for it. the staff in the restaurant is really snobbish. will never go back again.,1
very delicious food and good service. authentic chinese dishes. must try.,5
really superb food served in very pleasant surroundings. very much not your cheap and cheerful average chinese restaurant. we both love sichuan food and paid a visit late one evening. will come back soon. highly recommend.,5
nice food and price.,4
"this restaurant is so gross, the onwer has 2 menus with same dishes but different prices. they would offer the cheaper menu when you order, and show another menu when you pay the bill",1
"very good for the price. quite authentic cuisine. only let down was the staff's lack of english + quite important when serving authentic dishes which are not standard.overall, highly recommended.",4
i really enjoyed my experience here tonight. the staff was very helpful and tried very hard to make sure everything was just right. i loved all the spicy flavours & the twice cooked pork belly with outstanding. . everything was very fresh. it is very easy to find just off of the main through fair. it has easy handicapped access.,5
taste is fairly authentic to sichuan food. make sure you like spicy stuff before going.,4
"fairly cool and stylish bar, but overpriced. 71 for round of five g&ts. doorman accused me of ""dancing"" and told me to leave. very rude. wouldn't go back.",2
amazing drinks! difficult to get a good spot. ,4
"meh. over sugared, over hyped. there are much better options for a good cocktail.",2
name is misleading. not experimental.,2
food was not worth the money,2
"delicious cocktails, great view, unpretentious and friendly staff and the music was ace (funk, bit of latin, funk and more funk)",5
great bar with amaizing artisan cocktails! nice atmosphere with very good service ! good is music and relaxing. this is a good choice  if you are looking for high quality drinks and cocktails in the heart of chinatown.,5
you'd never imagine that place is hidden there. the view and the atmosphere is the perfect scenario for a date. the staff is so cool and will definetly help you to choose a suitable cocktail for you.,4
this place is very small and just okay. dj was good.,3
a place to go for new cocktails experience...,5
nice cocktails n ambiance,4
"superb secret bar, exceptional cocktails in china town. conspiratorial, speak easy vibe.",5
change your staff.,1
hidden gem. cocktails are fantastic.,5
"best cocktail bar in london, amazing drinks! kim always made my visit excellent!",5
staff are rude and insulating. someone gave their name as errold as opposed to their actual french name which was rude and unwarranted. would not visit again,1
hidden top place,5
"experimental cocktail doesn't mean it's good, be careful when ordering food, some of the portion are not the same size as said on the menu and even after complaining they will still charge you service charge",2
"loud, nowhere to sit, crowded, good cocktails not not amazing",4
excellent atmosphere coupled with excellent drinks & service,5
delicious cocktails in a fun venue,5
good cocktails. price is in line with other high end cocktail bars. staff (at least those i have encountered in my two visits)  let the place down. all the decor in the world won't atone for bad service. ruins the ambience. certainly a missed opportunity...better service and this place would be awesome.,3
definitely gone down in quality. which is a shame. but lots of good new bars in soho.,1
atmosphere is amazing really nice staff and drinks!,5
speak-easy style venue. a narrow house full of winding stairwells and nook like comfortable seats. usually crowded and full of dance music and people standing around.vibe is probably hip rather that suave. the music and dj seem quit loud given the fact it is not a dancing place. drinks averaging 10-20 pounds + table service.,3
great vibe and cocktails.,5
great,5
great atmosphere and vibe,4
"great hidden speak easy on 2 floors with a recognized cocktail ""savoir faire"". easy music to keep the speak easy vibe on",4
"probably the worst cocktails ive ever had, all 4 of us had different ones and none of them were nice",1
"one of the best cocktail bars ive ever been to. great cocktails, great music. a bit dear.",5
"great atmosphere and novel cocktails. music was a bit too loud for me to recommend it as a first date venue, but the ""in the know"" style makes it one to keep up your sleeve.",5
"great hidden cocktail bar, quality bartender and super service!",5
good cocktail and if you like to be seated with strangers in the dark go for it!,3
great tasting cocktails at reasonable prices for london. brilliant atmosphere and was a perfect place to start my friends hen night!,5
was good.,3
very rude staff. not worth it.,1
"the best cocktail bar in the world. (if you can find it!)i absolutely love this place, and will come every time i go to london.",5
this place remind me many memorable nights. the bar is set on two floors with vintage decor. the selection of vintage cocktails and own creations are regularly updated. great place to finish the evening.,5
best most delicious cocktails in this area you just have to book or sneak in an early table!,5
"we wanted to have few cocktails, but alas, door staff refused entry and were fairly rude about it. no worries, it's london, so we went to mr foggs - doorman was very welcoming and we had an amazing time there. avoid this place - go to mr foggs.",1
"no! it's not a brothel through that door, it's a great cocktail bar. different menu every time you visit. good value too. not too busy.",5
decent place with great location in chinatown. i little difficult to fine but i suppose that's part of the appeal. staff and service where both great but the cocktails where a little disappointing. by no means bad but i have had better for the price. will go back as the place is nice.,4
great cockatils ans atmosphere,5
the place itself is just staircase converted into something called bar. quite dark and loud inside. quality and quantity of drinks is low. not much space inside. i can't really think about any pros of that place.,1
"drinks are certainly creative but i wasnt that keen, and the prices are very steep",3
the door staff would not let me in because i had pride sequins on.  on pride day in soho. was told to wash my face before i could go in. they dont want to associate with pride. really in soho on pride day. you should be embracing pride. i have been before on two occasions. needless to say i wont be going again.,1
"great cocktails and nice decor, but very crowded and noisy. not the classic speakeasy atmosphere",4
"tasty and unique cocktails, accommodating service, speakeasy atmosphere, dimly lit, each table has its own air of privacy. a nice place to unwind for a late night drink, but not the place to be if you're wanting to be loud or on your phone. i'm told they're open til 3am most nights. ",5
don't bother turning up without reservation. the door staff is super uptight and borderline rude. the have some tasty cocktails here. i have had pretty good fun times with my mates whenever i've been here. staff are friendly and happy to help decide on drinks. they do also go off menu.,4
"awful employees!they will make a mistake on your drink. rather than apologise and excuse the very loud music as an understandable reason, they get upset with you and insist that you pay for whatever they made. never go unless you want to deal with very snooty, snobby spoiled brats as your bartenders.",2
"i like the bar, they do very good drinks in a cool atmosphere. it is hard to get in; there's rarely space for walk-ins (so book ahead if possible) and the door is not obvious (but that just adds to the charm). overall i like it, just been turned away a few times too many!...maybe i should book...but spontaneity is more fun!",4
"this is a fun place to check out.  the cocktails are bizarre, sometimes in a great way, sometimes in a not good way, but for me, that's part of the fun.  you wont find drinks like this anywhere else!  i would have given 5 stars, but i think the staff could have been friendlier.",4
nice and hidden! a bit pricey though,3
love this little hidden away bar. very small and cosy with unique cocktails,5
"we only had the cocktails here and they tasted great. the service was really good. the entrance was so hard to identify that we walked past it twice. its in between 2 chinese restaurants in chinatown. i cant say for anything else on the menu but based on what we had and the atmosphere, i give it 5 stars.",5
"so beautiful and atmospheric. if you can find it and you like a good cocktail, and don't mind paying a bit more for it, i highly recommend it. the staff are so attentive and the music was great.",5
was so drunk cant remember it! must have been brilliant,5
"rocked up last night to a little tiny door with bouncers who just acted like we were dirt and had some of the worst interpersonal skills i've ever seen, even for bouncers. 5 entry to a cocktail bar where all you can see is an ugly door and two rude bouncers on the door. there's better places locally.",1
"well theres a surprise! a two storey cocktail bar tucked away behind a very small door! a wide range of cocktails make it up or off the menu, you choose! upper floor is quieter than lower. two bars, one on each floor, so service is excellent throughout. usual london prices.",5
"exciting, tranquil and ethnic cocktail bar. sublime experimentation which leads to some world class cocktails. great atmosphere and bar staff was brilliant. one girl with blonde hair in particular made the night for us. door staff were a bit up themselves which is a shame but i guess that's why they work on the door....  ;)",5
"excellent service, excellent drinks, excellent ambience, excellent live music.",5
"cocktails are good once you get them. not that they took long to come once ordered but ordering in the first place was a bit of a struggle. all the food we also ordered came as we were about to leave a good hour and a half later, though it was tasty. just need a few more staff members.",3
"such a great find, well hidden!!",5
i really enjoy the athmosphere. cocktails were top too,5
cocktails are a little out there for my taste. very hidden location,3
excellent service and great quality,5
"they accept walk-ins but after 5 minutes they kick you out because they need the table for a reservation. the cocktails are just okay, nothing of experimental",1
wonderful hidden place ,5
overpriced and tried to charge me for more drinks than id had. i tried to be reasonable but they wouldnt have it. no semblance of customer service. dont bother.,1
clever cocktails and a lovely atmosphere.,5
expensive for what they serve. nice music,3
"cocktails are surprisingly good, better than average. nice environment to talk and feel the music. i cannot make sense of the 5 pounds entrance fee though, kind of off putting.",4
the staff here are incredibly helpful and i love that the cloak room is free. the cocktail list is not massive but it is imaginative and well thought through.  i don't think there is a single cocktail i could recreate at home. well worth a visit - if you can find it!!!,5
the staff were pretty rude and the music was so loud i had to communicate with my friends by whatsapp,1
amazing atmosphere,5
"cocktail is just basic, prices are the way more exspensive with what you got! not really recomended. visiting at night just aware for extra charge.",3
"really great bar, with nice drinks and atmosphere. however, it may be difficult to come in .",5
"great atmosphere and cocktails.  candlelit bar over 2 floors with a 30s vibe. stockholm syndrome, le montrose, smoke the rhino all v interesting. expensive but worth it. ",4
"always good service here. this speakeasy is hidden behind a door in chinatown, located in the basement. this is your classic speakeasy.",5
"a secret place in dark atmosphere , nice old fashioned furniture with drinks that change in taste while drinking them. ",4
a slightly different scene then i'm used to but amazing drinks and friendly staff.,4
one of the best hidden bars in london.  cocktails are original but very pricy,5
great for good cocktail and quiet atmosphere but very few seats,3
decent joint but their cocktails are not to my taste.,3
fun,5
unfriendliest staff ive ever seen ... except the doormen and barkeeper.,1
brilliant cocktails in a very exciting venue,5
great cocktails and fun speakeasy vibe,4
a great gem if you can find it! ,5
"very similar to opium in terms of cocktails, price and location.if you like opium, you would like it here.",4
i was quite unimpressed by this place. the ambiance was good but the doorman was really really rude - not what you expect from a place at this price point. ,1
it's going from great to meh... some of their best bartenders left.,4
showed up on a friday evening only to be turned away by the doorman,1
"cool, soho hideout. cocktails are amazing !!!",5
bouncers are arrogant and rude. shame.,1
experimental cocktail club (or ecc) is a hidden cocktail bar in chinatown on gerrard street with great cocktails and service.,4
great service and a great find. though a little pricy and the cocktails are a bit on the small side. but unique ambiance and location.,4
"nice drinks, getting in can sometimes be a bit of a mystery but i am yet to have been turned away - perhaps simply down to good timing. nice cocktails but quite pricey and very busy and cramped seating.",3
love the cocktails and the environment!,5
a very busy place on especially on we with a youngish crowd. good atmosphere with a wide range of choice for cocktails.,3
expensive but good fun and great cocktails.,5
sophisticated cocktails. best to book to get good seats. a bit tight otherwise.,4
"a bit difficult to find, the doorman has a children's colorbook and stands in front of the building door. the place is tiny so book ahead. the cocktails are all yummy!",5
"great place to go have a cocktail in an upscale, speak-easy setting",5
"cocktails did not disappoint. staff were friendly, service was prompt, and the atmosphere was great!",5
nice cocktail bar hidden in between two restaurants on china town. managed to get a table without a reservation despite was some other reviews suggest. ,4
nice cocktail.,4
"decent cocktails, a bit cramped",3
"crowded, expensive with a well dressed touristy vibe. cocktails are delicious and service is pretty efficient.",3
excellent little cocktail bar in soho,4
bit tacky. way too dark inside. friendly staff. gets crowded pretty quick. not many seating available. reserving in advance a wise thing to do. ,3
average cocktail bar charging double as you'd pay at club49 just around the corner ( way better venue ),2
"blink and you'll miss it, hidden behind an unmarked door-ecc is a charming gem in the heart of london.  amazing drinks selection and bartenders are very attentive & helpful-will accomodate to needs easily.  def recommend!",4
great hidden spot,5
great drinks and a fun vibe,5
"nice place, service is really bad, such a shame because all other eccs ive been to are amazing",1
secret and late night great,5
this is a nice club although i like the location in paris better,5
"great cocktails in a classy bar, but it get packed very easily so that it's hard to find a table after 11.",3
my favourite bar in soho! i love the cocktails and dcor set in the prohibition theme,5
mezcal coffee bean drink was excellent. nice atmosphere but mixed on staff.  ,4
"good drinks but it's absolutely crowded always, not your place if you are looking to sit down and have a conversation.",4
"nice cocktails but pricy, about $12-20 each. excellent service and friendly staff. cozy but loud music.",4
this hidden cocktail bar is dipped in depth. amazing made cocktails and awesome vibes ,5
hidden behind an anonymous doorway on gerrard street. great cocktails. friendly staff. ,4
"high quality drinks in a very small place, so be prepared to get closer to whoever you are going with!",4
"nice and creative cocktail, although seating arrangement can be more comfortable",4
"staff are rude, space is limited, expensive... cocktails are nice but over priced. not somewhere to revisit and if you have not been save your money.",1
"not the most friendly or welcoming door in london, but the cocktails are excellent. try stockholm syndrome!",4
"great secret, gorgeous cocktails. ",4
very cool place with nice cocktails,5
great cocktails using house infusions ,5
one of the nicest places for cocktails in central london,5
quirky bar with exellent cocktails,4
great drinks but difficult to get in,4
"poor cocktails, expensive drinks and entry fee. not coming back.",1
"hidden gem, nice private cocktail bar little pricey but worth it",5
no issues with door staff if you bring girl dem,4
excellent cocktails,5
"try and find it! i've been here a few times and i still struggle to find it, but it's worth it once you get in!!",4
nice cocktails and service but small,3
"inventive cocktails in a chic, unexpected locale",5
"super tasty cocktails, pretty expensive, but maybe worth it. ",5
ok cocktails in a cramped and very loud environment.,2
"good cocktails, placed not too crowded even a friday evening, a bit too noisy and expensive.",4
"excellent cocktails, reservations needed",4
fantastic the best  luv the place ,5
"the 50 we had to 'donate' to the bouncer to let is in was not worth it, even though the cocktails were good.",1
"cool cocktail bar, nice hidden spot",5
excellent plae and  retro atmosphere,4
"extremely rude and arrogant door staff, ruined our experience. will most certainly never go here again.",1
"expensive,  but worth it.",4
"encountered the obnoxious doorman mentioned below, no complaint on the staff inside but his behaviour both arguing with the staff and then us on our exit was not a pleasant experience ",1
"very trendy, good drinks",4
genuinely interesting and delicious cocktails,5
"cocktails ok, horrible cheese platter. bar staff not that nice.....",2
absolute cool,5
"nice atmosphere, too cosy to be comfortable ",4
you should experiment with changing the door man. what a joke of a man. ,1
average and overhyped probably because of the location. 13 pounds for a cocktail... interior design was nice though.,2
"extremely nice door staff , he is very handsome and nice .",1
"great cocktails, great atmosphere.. i feel the staff became not so nice lately though. ",4
cocktails are very good. i've heard they can be a bit arsy on the door though.,4
great drinks and music!,5
"the whole package, must-do. ",5
great experience and great cocktails!,5
"my spot for the whole summer, happy times",5
there are no signs at the entrance! be careful you don't miss it!,5
"great bar great drinks, just be nice to the door man ",5
it's grim,1
"great bar, great service and awesome drinks. ",5
"great atmosphere, great music, simple selection of high quality cocktails paired with side food. must see.",5
"real effort to get past the door staff. attempted to make a reservation a few weeks beforehand. no reply after 3 chases.4th chase, was told no reservations taken on a saturday. show up to be told by unpleasant door staff that we must have a reservation. not for want of trying lol!",1
"cozy atmosphere, good drinks!",5
expensive but really good cocktails. very crowded on friday night but friendly staff and good vibe. ,3
not bad at all but a bit overpriced!,3
wicked,5
"speakeasy with nice cocktails, shame about the rude service",1
"i went on a saturday night so it was the typical crowded west end vibe. artisan drinks - all ice no liquor.  not enough seating.  however, table service is provided if you do get a table and there's a free clock room.",1
"great cocktails and amazing atmosphere. however, it is usually hard to get in without reservations!",4
always a treat to drink here. cocktails are the best.,4
"great cocktails, a little pricey ",4
"turned away at the door on a wednesday evening around 11pm, no questions asked. despite the website stating 5 cover, there is no reasoning to be had, nor favors to be won.  as a single individual, surely there was room for one person, given that the website states 50% is held for walk-ins.",1
"rude door staff, delicious, but overpriced drinks. ",2
excellent. thank you to every one there. ,5
"love the theme they went for, as if gatsby meets grand budapest hotel. something charming about the place. goo cocktails but a little cramped. think the whole 'secret' thing is overdone with a scary man at the door. i would expect more exclusivity when you enter.would go back though!",3
ridiculous prices,1
always a safe haven for great drinks.,5
out this world cocktails and service,5
try spotting the entrance first time round... all very secretive and exclusive. great cocktails and sophisticated atmosphere. you get what you pay for...,5
the best cocktails we had while visiting london! this hip bar feels like a cool speakeasy. i would strongly recommend the experimental cocktail club for a post show drink (near theater district). ,5
loooooovvvvveeeeeeeee,5
behind an unmarked door you find one of the best cocktail bars in london. busy on peak days but if you go at a less conventional time you'll find it very relaxing and a fantastic place to enjoy amazing cocktails and chat the afternoon/evening away.,5
"you have to know what you are looking for, otherwise you won't find it. inside it is stylish and across the different floor you'll find a spot to sit. staff is very knowledgeable and cocktails are 5*, but maybe just slightly overpriced. but it'd definitely go back",4
"they know their cocktails, and if you ask for a classic that's not on the menu they will make it. i recommend an old fashioned! it's a bit pricey but well worth it. look for a bouncer in front of an unmarked brown door next to the four seasons, a hidden gem in chinatown!",5
"i like that ecc is hidden in the middle of chinatown, where you would least expect such an establishment. from my experience it's fairly easy to get in on weekends too, if you're a group of 2-4 people. i've been to this place at least three times, and cocktails are consistently excellent, albeit over-priced for what you get. ",3
"nice ""hidden"" bar in a speakeasy style decor. great selection of cocktails, with a combination of both good classics and inventive house cocktails. all cocktails ordered were very nice, however they are a bit pricey.",4
"this has a bit of a 'secret door' vibe as there's no exterior signage.  instead you need to 'find' the doorman and have him let you in.  cocktails were fantastic, but the interior was a bit dated.  i'd go back, but i wouldn't mark it a must-do.",4
quite pretty inside and possibly better than milk and honey in that regard. cocktails also tend to be yummy and feel like they've been delicately prepared. however the novelty seems to outweigh the actual overall experience. the door staff can be unfriendly and rude and the cocktails aren't quite worth the hype. ,3
it's a bit of an adventure to find this small unmarked door along gerrad street but negotiate your way past the guarded door and you'll find two floors of a great speaking easy style bar. the cocktails are finely crafted and there's usually some decent music being played further upstairs. good fun and a nice place to bring friends. ,4
"06.11.2018: good cocktails, but worst service ever! super unfreindly, would not recommend to go there!",1
"great place to kick in a party, with fairly good cocktails. expect a lot of people, loud house and electronic music and just a few tables. ordering can be challenging. rated three since they charged us 5 to go in and cocktails are 11 average, hence not that cheap.",3
"pretty good and not much to fault although, a bit small and pricey.",4
"nicely surprised, not cheap but decent drinks",4
great cocktail bar with a really cool opium den vibe interior. the service was great and the cocktails where made with real care and attention to detail. i will 100% be coming back again.,4
"some of the best cocktails i've ever had in london, which is saying something as i drink a lot of cocktails in london! don't be intimidated by the shabby doorway, the staff are friendly and the decor is beautiful. definitely worth a visit for a treat or celebration! ",5
cute speakeasy tucked away in chinatown.,5
"from the random doorman outside the small unremarkable door to the dark insides this place oozes charm and it finds a good crowd with the young and well-dressed. one thing to watch out for with this ""mystery"" place is the high prices! the strong drinks probably make up for it in this regard however. ",3
"ive been going to this place for years. but now the novelty has worn out. also they discriminate. i was outside queueing, they turned away a older couple, they said sorry we are very busy, then two minutes later they let me and my friend in. absolutely out of order.",1
"not so secret anymore, but still thoroughly enjoyable.",5
great place for a few cocktails.  so many unique  drinks on the menu.  service was really good as well.,5
"speak easy style bar. no jazz in site. cover charge to get in, absorbitantly expensive drinks. rude door staff. some of the wait staff were perfunctory. it was absolutely rammed.",2
great music and cocktails. great place for an intimate night out,5
felt rushed even ordering a bottle of champagne as they wanted to turn tables quickly on a saturday night,2
delicious cocktails. try the one with pandan leaves...,5
"best laphroaig old fashioned: ""sky is the limit""",5
"excellent cocktails, worth the money. reservation essential.",4
"cocktails were very poor and while waiting for me to finish me drink my mate ordered a quick beer, that set him back 7!! and a i had a broken chair ",1
"nice looking place and friendly staff, but the menu (refreshed daily mind) was rather simple and a bit disappointing for a specialist cocktail place - not experimental at all!",4
"great drinks, the atmosphere was slightly peculiar but after a few of their delicious cocktails i didn't care. we will return when we're next in the area",4
excellent drinks. can be packed at time. large groups difficult to get in.,5
"cool drinks, cool place, 101% suggested! crowded on saturdays!",5
"extremely rude door staff.  would not myself and a friend into the bar,  with no valid explanation ,  my friend was black. i have entered the bar previously,  but will not return to bar with what i can only assume are racist door staff.  avoid. ",1
great cocktails. place is rather small and can feel crowded. overall a good experience and would go again for a drink,4
"very cool bar, very hidden away in chinatown. quite a struggle to find it which was half the fun! ",5
it's ok. very odd door to get into the place with some guy waiting outside for customers. very expensive drinks! other than that it's ok.,3
"great cocktail bar! intimate, friendly atmosphere, good music & top notch drinks. bar manager wilson & his staff were all excellent. highly recommend epp. ",5
really cool atmosphere and interesting drinks. when we were leaving they were just setting up a place for live music - very nice!,4
decent cocktaillist,4
"the way they make the cocktails is a work of art! a little more lenient than your typical speakeasy, so it gets a bit crowded. but the drinks were super tasty and worth the only slightly premium price tag.",5
"love the idea of a speakeasy that's difficult to find, but when asked where we would like to sit, we were then told where we could actually sit.... and the cocktail that was recommended by staff as being sweet was actually quite a bitter, coffee tasting cocktail... very expensive for what it was!",3
"unexpected trendy bar, right at the heart of chinatown. look for an inconspicuous door that's under guard by 1-2 bouncers. the bar is split over two floors, can get very busy and drinks don't come cheap, but hey it's a hidden bar on top of chinatown - so it's worth it.",4
"i love this place. does get too busy on friday evening and weekends, but on a quieter weekday, it's perfect. ",5
"quite hard to get into, bouncers only allow in couples. once in, it's cosy and drinks were lovely but expensive. atmosphere is good but be prepared to have to talk quite loudly. ",4
the cocktails being expensive is expected. the small bar is best visited on one of the quieter nights to avoid loud music and consequently able to have a conversation.,4
"very rude doorman, let a couple in before us without asking them for a reservation yet asked us if we had one, which we did.  then when we got up to the bar and the same couple are on our table!!  drinks were good but this place is not worth the hassle or hype, will not be coming back here again.",2
"terrible,was expecting a better service from a place pricing itself to be a well to do establishment. was not allowed to sit together as a group of people due to some silly policies... rude staff ",1
"host just decided to randomly  charge entrance fee. when asked why, he decided that people are not worth respond and asked next people in queue to come in. i was a regular client and i am never coming here again... poor poor service...",1
great cocktails in a private and discreet bar with a classy ambiance. i liked the la medicacion and the get the buck in here drinks. it gets crowded after 1230. ,4
very average drinks and then charged the optional 12.5% gratuity. youve gotta do much better if youre going to call yourself a cocktail bar.,1
nice but super expensive!,4
"things we are get used to since we were young. if you would like to go back in the oast, please come. also there some new things.",5
always great at 2am.. enough said,4
"love the food, staff very friendly, the best in china town!",5
"the bakery is the best value, the dim sum isn't anything spectacular and the chilli oil tasted old. the toilet wasn't maintained - there was pee all over the seat and the floor and there was no soap, makes you worry that the kitchen is equally overlooked.",2
as authentic as you are likely to get for the price. average fodder of the shanghai variety,3
"service is typical chinese, fast, efficient, no frills. we enjoyed dim sum, vegetable noodles and took home a box of tasty baked good, red bean sesame buns and sponge cake. delicious for breakfast the next day.",5
such disappointment! the noodles were so plain. it was not worth my money.,1
"decent bakery, loved the flavours.",5
had the fried rice noodles and it reminded me of home.,5
best eat,5
"tea ist nice.lady,s nice...snacks. taste. nice ; )",5
this place gave me food poisoning. within an hour of eating here i was throwing up my insides. i had seafood noodles. never eating here again. please avoid. i was violently ill for days.,1
food was ok but the staff were horrible! worst service i've ever had. two young women were incredibly rude and put me and my friend off the rest of the meal.,1
"rip off!! i went here at 2am to have a small plate of black bean chicken, only to find they over charged me by about 10 they charged me 20 for this i realized the next day! stay away from these greedy people.",1
"nice small chinese eatery serving simple but very tasty food. huge portions and really good value, great beef noodle soup. quick efficient and friendly service and always busy. says a lot. highly recommended.",3
"delicious pork buns, youtiao and wan tan soup. cheap eats",5
"absolutely mega dim sun and let me tell you, i don't take my dim sun lightly. i remember the first time i had dim sun, it made me weep salty tears of joy as i gnawed away my woes with a porky ball of happiness. far east chinese dim sun made me cry with such happiness i got thrown out.",5
"gems in london china town, small place with few choice, but all are great, i try both congee and noodle, taste is really original.plus rare to find place serve  baozi in ukhighly recommend....",5
was here today around 11:00. poor food and really bad service,1
couldnt recommend this place when the service and food is waste of money and time,1
"we had a great time here! the food was nice, the price cheap and the service awesome. they even gave us a container! perfect for small groups.you can pay either with money or with a debit card",5
"huge portion. tastes above average. opens earlier than most chinatown restaurants in the weekend. friendly staff. pastries smell and tastes good. language spoken: english, mandarin, cantonese.",3
good value for money. good food. great location. very efficient service.,5
my bag is stolen yesterday in the restaurant and the worst thing is they have video camera in the restaurant and owner was not willing to check the camera and said its none of my business!the worst thing in the world!,1
"nice place, good food and decent service.",5
super tasty beef noodles. meat dumplings ok. well come back again,5
smell of pee and marijuana,2
so so food and so so service. too pricey for what it is. ,2
they wouldn't let me in! they said they didn't give tables to people by themselves! unbelievable! i asked how much i would have to spend if they would and was told 20. little did they know i always spend well in excess of that. v rude people.,2
"very nice food , waiter was rude ... but he was probably naive .... food wasvery good though .",5
it's more like a 3.5 star restaurant. not bad but not particularly good. ,3
not bad not great,2
terrible. the foods were awful. yuck!!!!!,1
chinese restaurant that meet the basics,3
avoid eating there. tasteless without any finesse served dishes.,1
amazing. perfect.,5
the service of the staff is ok at least they responded to requests. fairly cosy place and quite pleasant to sit in. like the soybean curd and juice and always nice to go with deep fried dough snakes. they served pineapple bun with margarine instead of butter which i felt being shortchanged.,4
"terrible service, cheap quality food and forced to pay service charge !",1
good food and hk desserts. cash only.,4
the only chinese restaurant open in morning,5
"i ordered wanton noodles soup and was not tasty at all, the dumplings were heated in the microwave and the staff is always grumpy. some times even rude.",1
so happy to find  at this place. however other dishes were not as good as expected.,4
lovely efficient friendly staff. the food was really tasty and plenty of it.,4
huge portions everything was good!,4
"very cute and small restaurant,very organised in good prices.excelent service.",5
this is home to the best youtiao (fried dough sticks) in chinatown.,5
"never again, food was ok (just ok) but the service was shite, very much felt like they just wanted us in and out as quick as possible. i resent having to pay service charge, ridiculous. feel like i got conned having to pay 6 for a plain chow mein. absolute piss take.",2
"for me , i can eat chinese tasting food is priceless ~ too far from here to hk",5
kind of expensive and small portion.  just ok quality of food.,3
limited menu options to choose from but good food. would go again.,4
"worst service. came in, empty tables, 3 of us, and they try to make us buy 4 dishes to eat there. when i say tried, i mean nothing subtle about it. walked out and will never go hear again. place like this, with zero love for their customers, will never have good food.",1
"i've never had a reason to complain. food is average, but i tend to go for coffee and chinese cakes. inside cosy and atmosphere unhurried and chilled. ",5
"the service is fair. staff can speak fluent mandarin, cantonese and english. we ordered fried rice and fried noodles. it just taste the same like in hong kong! worth for the price!",4
do not order their stir fried noodles - no flavor. their congee and baked stuff are edible.,2
"rude staff, had to ask for my bill 4 times, when i got up to pay at the counter they shoved it in my face. the food was just below average, the turnip cakes was inedible ",1
impressive,5
"nice food, 1 member of staff dampened the experience becuase of his bad mood and poor social skills. there was also no music, very long tables and you can hear all the details conversions of people next to you.",2
feng shui inn is the best ,5
standard selections but more if you're into insides (feet/tripe/tongue),4
just had a lovely sichuan meal... the best in chinatown imho... go for the stir fried red chilli chicken on bone and water boiled spice & numb (sichuan mala) fish.  out of this world .,5
very friendly though the covers are a bit squeezed. the dim sum had one or two  items i'd not tried before and the tab was reasonable.,3
"rude employees,  exceptionally bad customer service,  no wifi,  small portions, horrible dirty bathrooms. ",1
picked this at random on stroll through chinatown having not seen any reviews. the crispy duck was actually pretty good and it was the best thing out of what we tried.,3
had dim sum here n it was absolutely amazing#!! ,5
nice range of chinese food with spicy specials.,4
"standard chinese in china town, dim sum is a little too wet, char siu very average, the crispy duck possible a notch above average.",3
great food  even pleasing my fussy child.  amazing staff too,5
excellent dumplings and friendly staff,5
very bad food,1
"average food, pricey for what you get. it is annoying that the bill isnt itemised - just a number written on a piece of paper.",2
"great food, tasty; service is basic as anticipated.",5
great chinese food!!,5
"great chinese meal, customer service and even a dragon came in as was chinese new great when visited",4
no the greatest in china town...,2
"bad service, cold staff and mediocre food. i won't recommend this place for chinese food. ",1
the food: chow mein was not fresh and the noodles were dry and too oily. vegetable spring rolls were ok but still way too oily. bbq steam pork buns were ok but slightly dry. grilled prawn dumblings were not authentic and deceiving. overall i don't think that the food and the ambiance was too authentic.,2
food was terrible,1
we had a evening meal which is nice especially the tofu clay pot and the crispy chicken was compare well to manchester standard. ,4
"the sticky ribs, the sweet & sour pork, the crispy beef - all disgusting and shoddy - this place is below par and really should be avoided - the service has little to b desired also and there is no option to leave it out of the bill ",1
"super overpriced, small portions, not very good :( ",2
"comida pssima, atendimento pssimo.",1
expensive ,3
overpriced and disgusting,1
4stars food ,4
lovely food ,5
best duck,5
dear,4
great food!!!,5
nice little restaurant,4
great asian food,5
"i've been very disappointed by this restaurant. the quality of the food was just average and the main point of disappointment was the service. the staff members were not pleasant, portions were small and refills for the pancakes were ridiculously expensive. i would not recommend it.",2
awesome food,5
the rudest staff i have ever come across. service is appalling and they have the cheek to put another 12.5% service charge on top of that.  avoid,1
"broken chicken bones in the glutinous rice, and after pointing this out they neither replaced the dish nor refunded it. food took over an hour to arrive. staff seemed clueless.",2
terrible staff. horrible experience.,1
the food was mediocre as well as the service. ,3
"not real good chinese food, disappointed.",2
awful,1
awfully dirty toilets urine dripping into a bowl .. not nice,2
very busy restaurant in the heart of chinatown ,4
"food is ok, but the service is the slowest in the world and not nice.",1
very poor quality food and rude service,1
overpriced everything very poor curry from a packet. avoid! ,1
excellent food,5
very good food place heart of chinatown,5
horrible staff. run away as fast as you can ,1
it is ok,4
a small wait as was busy through the chinatown.  very pleasant service.  food was delightful. no rush to move you on. will visit again. ,4
in a rush but served amazing chinese a*,5
did not know that you have to pay 12 for the service... i was there by myselfe and ate for 17 ... and had to pay 29. not a nice surprise:(,1
"great value lunch options and quite filling. karaoke rooms are decent value too if you want to try, including the food. also very good spicy fish dishes.staff are nice, and it is comfortable seating and not too noisy.",4
dim sum is not as good as other places,3
"expensive, worst crab soup in my life",1
overpriced & unfriendly staff,1
small portions high prices very bland and almost tasteless food definitely one to avoid  considering the choice locally,1
"high prices for small portions, unfriendly and rude staff.",1

"beautiful food, excellent service and lovely atmospher.",5
great meal and well worth a visit.,5
"what a great restaurant located in the heart of london, chinatown. it is wonderful to know that this gem is still serving traditional authentic cantonese dishes mix with specialist szechuan dishes when many have lost their identities... you can tell this place is good when majority of their customers are filled with chinese patrons...",5

"overpriced restaurant with normal food and canned drinks, nothing special. 5 for coconut water that i could have bought for 1.20? cramped eating area in a messy state. would not reccomend.",2
"a really nice and friendly chinese restaurant in the heart of china town.large menu, good food and good service.",4
poor service food ok but grossly overpriced 12.5% service charge snuck onto the bill which is only written in mandarin characters which is unlawfulavoid as there are plenty of others to choose fromshould be investigated by trading standards,1
to be sure always ask for the speciality of the house : crispy  duck . also the pork dumplings are home made and very tasty although a tad too damp. the service is a bit faulty . we had to ask for the bill several times and they took my first dish 10 minutes after that of my mate ... ,3
great food and good environment,4
great food...excellent ambience and very clean.,5
this is definitely rubbish restaurant. they charged us 1 pound per cup of hot water. their serviceis cold. whats eve worse is their food is not tidy. i had a bad stomachache. not recommend at all. dont go there.,1
food ok. service average. quality to price ratio not the best,3
very good sichuan food in the heart of chinatown. busy and noisy just as a good chinese restaurant should be.,4
incredibly overpriced and bad food. 6.50 for a single dish of liu sha bao that was overcooked. avoid.,1
"too expensive, not delicious, dry noodles. poor service. don't come here again!!!!!!!!!",1

"nice food, i loved the crispy duck!",4
"good food. been there before. typical china town service. usually visit when in london. perhaps, time the interior is refurbished?",4
"nice service, good food!",4
bad food rude staff avoid,1
food was less than ordinary,2

"stumbled upon this place, looking for dim sum for lunch. absolutely wonderful! huge selection, melt in the mouth and simple, clean surroundings. visit, you really wont be disappointed and you can sit in the window area and watch the hustle and bustle of china town get in with daily life as you eat. ill be back!",5
a great little hole in the wall chinese place with slightly expensive food. overall though still quite good but not exceptional chinese food,4
fantastic chinese restaurant! delicious food. cosy and seemingly authentic interior. will visit again.,5
not bad. food is delicious. price is quite alright for london prices.,4
"average food, unpleasant service and ridiculous prices.",2
"friendly manager, and service was nice. food is good value and in the center of china town",5

food just ok and so expensive.,3
great food,5
"went with no reservation, seated immediately, service excellent great chat with staff,food excellent not expensive and would highly recommend",5
possibly the best chinese meal i've ever had. i thought gars in brighron was untouchable but the feng shui inn changed my mind. food (and drink) was incredible and the staff were superb. we will definitely be back,5
food is good but service is rubbish and food took forever to arrive,4
i have been in this place a lot of time and never been disappointed and i will go a lot more,5
great atmosphere in a perfect spot. also helped that the food was top class!,5
"in the heart of china town, we should have guessed it wasn't going to be great.",3
"chief waitress tried to rob us. 12.5% service charge added and then she said this wasnt enough and we should tip on top for her girls. poor service and very cheap mediocre food, ramming people in to make money from tourists. table stunk of bleach. would never return!",1
great chinese food with great material and very good cooking. great quality in dim sum and ali foods. i recommend to all my friends.,5
"it is one of the restaurants serving dim sum all day long so if you crave for a dim sum dinner, it is where you go. the service is definitely the highlight of feng shui inn. staff are much more welcoming compared to other restaurants in the neighborhood. but the food is average. a minimum expense of 10 is required for card payment.",3
ok but overpriced for what is on offer,3
very bad food and very rude staff! the worst chinese meal i have ever eaten.,1
delicoius  food.good service.,5
great service - delicious food.,5
"normally quite busy during lunch, especially weekends. food is good and they have a good dim sum selection that seems to be always available. dim sum prices are comparable with other places but other dishes can be quite pricey. i would recommend it if you want some dim sum.",5
i see a lot of bad reviews... i used to go here frequently and always received great service from a girl called emma i believe who was from malaysia originally. place always had the great cantonese staples i am used to from my childhood in los angeles.,5
lovely dim sum. a little pricey but is london and freshly cooked. good service,4
very lovely staff however manger lets it down. she was very rude!  2 drinks and 3 starters came to almost 30. which is a bit of a joke! one drink was a can of fizzy juice for 2.90!!!! - food was nice enough.,2
"great tasty lunch, happy friendly staff",5
"simple, tasty, really friendly - i'd definitely come back.",4
"good, fast, nice",5
really enjoyed the food and the service was excellent,4
"it never amazes me how inconsistent the quality of food is in chinatown. this was no exception, food was average to poor.  we had a mixture of dim sum and other menu items and the dim sum was disappointing.  the best chinese food tends to be away from chinatown.",3
"nothing special but expensive, the best was the soup the main dishes were not well tasting. i would not come again.",2
"came on a weekend at night, food was pretty good, prices were on the higher side. we had 3 dishes and each of the portions were quite generous. from their menu it looks like their speciality is hot pot, so im wanting to go when its cooler to give that a go. recommend if you want decent food, service isnt that great ...",4
"a proper chinese dim sum place in china town, london. the price isn't expensive, service is good. special fried rice a little bit dry, but delicious. will be back again.",4
good food but not the best,3
i would give 5 stars if the price was lower.,4
reviewing all the reviews and it's maybe bad for a lot of people. at the same time good too. i would truly recommend not to eat there.,1
very good food,5
doors were still open at almost midnight with a fast service and very nice food.,5
tried by chance on as visit to london. we had dim sum and everything we had was very enjoyable.,4
"it was refreshing to be able just to walk in and get a table at a restaurant in central london.  dim sum was ok, aromatic duck was particularly good. the rest of the food (fried rice, beef, chicken...) was disappointing. and more importantly, the bill was higher than expected.",3
"quite possibly the worst chinese food i've ever had, bland with a complete lack of authenticity. dishes fail to even in the slightest resemble what they should taste like. would be shocked if the chef has ever treated an authentic dish and if he has then he should be utterly ashamed. expensive rubbish.",1
"not great, not terrible. randomly picked from the intimidating number of restaurants in chinatown. the food was average, although quite greasy. it was super busy, and the service not great because of it. it wasn't terrible but i probably wouldn't go back on purpose, nor recommend it.",3
"great rice, decent spring rolls, average noodles, poor service.",3
"nice deco with a gold fish pond as you walk in. staff friendly, good sense of humour and strong knowledge on menu. reasonably priced, tasty food and large portions.",5
loved this place went a few years ago then i lost itwe went back to london and i found it,5
the worst chinese restaurant in london we paid 5.5 pounds for a bunch of dry noodles (no wonder its 5.5 pounds ) i do not recommend to eat at this restaurant ,1
really bad service! and massively overpriced! a pot of tea charged us 9. will never come back here again!,1
"small plates, very overpriced, tasted bad salty old. the service was a bit rude. wouldn't come back again ever.",1
5 service charge for a 14 bill and the taste is below average.,2
"food not bad. but as with most chinese restaurants in chinatown, they will rush you to pay once you are done with your meals",3
"the food is not even worth the 1 star. its tasteless. the food was partially cold and chicken was flavourless. there are wonderful restaurants in chinatown, and then there are places like this.",1
lovely customer service.  the chilli sauce is very spicy!  we got a take away.,4
"very bad! do not recommend, we were push out... sat for 25min and the price are overrated for the meals.",1
"dumplings were great. a portion was a little bit small, but they were amazing.crispy duck with pancakes was very good but missing option of sauce.main was very average, nothing special, which won't know the difference between wasaabi and this meal.service was slow.",3
"it is overpriced, for the same money i ate 3 course menu in a korean restaurant",3
friendly staff and good dim sum.,4
ok food but beware the 12.5% rip off non negotiable service charge added to your bill if you like it or not. rude management. rushed service. avoid!,1
lovely meal with friends,4
good food and good service,5
really nice food and quick service.,5
very nice hotpot with lots of food included. staff were very helpful and lovely!,5
"tiny portions, high prices, in fact twice the price of local alternative in dim sum. service was however friendly and the decor pleasant. hugely disappointed though as we came out hungry and out of pocket compared to competitors in china town. won't be back.",2
"actially, i am trying to be turned into vegetarian.  there are so many vegetarian option.",5
food was amazing! perfect level of epic and a nice atmosphere. service was a little slow and didn't look very happy,4
we've been to this place many times and we love it!!,5
"top quality food and excellent service, must come back as this is the genuine article.",5
"baaaaad service and food, expensive ",1
"love to visit here for chinese food, especially for dim sum.",5
nice chinese authentic food in chinatown,3
"did not meet expectations, food fine but not happy with the 12.5% service charge automatically added as we were felt pressurised to leave at 11.30, air conditioning on full which made everyone uncomfortable. on the bill our time of entrance was22.22 and exit was shown as asap.  be aware and check the competition.",3
the portion of food was very small compared with similar dishes at other restaurants. service and atmosphere was good.,3
always good food with good atmosphere.,4
"used to be my go-to chinatown place, revisited for first time in years. v nice, good food, everyone friendly. food came a bit too quick and prices very high compared to other nearby restaurants, especially the dim sum which seemed double normal prices??",4
"quiet, good food, price okay for london",5
"overly priced!! a spring roll starter (4 rolls, 5cm x 1.5cm each) costs 8.80. bad service as well.",1
"hands down best hair salon in central london. the staff are so friendly and welcoming! for a reasonable price you can get a massage/hairwash, before a fantastic cut finished with another hair wash and style. the shop is very beautiful and extremely clean!!!",5
"my favourite ;place to grab dim sum in central. good 'traditional' selection of dim sum, service is quick and friendly. often busy but always seem to get a table. reasonably priced.",4
great and tasty food if a little rushed,4
"best dim sum in chinatown, staff are a bit miserable",4
good crabs,4
unfresh ingredients and over charged me,2
good dimsum and great central location. reasonably priced.,4
"the food was great, i think the staff can use some customer service training. the variety off dishes was worth it.it is a very little place so keep this in mind if you are planning on bringing little children with strollers.",4
good food freshly cooked. fast service. located in chinatown.,5
"customer service varies, communication is difficult sometimes...i recommend the dim sum but it ends a certain time so beware. food is great, sometimes they bring the wrong area, make sure you check before eating ! they put bill as a total rather than itemized. service charge always added.",3
excellent food and excellent service very friendly staff,5
very delicious food! the best hot and sour soup! the service is very good. everybody is friendly and smiling! the ambience is simple but nice. recommend!!!,5
"our friends were in town and in the market for good chinese food so we took advice from a friend who lives largely in china and he pointed us here. spotted a chef from a recent saturday kitchen queuing ahead of us and no wonder, the food was great and the staff really helpful. we will return.",5
food is always freshly made and tasty.  average prices.  came in for dimsum which are served until around 4pm.,5
"delicious food, fast service and great location, would recommend.",5
"my favourite place to go for dim sum and szechuan crab, the service is great and the staff are nice, would definitely recommend.",5
"amazing food - i loved the soup, the prawns and the mushroom dishes. service was a bit rude, but highly recommend the food!",5
"perfect place, very good taste",5
"staff were very rude. asked us to pay the bill upfront and treated us as if they were waiting for the next customer. very disappointed in this place, felt as if we were not welcome",1
"we were visiting london (from canada) and thought to try dim sum. food was great, prices were reasonable, and service was as expected. would definitely recommend.",5
"tasty food, but pretty limited selection for yum cha.",4
we always eat at gerrards corner when we are in chinatown. food is great but service can be patchy. avoid 12.30 - 2 pm when they are desperately busy. they serve dim sum until 5 pm.,4
"always busy but extremely delicious dimsum with reasonable price!! totally worth the queue so i dont mind coming back every now and then, staffs are busy but always try their best to accommodate guests. definitely recommended, especially the prawn dimsum",5
steamed dumplings and deep fried dumplings were the best in soho. staff were friendly and welcoming. service was quick and efficient. the only drawback were the custard steamed buns got a bit messy as filling is a little too runny. apart from that they are the best restaurant in chinatown by some distance.,5
"rip off !! avoid. i am asian. they thought we were tourist so begging us for tips although service charge was already included. they told me 'that the way we do it here' lol. if this is the way this restaurant is managed, management should be ashamed of themselves.",1
quick stopover for delicious dimsums & noodles! love the seafood ho fun,5
"excellent food, quick service. the only thing i would say was you feel rushed as they try and get you out to reuse your table.",4
very picturesque,4
my family loves dum sum.  this place is me news favourite. loved this place.,5
our favourite dim sum place!,5
dim sum very good and service good once seated although had to wait about 45 minutes for a table when told it would be 10-15 minutes. this was a sunday at approx 1pm though,4
"food acceptable. totally unacceptable service. cloth was removed at the same time as the plates were taken. no questions regarding dessert or coffee. bill and payment directly. then they wanted gratitude! got nothing, then they got even more rude. avoid! plenty of others in the area.",2
best cantonese restaurant in london,5
"food not that great, appears cheap outside on the menu and then they smack the 12% gratuity on for just slamming plates on your table. hand written receipts with no break down of prices or drinks showing. i wont be going again.. they also come across rude when challenged about the price hike.oh and the prawn crackers are stale.",1
delicious and authentic. do not expect european-style service. the staff are directly to the point in their aim to quickly serve you and remove dishes your are done with.,5
"great food, great service, great place ",5
its a restaurant situated in the heart of chinatown and were came here for dinner.. so many people recommended it to us but in my opinion the taste is a little weird probably because im used to chinese food in italy,3
amazing dim sum.,5
lovely food and staff.  good value,5
high quality authentic chinese dimsum corner. service is fast despite the restaurant being packed to the brim.,5
gorgeous food and lovely staff. friendly atmosphere and reasonable prices too,5
adequate buffet,3
love this place.  the staff are very attentive and the food is just something else.  defo worth a visit if in china town,5
 amazing chinese restaurant! the peking duck was awesome and the garlic shrimp was so great.  i highly recommend it!,5
have been coming here for years . food v.good. service v.good. service charge= 12.5%. waitress told us tips were separate from service charge. this was wrong and therefore won't return as my local chinese does not do this.,3
what an absolutely delicious mealbest i've ever had and my boyfriend works at a chinese! completely recommend for a china town experience ,5
"food was good but didn't give an itemised bill, when i asked for one they had charged us twice on a couple of dishes, seem to be a it of a con!",2
good dimsum joint and well priced. will visit it again.,4
bad food. told server i did not like a dish. nothing was done to accommodate.,1
very busy chinese restaurant.,5
"rushing us to finish up and limit us to  one order and still charge us for non-compulsory service charge, our bill was 24, they charge 3 for tips. the one star is for the food",1
best beef curry ive ever had!only negative is the space which is very neglected.,5
lovely restaurant,5
"poor service, food average and pricey..",1
adequate service but no character and disappointing flavourless food.  would not recommend or go again.,2
amazing food at a good price in a well decorated restaurant with professional staff and a good atmosphere. would highly recommend!,5
lovely service and friendly staff. food was quick and very tasty.,5
"we didn't find this food any good. chicken in rice dish was rubbery. everything tasted pre-made and bland. so many options in area, silly to waste your time here.",1
"fast, delicious and looks very nice!",5
food not great. avoid the set menus. read the small print regarding service charge. duck was good.,3
lovely place. whenever i come to london i always pop in here for really delicious king prawn dumplings,5
great food. been here many times and have always relished the food. very friendly staff & good customer service.,5
always excellent service and food.,5
great service food good visit every time i go to london would recommend,5
i do enjoy this yumcha place. it is definitely one of the few decent ones and affordable!! it does get quite busy.,4
"it was very good, fast service, well cooked, very generous portions, with a menu for 3 we ate well 5 of us with good appetite. worked out better than a buffet in terms of price.",5
"food very nice, staff miserable and unfriendly. 12.5% service charge added so staff don't be happy and helpful for that reason i guess",4
been here twice now and had a very good meal and service on both occasions,5
the vegetarian dim sum was delicious! well seasoned and didnt need an ounce of soy sauce. service was quick and waiters friendly enough,5
"rude staff, dirty we walked out",1
"great place to eat, fast device and tastes great. would definitely come again",5
worse customer services i have ever come across!!!  the girl who handed our bills should be sack!!  damn rude and grumpy.  am surprised the business still going having employed people like her.  and whats this 12.5% is a must??? i thought its up to the customers and not the management?,1
food was ok but less tasty than at a prior visit. service was rushed and not attentive. we were disappointed. they used to be much better.,2
"huge quantities, absolutely delicious. very friendly staff taking good care of you which is rare in big restaurants like this. very short waiting time, was a really good experience !",5
"great food. good price too. i only give 4 stars because the service was more like fast food than restaurant, they didn't even ask us if we want desert or coffees, they were still cleaning the table wile they brought the bill.",4
"very bad food and old material, expensive  ,unfriendly,rude,personels,",1
"best chinese food i've had, huge portions, only bad part was staff were all rather miserable never once cracked a smile",4
"awful service from the staff, were very rude!! would not reccomend to anyone and will 100% not be attending again",1
"poor service, rude staff",3
when u think there is nowhere to have something to eat at midnight or even later. this place is always open and food is really good.,4
"very good food, especially tim sum",5
"i come all the way from australia for this chinese.  (well sort of).  on trips to london i always make this the first stop in my itinary.nice food, with the main menu like a good old british chinese takeaway and an ""authentic"" chinese menu.rather busy at times.",5
"a very nice chinese restaurant in london's chinatown, with a large and interesting menu. great price too.",5
"really great dim sum, roast duck and noodles.",5
excellent chinese food at great happening place,4
"disappointing food. the vegetarian dishes were barely ok, but my boyfriend's meat dishes were really terrible, chewy and flavourless",1
"good food, good service, always busy though so get ready for a wait!",5
"terrible, terrible food, rude staff, and tried to sneak a 20% service charge onto the bill by providing only a final number (with no breakdown) and then on top asked for another service charge! do not go here. there are so many much better places right next to it.",1
"food tasted horribly of chemicals, i was sick after i had a few bites of an unidentified meat in dim sum, and the service was extremely poor. no itemised bill either. never going back there and actively discourage people from going as well. this place ruined my day.",1
waitress tried to subtly add additional service charge on top of the 12.5% discretionary charge already on our bill when we asked to split the bill  among ourselves. dim sum was ok but wouldnt recommend due to dishonesty.,1
"so good i've actually been here twice in an evening. relaxed chinese dining with speedy service, friendly serving staff and tasty food! get a crispy duck for the table to kick things off. ",4
"fast, medium priced food, the sauces are too sweet for my taste.",3
disgustingly dishonest restaurant. tries to charge extra during payment because of supposed service charge and vat (on top of included vat and s/c). carefully check your bill. or take your money somewhere else. avoid!,1
it is relatively cheap in london. good food reasonable price.,5
"very busy restaurant and good food. if the bill can show the price of what we ordered, that would be great . we were in a rush so didn't ask for a detailed bill",3
lovely food and busy staff .we have been before and service is as good as last time we went.,5
they overcharged you on the bill. avoid going there. they don't show you the list of items. and they rush you out as well and paying 12.5% tips,1
good value for money. dim sum o.k. perfect for a quick lunch.,3
best dimsum i've ever had,5
staff very friendly but food wasn't as good as it used to be won't be rushing back.,2
"great food, great value for money. i must for amy one who likes chinese food",5
"felt as if they wanted you in and out, dated and cheap feeling!",3
amazing food!! must try,5
"the food is great, one of the best chinese restaurants in china town and it's always full.  they charge 12.5% service charge but still the waiters ask for their tip. i thought that was illegal!",4
really enjoyed the food here. i had the shredded chicken noodles and they tasted really great! also had home made icetea which also tasted really good!the vegetarian food looks good aswell my friend says it tastes really good aswell,5
"the dim sum was lovely! and if you go with a group of friends, you will be able to try so many types of them at a reasonably cheap rate. i had a chance to try over 8 types and it cost me just almost 12",4
do not order chicken fried rice. practically no chicken on it. or anything else for that matter. no flavor and poor service.,1
service charge which they inform you about after you have order yours drinks . they should inform this before you get your table . i don't have a issue paying service charge if you get good service . but don't like to be informed if you don't pay service charge we ask you to leave as this is part of our wages .,2
terrible rude staff and food,1
wonderful day out. full of life/activity!crowded..lots of places to eat/ shop,5
"great restaurant, but gets very busy, had a 25 min wait to get seated. food was nice.",4
"i consider this to be one of the best chinese restaurants in london. quick service, good food, and a feeling of being welcome. ",5
i was asked to leave the restaurant because i was not gonna spend a minimum amount that they required with the excuse that it was sunday and they get a lot of customers on weekends even though there were a lot of empty tables.,1
"lovely spot for chinese food, loved it.",5
really nice - staff a little pushy but normal for china town,4
plain decor. rude staff. okayish food.,1
"awful toilets, no itemised bill and scammed my pensioner mum by saying she gave them a dodgy 20 note so she gave them another.  when confronted they were rude and aggressive. definitely swapped her good 20 for a fake . avoid at all costs.",1
check your receipt...,1
my order was delayed mored than 30mins. paying to  the counter for me is not right no itemised to the bill only total it end up i was overcharged of 1 order of the dimsum which is i felt bad.,2
super quick service. right in china town. great food. good prices. staff are very efficient and friendly.,5
"tables a little squashed on a saturday night and you are probably going to have to queue but well worth the wait. great food, good vegetarian selection and friendly attentive service.",4
really good service...not like other restaurants i've been in. i also asked the waitor if their food contains msg or flavour enhancers. he went inside and the manager came out to assure me that they do not use msg in their food. amazing ,5
"bad service, waiters who blame customers for their mistakes, we did not receive the food we order, they took from our table three double taxes, and double tip. i will not come back again",1
ok the food is fine. but i said i wanted crispy fried noodles with chicken and vegetables and when they gave me chow mein with bean sprouts.. i wasn't happy. but they refused to change it. not cool.,1
"very quick service, food was delicious",4
"oh my god.  the food is substandard.  either very salty or very greasy.  the staff is greedy and pushing for an extra tip even though the service charge is included.  gerards corner, will you see me again?  i dont think so.",1
food was ok but they tried to steal my friends phone. after leaving the phone at the restaurant they claimed it was not there and only returned it the next day after being shown gps tacking that it was still there. very unprofessional bordering on theivery,1
"food was good but then they included, without saying, over 25% in tips. receipt said nothing. staff were also in a rush - not very friendly.",1
good food. little bit more expensive than some of the nearby restaurants. beer and some spirits available. usual grumpy staff expected in china town lol.,4
good food but a 12.5% service charge with no itemised bill provided,2
one of my fav restaurants in chinatown. never tired of going there for dinner,5
high quality to price ratio,4
this place is really good and the food is delicious. don't believe any reviews that tell you otherwise.if you don't want the waiters constantly bothering you when you're eating then this place is great.this restaurant is definitely the best meal in china town and i would recommend it to anyone who loves chinese food.,5
"food was amazing - had prawn toast, beef with black sauce and chili, fried rice and aubergine/tofu with prawn in it.service was poor, but expected - made reservation at 7, wasn't given a table until 7:20, inattentive staff but the place is busy hence understandable.",4
"not my first time here and this did not disappoint. crispy aromatic duck was great, other dishes also above average plus very nice jasmine tea. i'll avoid the house pink wine next time.",4
"superb meal, thank you",4
"food is good however there is a 12.5% service charge and then the waitress tried to get us to give her a tip on top of that. apparently the manager takes the 12.5% service charge! also they hide it by not giving you an itemised receipt, they give you a piece of paper with your total.",3
best chinese in london. just becareful. they add the tip in to the bill at the and do not tell you. then you add more not knowing. but good chinese,4
"surprisingly good restaurant in the heart of china town. we've had a pecking duck, dim sum, and some sides and everything was very good.",4
we were told we could only order once so they could keep turning over the table. the food was ok but not spectacular.,3
"i had a better meal here ages ago. it's a pretty basic chinese restaurant. the taste for the dishes were fine, but the portions have really diminished in size.within 5 mins of paying our bill, we were asked if we could vacate the table so they could bring in more customers- never a good way to impress anyone.",2
"not good, food is below average, better choices in area",2
"been here a few times now. it's our 'go to' place for chinese food when down in london and in the west end. food and service is acceptable. still think our local chinese takeaway in glasgow,  the cathay cuisine is my favourite!",4
awesome food. great service. if my hotel had a microwave i would have taken the rest of my food with me. i was so full but didn't want to let it go.,5
dimsum is really tasty here and the prices are reasonable compared to other places in china town. there's quite a lot of seating which are not tightly packed together.,5
they dont give you an itemised bill so you dont realise they already added 12.5% service. then when you go to pay they suggest you should gove a tip.very sneaky,1
service was pleasent and quick. lots of asian diners. loved the chicken feet in black been sauce. special steamed dumplings were enjoyed as well.,4
like the dim sum here. the  here really will .,4
great place. reasonable prices,5
"be aware - price scamthey will charge you additional 12,5% for eating in without telling you (on top of the 10% service charge). it is not mentioned in the menu which is deceiving. the food is ok, however i would strongly suggest to give up this intransparent pricing methods in the future. until then they wont see us again.",1
excellent food as  before will come again,5
"disgusting. overcooked and over fried dishes it seems like eating cork. perfect if you want to eat bone and don't really have taste. we waited 65 min!! for the dishes and there was not a simple apology. of course, a 10% extra because their good job ;)",1
"best chinese restaurant i've found in london! good staff, large menu, and the food is delicious! highly recommend",5
super busy! dishes are small portion and taste ok,2
"good food, not the best service. had an experience where a staff member tried to force a service charge on the customer, considering it is not legally required.",1
only been here for standard dim sum but it's pretty good.  it's not the best i've ever had - not even close to be honest.  but it's consistent and i always enjoy it.,4
the worst service of my life,1
absolutely terrible. horrible service. small portions. and they tried to charge us before we ate our food because i simply asked about the service charge of 12.5%,1
"speedy & friendly staff. tasty food, but a little bit too much sauce. overall nothing to complain. went there twice during nye, though there were a lot of people we didnt had to wait too long.",5
favourite dim sum in chinatown. excellent and fast service.,5
"a very bad  experience, the service is awful and cold.expensive chinese food for zero quality.not recommanded.",1
"love it, delicious dim sum. reasonable price.",5
"little pricy but the best chinese i've been to. 4 stars because the staff are efficient but not really engaging with customers enough, had to ask twice for another diet coke.",4
over price and cold food. poor service in the bottom with toilets.,1
"delicious dim sum and crispy duck. friendly staff and fast service. reasonable prices. been here twice, now and 1,5 years ago. same quality and just as tasty both times.",5
"amazing food and service, never had a bad time here.",5
delicious freshly made food,5
really like this place for a night out on the beers. get a set dinner and they fill you up with loads of food. for london it's well priced and they find you a table pretty quick every time i've been there even though its always busy.,4
"expensive, probably because it is in a tourist area. food wasn't great and service was quite unfriendly and poor",2
i love this restaurant. i've been coming for years. the food is really great,5

chinese restaurant for dim sum.,3
the food was great and it was fast. service was good.,5
"everything was slimy , average cheap food, lobster was gelly , service very basic . not raccomended ! very touristic place",2
terrible service and duck was overcooked and dry,1

great restaurant with delicious dim sum. slightly cheaper than other restaurants in china town. service can be quite authentic too though had a good chat with the waiter,4
"average chinese restaurant, service was ok as we found a seat straight away.",3
very good service. friendly staff and very very good food. the atmosphere is also very friendly and prices for food are low.,5
"great customer service, amazing food and cocktails",5
"wow, 23 for a vegetable dish, in fact whole menu inflated 3-4x - such a rip off in the name of christmas.....",1
"food is good, but the queuing system is a total mess when its busy. i feel bad for the staff running it because it's so stressful, but also, its only so stressful for everyone because the organisation is terrible.",3
they never give an itemised bill. adds extra items on the bill. happened three times this year. each time they removed the extra items and said mistake was due to them being busy. imagine the number of people shy to question the bill. not going any more. watch out if you are three or more persons.,1
"great chinese restaurant, huge menu, great service",5
"late night meal after evenings hard work. splendid chinese food, immaculate service, good wines, reasonable prices. lively even after 11pm.",5
"awesome authentic chinese, it's a must if you are around the area!",5
love the dimsum.friendly waiters!,4
had an enjoyable late night dim sum here. although it was a bit expensive due to the high service charge although staff were knowledgeable about allergy information. the coconut bubble tea was great.,4
"horrible service, they charge you for food that has not been served.disrespect and insults, they don't give you the claims sheet.i will never return",1
"food was really good. sizzling beef was really tasty. everything we ate was nice. dumplings, ribs, fried rice noodles, chicken. service was excellent. will be back again to try more dishes.",5
"we were with friends from france who couldn't speak english well, then they tried to rip off from us. fortunately i and another friend knew the price usually, but if we were tourist we wouldn't have noticed. after this experience i am careful in any restaurant in china town, and needless to say i never go back here.",1
"gone downhill a bit. too many tables squashed together, service bit slow, but it's a busy restaurant.",4
"food was lovely but unfortunately staff were quite rude, not people persons! afraid we wont be going back....",2
"a favourite!  nice and busy, friendly staff, good food.  service was really quick on a busy saturday evening!",5
i liked this one.it is much more spacious than many other restaurants around chinatown.has enough personnel.serves your food fast.offers good choice of wines.i will visit again,4
"food was great ,but they couldnt wait to get rid of us shocking service ,wasnt even busy and very expensive",3
"standard chinese in london china town, service is quick and after you eat you give table back lol",3
"convenient situation, efficient staff and delicious food, particularly the special fried rice. thoroughly recommended",5
"so disappointed, to expensive for nothing, waiter very unpleasant.don't go here! there are many better ones around !",1
this is my favourite chinese restaurant....the food is authentic and very good...,5
a great place for a bite to eat or a feast.  my friend and i got dim sum and noodles here.  bathrooms were small but clean. the waitress was very fellowship with suggestions.,4
really homemade traditional authentic chinese food.. good tastes.. not great environment as a decoration and staff is rude.. but i guess it is the way chinese culture is that makes me thing they are rude.. they might not be but i just felt they were. i would recommend and visit again for food and only,3
good lunchtime dimsum stop. was packed and then ppl shared tables. dishes lacked appropriate sauces and had to ask for them. food was good and ordered more to top up. steamed king prawn dumpling was yum... toilets clean and dinky sized w very narrow walkways,4
both the service and the food was great. would highly recommend this place for authentic dim sum.,5
always hard to find a decent restaurant in chinatown as you need to be careful of the food ratings as some are 1 out of 5 and some seem not to gave a rating.this restaurant is a 4 and was the busiest and so we chose it for lunch. we had the set b menu inc service charge for 43 and there was more than enough for two hungry blokes..,3
"a lovely, busy chinese right on the corner of the street. always busy, food always amazing and friendly, attentive staff.",4
"excellent, well priced dim sum!",5
was recommended to us and it was amazing food. good value for such great quality food. i always walk up and down chinatown looking for a decent place to eat. not anymore.,5
the restaurant provides no detailed receipt. a question on the details was addressed unprofessionally. food was not impressive.,1
"it's okay food, but very expensive for relative quality and have exceptionally questionable receipt processes and struggle to process multiple card transactions at once.",2
"unfriendly waitress, bad service. im sure there are plenty of better restaurants in china town",2

great authentic chinatown restaurant,4
"excellent food, fast and polite service",5
"does not deserve more than two stars, food is just about average, service is bearable, price alright for chinatown in central london.",2
"place is run down and dirty, toilets is a mess, food is poorly made(very greasy, very salty), meat dishes with barely any meat, twice expensive to normal asian takeaway.finally got overcharged. receipt didn't contain breakdown of total.go at your own risk",1
"amazing food, friendly and efficient service and nice environment, on a trip to chinatown i often end up here, always a winnee",5
food is great. however prices almost doubled compared to 2 years ago with portions being smaller. feel that management is getting greedy. ready to hunt for a new dimsum togo place,3
awesome.,5
"nice food, generous portions and decent prices.",4
food is good but the staff are incredibly rude,3
great !,4
"food was good however service is not great. try to force you to pay the ''discretionary"" service charge which was not worth the service we received.",3

my favourite restaurant,5
good authentic chinese food and extremely busy restaurant,4
very good food very quick service,4
delicious chinese food,4
food was not the greatest. sorry to say,3
"best dim sum for a saturday brunch. efficient service, authentic and delicious.",5
theres always a massive queue. but the food is totally worth it. if you like dim sum and chinese. come here. although checkbacks are not very often so you have to often wave to get attention.,4
very disappointed with the customer service. food good but there are other restaurants provide good food and excellent customer service e.g golden phoenix chinatown,1
love this place. service can be abrasive but who cares? food is fantastic and well priced.,5

"delicious food, fast and friedly service (maybe even a bit too fast). the portions are very big! (beware when ordering starters) we took the shrimp szechuan and the pork honey bbq, they were both very good. the only disappointing thing is the sweet and sour sauce - it tastes strange.",5
amazing chinese food with really fast service. pekking duck is incredible.,4
old traditional hk style dim sum place,3
great food.. but wish for better toilets,4
"reasonable price given that the food portion is big. the peking duck is a must, crispy skin and juicy tender meat.",4

there's a certain charm to this place.... and the crispy duck is the best,4
"it's okay but when we told the waiter one of our dishes were cold inside, he just felt the plate and said its fine, we told him to take it away and make a fresh one but he took our old one and put it in the microwave, something you don't want to see in a restaurant",3

terrible service..very cramp,2
great dumplings and dim sim menu,4
lovely dinner out with friends. food was good and i especially liked the beef with cashew nuts. good portion sizes too. recommend as a venue to entertain guests. has an authentic 'feel'. just note that they will only seat you after everyone has arrived ( or the majority) even with a prebooked reservation. busy restaurant.,4
the food is not good and neither is the service,1
"great chinese food. had mainly dim sum which was excellent.  fried rice and main dish of monks veg was very good too.

"great food, better than average. lovely staff and great service",5

decent chinese restaurant in the heart of china town london. they have a good variety of food in the menu and most of all yummy food. well priced too.,4

"simply disappointing & dishes being served were not reflective of any merits of true chinese cooking! i couldnt believe within 5 minutes after making our orders, 5 different cooking styles of dishes were ready which was truly impossible & something was definitely wrong! no need to mention the tastiness of those dishes!",1
good food great service!,5
good food at a decent place. quantities are quite large and the staff was accommodating to allergies.,4
"this is a medium sized restaurant in the heart of london's china town. the welcome and service was great, and the food very nice.",5
end to an annual event with friends. this place didn't disappoint.maybe a tad salty but good portions and tasty food.,4
place was okay. food was quick and most of it was good. lemon chicken was terrible. our waitress was extremely rude. she then left and someone else served us our food. plates were cleared away and waited for 20 mins afterwards to get the check. furnishings definitely need an upgrade,3
"great service, food did not meet expectations.",3
"the dim sums were fresh and tasty! although service was slightly abrupt, despite that i would definitely come back again.",4
food is excellent and the service is quick. quite authentic cantonese cuisine at a fair price!,5

food very good. service little bit disorganised but maybe because is christmas day anyway good experience. i do again,4
"horrible greasy food. horrible toilets. but the most horrible thing there is customer service. there were 2 out of 6 (or so) waiters who were okeyish, others were rude and unhelpful. shame that in this place tips are already being taken into your bill, if it would be complimentary i would not leave them a penny. avoid.",2
great lunch with friends. happy chinese new year. amazing food .,5
great food. quick service reasonable prices,4
came here after a long time. absolutely fantastic food and quick service.,5
"food was great, authentic chinese style. the service however was shocking, plates were dropped onto the table in an aggressive fashion while the chopsticks were basically thrown at you. if they polish up the service this would be a top joint.",3
"always come here when in london to buy buns for the next days breakfast. will always get a  (sausage bun), and they never fail to disappoint.the cakes are also very soft and fluffy, without being too sweet.",5

i didn't like the cakes all in one style,3
"no fuss no gimmicky cantonese bread shop. i have tried many other bakery  in chinatown, so far this is the best. it is a small shop so sometimes it can get really packed, and they only accept cash. highly recommended their roast pork bun, coconut butter crispy top bun, custard bun, and their pandan swiss roll.",4
"the best pastry i have ever tried, awesome cakes and delicious.best oriental cake shop in london.",5
"finally some bread quality that is at least as good as the average ones in north american asian bakery in london. though, the use of overly saturated food colouring and sense of art on cake decoration seems something of the late 90s. i would not get the cake but will def come back for the buns.",3
"i've been going here since i've been able to walk as a child, there was always an old man there who gave me free egg tarts! i still go here on occasion and its just the best cakes and buns in china town ! their custard buns are to die for and their fresh fruit cakes look amazing!",5

loved it china town great pastries,5
"this place serves up reasonably-priced chinese and asian pastry, breads, buns and cakes. quite a wide variety as well. prices range from 1.20 - 1.80 and portion of a bun is large for a person. worth a visit and is perhaps a lesser-patronised bakery unlike other bakeries in chinatown i.e. chinatown bakery.",4

"prompt service, excellent food and good value. had set menu b for 2 people @ 28 per head. generous portions. pity they dont serve draught lager, bottle of tiger beer 4.30 a little pricey but thats london prices for you. would definitely go back.",4
"could not believe how miserable the server was, she had no interest in being there as was clear from how she threw down on the table the oyster sauce. wrong drink came out first, then the food arrived which was ok but expensive. would not recommend, expensive and bad service",1
"lovely food,. but very expensive $$$$ wouldn't be so much of an issue but staff are literally on your back to leave when done, trying to take plates before finished eating, pressuring to by drinks, english isn't great and slapped wya service charge. thanks guys!",3
"to be honest 1 star is extremely generous!! they deserve 0 stars - do not eat here!! poor customer service, dirty dishes / glasses, hard rice (if they can't even cook rice right, then you can only imagine what the rest of the food is like), stale spare ribs, everything tasted bland / unseasoned.",1
"it's not drastically dissimilar to the other places nearby, but it is good.  it's clean, fast, friendly and the food is very tasty.we had an enormous dim sum lunch for around 15 pp which, for the quality, i think was pretty good value.",5

good food moderately priced,4
nice place. duck  is nicely cooked.,4
"food was really good, we felt like kings afterwards. idea of the rotating table is brilliant, so easy to share the meals and drinks. staff was just ok, they got upset when we wanted to change table after realising there would be more people despite the fact they didn't have any more groups coming in.",4
great food amazing service,5

"not really impressed. food came fairly quick but the staff weren't friendly and the place didn't do chips! imagine a chinese not doing chips? anyway had a chicken curry it was average, best thing about eating there was the nice fish tank they had. oh and spent a fortune and no free prawn crackers?! wouldn't go back.",2

"the portions are huge, which makes sense given the price. the waiter could have done a better job explaining the food questions we had asked . i was glad  to have waited before placing my order. food itself was fine,  nothing mind blowing.",4
"i come here exclusively for the dim sum, a bit more dear than other restaurants but the restaurant interior is beautiful, great ambience and photo opportunities. typical china town service, ride and quick to hi k you out as soon as you pay the bill. food does arrive quickly! women's toilets were clean and spacious.",4
"rude staff and compulsory surcharge added because ""the staff show you the menu and bring you the food"". average food. wouldn't come back .",2

the food is ok but too little to feed my stomach,4
"five star! delicious food, friendly staff, fast service. staff went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. food was 5*",5
the food was good but the staff were not. they were closing at 10 and we were seated at 9.30 but we were not informed of the closing time until after we had our bottle of wine . then they rushed all of our order to the table at once and we had to ask to have our main meals reheated . . much to the staff's dismay . would never go again,1
lovely food and great service!,4
this is a beautiful place to have a chinese and the staff are very friendly,5

"the food is exactly the same as the local chinesse restaurant, but the price is very expensive and the waiters are so not polite.",1
very good dim sum. little prices than average. ca 25 gbp / person. also service charge added. this is becoming a recent standard in  chinatown.,4
staff was pretty terrible. food was eh ok.one of the staff started yelling at me because i couldnt understand his terrible english.,1
"nice food,a little on the expensive side but guess it is chinatown after all",4
very poor service. and the pork belly was inedible. i would not return. and would advise to all not to visit.,1
walked in. a table was pointed to upstairs which we sat at.... for over 10 minutes without being offered a drink or anything. staff looked miserable and one waitress just staring into space. walked out eventually and went elsewhere. avoid!!,1
food is great but i'm not sure if it compensates for the bad service.,2

love the food! good dimsum. free parking. pretty busy on sundays for dimsum.,5
best chinese cuisine in london,5

good dim sum,5
just had v nice dimsum with family at this place. service was efficient and food hot. would recommend lobster noodles and seaweed wrapped king prawns. for the adventurous try the stewed ducks tongue! reasonable prices for chinatown.,4

"once and never again. the food is very expensive with low quality. hidden prices like rice for a menu, which was not included and also the 10% fee added up to the charge.plus the service was very unfriendly.not recommended!",1
rudest staff ever. took our order whilst staring at us the whole time with the nastiest look on her face taking out her note pad with such effort only to be told that my friend and i's order wasn't enough? she then said 'bye then see you next time'. such a beautiful restaurant with such tragic personalities.,1

pretty good but also pretty pricey.,3
third xmas meal brill every time.,4
"i had dim sim here recently and the food was nice. the dishes range from 3.5-6.00 and there's a lot of dim sum to choose from. the service was a bit rushed but the atmosphere of the place was pleasant. i would eat here again, however there are a lot of places to choose from in chinatown which are just as good.",3
decent dim sum so cannot complain. just don't expect a brilliant customer service - typical chinese service as you'd expect!,5
"an authentic hong kong yum cha palace in soho.  all the food was excellent, the service was fast and friendly.  if they had packed the doggy-bag for us they would have got the 5th star.",4
overpriced and not worth the money. service and food was not very good overall.,2
scrumptious food,5
i popped in here on chinese new year. to be fair this place is geared to turning over alot of people. we didn't book but managed to get a balcony table after a couple of minutes. the food was nice but i have had better take aways. however it's a great location in chinatown ,3
large well decorated restaurant right in the centre of chinatown. tables are well laid out meaning not cramped on your table. food is reasonably priced and over all very good.,4
"noodles weren't crispy, food overly salty. service was chinatown standard.",2
dim sum can be nice but dinner is a bit too salty and pricey....dinner is dim!,3
"lovely food,  service could have  been better!",4
good food but pricey.,3
do not go. the food is awful and the staff is basically angry that you walked in. this was a big mistake. do not make it as well.,1
"fast reliable , quite good shanghai soup dumplings.",4
good food but expensive,4
i would recommend this over most other restaurants in china town,5
good food and atmosphere.,4
very nice and friendly staff. food was nice. didn't have to wait long for food. overall a nice experience for our first time in china town,4
"is this authentic cantonese or not? i couldn't tell, but the number of locals eating in was encouraging. very efficient personnel and very nice food. not expensive at all.",5
"best duck ive had, and cheap",5
"wow fantastic place to eat food is  yummy  prices very good staff friendly, clean",5
amazing food,5
expensive . fast service . but much like a canteen ! food not bad,3
"good food, not as cramped as the other restaurants in china town",4
dim sum s ok.,3
"unfortunately, i really cannot recommend this place. what we had was not good, for example,  my dish hat a boiling hot broccoli and cold peas in it. most disappointing was the service, all of them appeared annoyed we asked something, even suggestions on how to combine sides with some main dishes. we felt totally underappreciated",1
good food but like so many places in chinatown these days not cheap due to the increasingly high punitive rents charged by commercial landlords in the area and the punitive business rates.,5
preferred restaurant for the chinese community. excellent service and great tasting food. lovely,5
had a very good meal here busy but not annoyingly so reasonable pricing for london,5
good foods and services ....,5
its was excellent quality. the best chinese food i tried in uk,5
let's start with entrance it is not easy if you have a pushchair or a wheelchair to get into the restaurant. staff looks a bit serious maybe becuase they are so busy . menu doesn't have any picture so for who doesn't know about the chinese food is very hard to choose. food quality is above-average.,3
worst experience. we have ordered sweet and sour chicken and we got half chicken half beef. the soup i ordered and the noodle chicken was tasteless. i would have paid only 3 pounds for it but unfortunately real price was 32 pounds for 2 main dishes and 1 soup.,1
"this place does/did sell shark fin soup, it can kill you because of the heavy metals",1
great service. excellent food,4
amazing!! great dim sum. lots of choices.,5
nice enough place for the price. wouldn't recommend the lemon chicken and in general the dishes were quite sweet.,4
very busy but good food,4
the food was average but the bill came to 120 for a few prawns and spring rolls. i actually couldn't believe it !!,1
"large and in the heart of china town. has a good selection of dim sum plus the usual staples. probably somewhere you'd only go as a tourist, but a reasonable find.",4
probably my favourite in china town,4
lovely meal,4
all though the lobster in spring onions was vey tasty the rest of the meal not very good. duck in blackbean sauce too oily and fatty  the chicken in lemon sauce was dry and was not fresh. very disappointing. they did change it for me to something different. very expensive poor quality food,2
rude staff.,1
been here a few times. had some good food but last couple of times service has been poor. items just did not arrive. even when chased they still did not arrive.,2
good place for dim sum and excellent chinese food,5
"average food, over priced, poor service and awful crowd. avoid.",1
love the dim sum,5
"great dumplings, good price, and big enough portions to share food",4
very tasty popcorn chicken. had seaweed and cheese powders.,5
the best bubble tea in town.,5
love it! i recommend the popcorn chicken and fried sea food. you can choose your own seasoning on it. really good taiwanese snack place. queue can be long at times. the chips were disappointing though.,4
"love this place so much, the plum powder on the popcorn chicken is one of the best. don't get me started on the chicken slab, simply amazing and worth the price",5
"i tried the popcorn chicken and the fried chicken.  i let them pick which seasoning.  a combination of tomato, cheese, and garlic on one was excellent.  it was very busy, but fast service.",4
most of the chicken taste good but would not recommend the large drumsticks; they are quite bland once the skin comes off.,3
be careful of the chicken breast. i took a hard bite and some burning oil went up my right nostril which left me crying for 2 minutes. otherwise good tasty chicken with a wide selection of seasoning.,4
terrible work condition but great chicken.,4
so tasty! bit of a wait but you get a good portion for the price. will definitely be coming back.,5
"delicious chicken, not greasy, very tender and juicy. also i had the taro cold tea with boba and it was delcious !",5
"the chicken meat itself is disgusting, i cannot pinpoint the pungent smell.. the thigh tastes like innards and overpowers the fried crust. i shudder to think where they source but the price is daylight robbery for such poor meat.",1
the crispiest chicken i've ever had,4
amazing chicken! the different selection of deep fried chicken or seafood coupled together with the different sprinkles options you can get make this place a must go for chicken lovers.look out for the sweet potatoes...they're huge!!!!,5
very tasty good selection,4
"one of the best chicken popcorn ive had, great money for value and made on the spot. perhaps a little less salt seasoning for me next time.",4
"good fried chicken, nothing else to say but you must try it.",4
"it was okay but ive heard a lot of rave reviews that im not sure it warrants. i had the popcorn chicken, which was a bit dry. the seasoning powders were nice but i needed to ask for more as you need quite a bit for it to be flavoursome. i probably wouldnt bother going again.",2
good deep fried chicken with great seasoning options. busy but fast service,4
big piece of chicken and big pieces sweet potato. excellent herbs and spices selection. seating is limited.,4
properly good fried chicken. had the breast with plum and garlic seasoning.,5
really good chicken. theyre always busy and its made to order so may be a bit of a wait.,5
quick service and halal. nice to have halal place around china town,5
"excellent chinese fried chicken. get the popcorn chicken and the chicken breast, plum or spicy numbing chilli seasoning. a killer dinner.",5
was hesitant at first due to the price but i didn't regret it. a really big slice of chicken seasoned however you like it. the chicken was very tender and juicy. i will order one again soon.,5
"really enjoyed it, it lived up to my expectations! chicken was delicious and boba was great too. be warned, there are almost no seats, but i ordered popcorn chicken and didnt have any problems with standing :)",5
"best fried chicken ever. the batter is the best, the chicken is also freshly fried. the seasonings are large in range which helps diversify flavour. the pricing is pretty good although it is increasing slowly. their bubble tea is also really nice, although i would not recommend the fruit teas compared to the milk teas.",5
popcorn chicken here is amazing. golden and crispy !,4
food fired chicken. slightly expensive. i recommend getting the plum seasoning on your chicken.,4
"amazing juicy fried chicken. good portion size, many different seasoning to suit your taste. always find myself grab one when i pop into chinatown",5
"loved their chicken popcorn, different seasoning available, and their volcanic chicken stuffed with cheese sinful and yummy ",4
service was poor and chicken wasn't that great. really dry and packed full of msg. not really worth the money and didn't taste like the authentic version in taiwan. good for a first try but i wouldn't really go back.,2
"it was basically unseasoned fried chicken with then some flavoured salt sprinkled on top; so the real winner here is the salt, some real good salt :)",3
just make sure you ask from the chicken skins to be extra crispy,5
"amazing value for money and a good selection of taiwanese fried chicken. my only problem is that they oversalted our food massively (but the salt is only added at the end, so you can always ask for less)",4
"love the chicken, that's all i have to say, its always so busy which is a good sign for a place to eat. always go whenever i'm in the area",5
"my favourite fried chicken shop in the capital. tasty taiwanese, popcorn chicken is awesome, forget the stuff you get in kfc. plum and chilli seasoning gets those taste buds wanting more. only negative is the lack of seating and tired interior.",5
the fried chicken is nice but wont recommend the lotus root.,4
"i love the popcorn chicken here.  nice blend of chicken and crust.  i ended up stopping by three times during my trip.  their boba is kinda bland but the tea was good.  overall, try the popcorn chicken.  its awesome.",5
this place is amazing!went into here after a night out near china town and wondered in. the food quality is very very good and you get to choose youre seasonings. staff was also very friendly and helped as i was unsure about what to get.,5
"amazing popcorn chicken, fresh fried and then a choice of like 10 different flavoured powders to sprinkle on. very crispy and good fried chicken and good value for money!",4
the fried chicken breast is the best with spices along with bubble tea. best combo ever !,5
"amazing chicken with a variety of seasoning. a little bit costly but totally worth it. my boyfriend won't stop talking about going back to the place. they have a bunch of fried options like chicken (obviously), tofu, veggies, potatoes, chicken skin, etc.",5
taiwanese style fried chicken with flavour shakers. it's good and i think lately they've been adding to the menu to give it some return custom value. it's good if you wanna try some taiwanese chicken.,3
tasty fried chicken but service always very slow!,4
awesome fried chicken. had the popcorn which is a good sized portion which small pieces of fried chicken dusted in a seasoning of your choice. plenty other options on the menu which looked good too. to try next time. good quick bite spot in chinatown,5
oh my gosh! we went there last sunday and bought two boneless breast fried chicken! they were unbelievably delicious  i didnt take any pictures cause they were too good  loads of powdered flavours to choose from and they are halal!,5
this chicken was delicious! it was juicy and crispy and a generous serving - theres two pieces in the bag. i also like that you can add any of the seasonings - i got chilli and seaweed which were so good!(nb: minimum 10 for card payments),5
"very good fried chicken, some options can be a bit dry. flavourings are amazing bit service can be a bit...brusque. still, if you're after a quick snack, you'll be more than satisfied here",4
good simple taiwanese fried chicken. perfect for a bite on the ho. have varieties of flavoured powders to choose from. price is also reasonable.,4
"really good decent fried chicken, would definitely recommend. got the popcorn chicken (a massive bag full) and bubble tea for 9 - you can choose your seasonings too once they fry the chicken. would definitely come back again. i would get this over any form of takeaway any day.",5
"oof, really good fried chicken. lots of flavour shakers to add on top. everything is deep fried so it's not healthy but yeah, really tasty...",5
great crispy squid. this is take out only though so be warned. fast service and flavoursome food.,4
longest wait for popcorn chicken!!! waited for 20 minutes... popcorn chicken was good but staff is rude! no place to sit and eat. only take away.,2
never had it before but would go again. had chicken fillets with seaweed and loved it. don't be put off by the queues as service is very quick if somewhat chaotic.,5
"not quite up to taiwans standards but this is serviceable for london. would avoid coming here for the bubble tea, it does not appear to be top notchedit: popcorn chicken is good, chicken strips are not so good",4
"a nice surprise in china town, london. just stick to ordering the fried chicken steak, no other pieces taste as good there say as a good popeye's chicken, but a good option for  trying a different assortment of sprinkled spice toppings to try on a fried chicken steak to go. surely, a must try in central london.",5
"loved the chicken popcorn and the sauce, best when served hot, halal place in london",4
my fave little fried chicken shop in the uk. fairly cheap for london as well.,5
"bought a boneless chicken thigh, which was lovely so went to buy some more. decided on popcorn chicken and they sneakily decided to give me chicken which had been sitting there quite a while and had gone cold. so i was quite disappointed the second time round unfortunately.",3
"great food, they need more space for people to eat in.",4
"tiny taiwanese fried chicken shop, which sells chicken, but it's oh so tasty. the deep fried chicken skin and the deep fried tofu are my faves but it's well worth taking the time to try everything out ",4
"very bad place.all food just deep fried .king prawn ,chicken strips.even chicken skin dump in flour.",1
good friends and good chicken. 5/5,5
"yo, best chicken out there. korean chicken wise",5
"the popcorn chicken is a hit. you get to choose the different seasoning from 5spice, plum, cheese, garlic and few more.",5
"my favourite chicken place in london! it serves the best, juiciest chicken with a huge selection of seasoning. the fact that it's always busy is a sign of how amazing it is. can not recommend this place enough for delicious fresh fried chicken!",5
we had bubble waffles from here for pudding they were so good but very sweet and sickly could only just finish it and i like sweet things.,4
great fried chicken and tasty matcha bubble tea.,5
"bubble tea can be improved, but popcorn chicken are very tasty",4
beautifully tasting succulent chicken and other goodies at good prices,5
"quick fast food, really good fried chicken (best i've had), great other options (including the bubble tea). price is very acceptable for what you're getting.",5
pretty expensive. 5 for a bag of popcorn chicken? it wasnt even that great. for that price i can get a full delicious meal at kfc..... i must be missing something..,2
nah not that great as reviews would suggest. pricey as well. 10 not enough for a meal. chicken was different but really just breadcrumb chicken with flavours sprinkled on. wouldn't recommend as there are loads better places in the area,1
"super excellent. there are some clueless reviewers here complaining about the chicken breast being big or not cut up for them. ignore them. if you like your chicken juicy and delicious and aren't snobby about eating without a fork and knife, this place is excellent.",5
absolutely disgusting. you should not eat here. the food is so delicious that nothing else will ever taste the same. should be banned.,5
tasty chicken and crunchy plum fries! i love that i can add flavour once cooked with different seasonings. definitely check it out if you are in the area. halal friendly.,5
"delicious chicken - exceptionally crisp, tender inside and tasty flavours to choose from. really friendly and helpful service too",5
it speaks for itself. london needs more of this.,5

great seasoning and breading on both the popcorn chicken the chicken breast fillet. you may have to wait a while for your order to come through though.,4
8.50 for tasty chicken breast and bubble tea. not bad for central london considering the tea could cost 4 quid alone elsewhere,5
i don't know how to describe how good this place is.,5
"amazing fried chicken!,  unlike other places. also good bubble tea!",5
so addictive! chicken breast is to go for!,5

super average.... but only one in london this convenient ,3
good for a quick bite. ,3
excellent,5
super basic but insanely good  - excellent!,5
taiwanese-style fried chicken is the best. the main attraction is essentially giant chicken schnitzels coated in a batter with plenty of umami.i also thoroughly recommend the popcorn chicken and deep fried chicken skin.,5
"great taiwanese chicken! the chicken breast is extremly juicy, tender and fried to perfection. popcorn chicken is amazing aswell. the staff is friendly amd helpful. thr bubblr tea is great. the only minus is no toiletts and the seating area and floor was dirty.",4
i love you.... you complete me.,5
food so good and cheap - check it out,4

just about the best fried chicken place in london. not the best but it's in the top 10...,5
"good, fresh and succulent chicken with a variety of dry seasonings to take the flavours to the next level. there is plenty of choice and it is a better alternative to many other chicken pages nearby.i would recommend the cheesy volcano chicken.",4
great little stop off spot on the fringes of chinatown for a quick and fulfilling snack. go spicy for the best flavour!,5
super tasty fried chicken skin and popcorn - get it with chilli/wasabi and plum seasoning. i've had the squid once and it was a letdown.,5
value for money.,4
one for the best pieces of fried chicken i've ever had. we got the chicken nuggets and chicken drumsticks (2 pieces) and the portions were quite generous. they fry the squid and the chicken separately but do check. highly recommend checking this place out. ,5
"okay, so i didnt think fried chicken could get better but out how wrong. the selection of favourings turbo charge the taste and blow your mind. quick and tatsty. the staff have a great sense of humour too.",5
this place is halal. certificate displayed on the wall,5
"decently priced and tasty, best fried chicken in china town. if you spend 10 or more in cash then you get to choose a free can of soda.",5
service is not great but the food is fast and tasty!,5
good quality of chicken. worth to try,5
"it's okay, if you want to eat something quick and the bubble tea is actually quite good. i was expecting similar fried chicken that i've had had in taiwan, but it's just not nearly as good. the batter is flaky, the chicken isn't nice and moist, and the sweet potatoes weren't all cooked through and were simply in too big wedges.",3
loving the squid and prawns. plum chips too. can't speak for the chicken options they offer but they do tasty tasty fast food,4
a bit expensive for what it is,4
chicken breast crispy hot and fresh? check!bubble tea cool and refreshing? check!i recommend going again. staff is friendly and service is quick.,5
very tasty fried chicken indeed,5
best fried chicken. try the different flavours.,5
"fried and seasoned. i bought the deep fried squid and it was great, the squid was very soft to eat and it tasted great. i tried my friends popcorn chicken which was equally as tasty. the prices are okay considering the shop is in london.",4
absolutely delicious!,5
best chicken ever !,5
fried tofu is soo good. reccomended.  large portions and cheap.,5
my favorite place to grab a bite in central,5
good but not outstanding fried chicken place with a plethora of spice options. represents decent value for money. don't expect a seat - it's very cramped and best suited for takeaway.,3

how chicken shops should be.,4
amazing fried chicken. i had mine with plum and chilli coatings. perfectly crisp and grease free ,5

very tasty food.,5
"the best fried chicken you will ever put on your mouth..... forget kentucky,  taiwan is the place for the most amazing chicken!  ",5
poor...very poor service...the staff is so rude and aggressive,1

"i ordered the popcorn chicken and the supreme boneless chicken, the first was amazing but the later was not as flavourful.",4
love filthy fried chicken! one of the best!,5
"quality fried chicken, the squid is tasty too",4
"never leave chinatown without devouring their chicken fried goods! love this place. yummy, generous portion of chicken.",5
the drumsticks we're too salty. prawns and quail eggs we're good. go for the spicy flavored salt!,3
"delicious chicken, but pricey.",4
"my girl just told me that i liked it. so, five stars",5
lovely spot for a tasty chicken to go. i was happy to see a local alternative to kfc and this one does the job.,4
love chicken skin.,5
"the chicken wings are great! get them. the squid is also delicious. the signature ""30cm"" chicken breast is actually kind of dry and not that great. that's why they lose a star. get extra cheesy powder that's the best one.",4
absolutely love this place. it is the place to go for taiwanese fried chicken in london - the highlights are the 6.50 deep fried chicken breast and the 3.90 popcorn chicken.,5
good place to eat nice food,5
"taiwanese snack, deep fried small pieces of chicken with various topping/sauce options. nothing extraordinary ",3
authentic taiwanese style fried chicken.,5
very expensive with mediocre food.,2
the fried chicken breasts are great. ,5
try their fried tofu,4
customer service was good and the place looked ok. decent variety to choose from. the chicken however wasn't very pleasant; tasted rather off.,2
lovely staff and amazing food. i often crave the fried sweet potato from there. the bubble tea is really good as well. cute small place!,5
great crispy chicken. it is good just because it is the most easily available one in central london-if you understand what i mean.,4
"if you do come here for anything, try the volcanic cheesy chicken. its expensive (like the rest of the chicken) and takes a while to prepare but the oozing, molten cheese is amazing inside the juicy, crispy chicken. ive yet to try their bubble tea but friends have recommended it.",5
"delicious chicken. you can see they make it from fresh chicken, not frozen one!",5
the quality of the chicken is rubbish. the chicken tastes likes it's gone off.,1
"fried chicken, bubble tea what's not to like!?! i have to go again to try out the different sauces/flavours! :-)",4
one of the best fried chicken place in london. perfect for a quick bite,5
great taiwanese fried snacks.  loved the fried chicken strips and fried prawn!,5
so damn good!,5
good fried chicken!,5
by far the best fried anything! the popcorn chicken and crispy squid are delicious! i recommend having your food sprinkled with the seaweed and plum seasonings - yum!,5
"nice chicken, very large portion's for the price. must try!.",5
"yummy, finally found my way here, had chicken wings, prawns and plum chips. all good, just enough between two. staff friendly despite what other reviews have said. pitched up on a stool and chatted whilst eating. i'll be back!",5
"popcorn chicken, i love you as much as a man can love fried chicken. 10 minimum spend for card is a bit annoying. at least put a sign up.",5
"look, i am not proud of my fried chicken love but you know in the name of research i had to go here. simple and delicious is the way i would put it. get a flattened chicken breast that is delightfully coated and crispy thanks to the cooking and choose what salt you want et voila! 6 for some delicious fried chicken? i'll take that.",5
plum seasoning on all the chicken and chips plz,5
"great fried chicken, with wide range of available spices",5
lotus root chips are genius,5
"quite like this place, but expensive for what it is. also, they don't take cards for a spend less than 10 which is quite inconvenient",3
unbelievably yummy chicken. plum fries were an unexpected pleasure.,5
very nice fried chicken. very juicy. i would say it's better than kfc,5

"really tasty chicken, generous portions, ramshackle setting. a good find in a hit and miss part of town. would really recommend the popcorn chicken.",4
seriously good!,4
incredible chicken paired with amazing taste powder,5
"the fried chicken breast is my favourite especially with chilli powder, also recommend plum powder or seaweed powder for those who cant eat spicy!",5
gem,5
bubble tea,5

"incredible hot pot experience, you cook your own food and there are plenty of fresh ingredient and sauce options. the broths are amazing!",5
"if you are vegan/vegetarian do not go here. they don't have a separate vegan menu as it says on the website or on their menus. when we asked them what was vegan they assured us that they could make a vegetarian dish vegan. however, their vegetarian (labelled) curry they advised had fish sauce in. obviously they have no clue. avoid.",1

good quality hotpot but can be a little pricey. you have the choice of two soup bases. meats are high quality compared to many other places i've been to in london. expect to pay between 20-30 on food.,4
"the food here is so delicious that it's my third visit here. my kids really enjoyed the food as well(do try the green cury it's so tasty ) we were served by alroy, i must say his service was exceptional as he was able to explain the menu so well. the staff was very welcoming and the food is fresh. must try this place at least once!!",5
the food was way too oily for me. and personally think they went overboard with their service. get back to me when your food is as good as your service.,1
very very friendly staff but the food is pretty basic. i did not try their speciality the 'hot pot' though.,2
lovely restaurant and romantic booth seats upstairs! delicious hot pot and thai food.,5
this is my favourite thai restaurant in london. delicious and good price.,5
"amazing experience, very authentic. we have had hot pot in taiwan and this was a very similar experience and taste.",5
"the biggest hot pot i have ever seen. tasty food, but a bit pricey - soho - tourists etc.",5
had an amazing lunch here with my gf. that's what we love about china town you find these great eateries by chance.,5
traditional hot pot. the ambiance is not amazing for the price.,4
amazing tom yum soup and mala flavour is authentic. good combination food recommend to try it.,5
"we will never go back there. the amount of food was very little, the waiter has forgotted some plate and gave us a wrong one. he even made us waited 40 minutes to give us the right one and poorly apologised. the waiter clearly didn't care. a very terrible experience..",1
therere varieties of soup! really delicious shabu  ever.,5
"the best food here, thai food is delicious loved the pad thai and the hot pot soups is very fresh with all ingredients! will be back here soon.",5
"great dinning experience. good food and expansive selection, reasonable prices for central london. the staff are really friendly and there are plenty of guides on how the concept works if you have never had a hot pot before.",4
went here with my wife: was recommended by a few friends to try their thai food and was fascinated. prices was good for value but the food blew us away- excellent food will be back!,5
"visited hot pot with my gf on monday night been wanting to try this restaurant for a while now- the restaurant was very busy. food was great, service was on point. we really enjoyed the thai food here. we saw the restaurant has great reviews so decided to check it out and saw it from instagram.",5
celebrated my birthday here as a surprise from my husband. just amazing service and delicious food.,5
"food was very good, make me miss home food!",5
delicious food and good service,4

"nice food, pleasant experience",4
"amazing food, very good value! big portions. pad thai was the best i've had!",5
hands down the best hot pot in london! the collagen soup is the perfect dish on a cold daymore pics on instagram: @rozarioemma,5
we had the pad thai and the cashew and chicken- delicious and no long wait as per some reviewers. we would return,5
everything taste just amazing,5
"the food was less than satisfactory.  the amount was tiny.  we ordered the veg option and we got exactly three tiny cubes of tofu,  one floret of broccoli,  one leaf of pak choi and half a carrot.  all of this amazing experience for central london prices. only go if you want to starve.",1
i would say hot pot london offers the best quality of ingredients with varieties of broths compare to other hotpot restaurants i have been to. staffs are friendly and provide exceptional service. also you can't miss those authentic mango sticky rice and pandan pancakes as desserts to boost your dining experience there.,5
the food was lovely but the service was quite bad. we came on a tuesday night and the restaurant wasn't particularly busy but it took so long for the food to come and we had to keep reminding them that our food had not arrived yet. they forgot our vegetable too.,3
wide range of soup and tasty hotpot sauce,5
very nice thai food.,5
"slow slow slow/ no staff. underalcoholed drinks and chaos. quite tasty food, but wouldn't go back.",2
not great. waitress never smiled once. waiter had dirty fingernails. average food costing quite a lot. 12% surprise service charge also added in the end.,2
good quality hotpot with a choice of broth/soup bases. vegetables were very fresh - enjoyed it thoroughly. excellent service.,5
"we liked everything on this place. elegant decor, with nice atmosphere; attentive and pleasant staff, and fresh food full of taste. we didn't try this time the hot-pot but would like to on next occasion. being in central london the price seemed reasonable considering overall value. thank you guys at the restaurant.",5

"the best thai food, atmosphere is vibrant with all the hot pots steaming up!",5
price very nice. pad thai and red curry was excellent.,5
my third time in 2 weeks!! excellent thai food and service.,5
had a real decent meal. service was a little slow although it was saturday evening so can't complain too much and the veg broth was a tad bland but the tom yum broth more than made up for it as it was absolutely fantastic. great selection of sides and sauces as well,4
"good food, but poor service.",3
"food very nice, tom yum and collagen soup i recommend! service was average to good, but the food fresh.",5
great traditional chinese hot pot experience we chose a split pot with chicken and mushroom stock with veg and meat platter  plenty of food for 3 people. good  service and very attentive staff,5

"loved it all. great food, great service...",5
"excellent food, halal offerings are available also.",5
one of the best hotpot in london! i love the spicy mala soup and chicken soup. they were able to satisfy my taste buds. nice experience cooking and dipping in the various sauces ,5
food was ok to good. service is slow.,4
"ive been here twice and both times have been a really nice experience for me and my friends. excellent service and the food were really yummy! i highly recommend the pineapple fried rice. we loved the atmosphere, it was like we had gone back in time! would definitely come again :)",5
"amazing thai street food, very authentic and the best i've been to in london. i've been twice and is impressed by every single dish. highly recommend and hope that the quality doesn't drop because otherwise i'll have nowhere else to go!",5
"our pork platter looks a lot less than 2 other customer's platter. also, menu makes it sound like the restaurant donates 10p to charity, but it's a forced donation added ontop of customer bill. waitess did not tell us about the sauces.",1
"excellent place! great food, awesome service, can order songs and have fake birthday!",5
this restaurant has the best of both worlds serving hot pot and super delicious thai food!!  my new favourite thai spot in london. i will be back for the hot pot next weekend.,5

"excellent food, tapas menu caters to entire family....they have started hot pot again... need to come back again for this... the selection looks extensive and moreover no need of standing in the queue for a table... antonio.. thank you for the amazing cocktail...",5
"ordered meatlovers for 2. this is the place if you are hungry and a company. this was an overload of food we could have been 4persons for this. food was amazing, best part is mixing your own sauses. great service. my best recommendations",5
"not many great hotpots in london, but i can't say the same for this place. the ingredients are fresh and the combination of different sauces as well as broths caters to multiple taste buds and cravings. staffs are kind and the service is exceptional. will definitely continue to dine there.",5
its our second time here. came back for the thai food which was amazing. probably the best thai food ive had in a long time.,5
"good thai hot pot. the sticky mango rice is highly recommended as a dessert. it usually gets busy late evening, so make sure that you book in advance if you don't want to wait.",4
good soup base especially japanese,4
"just grabbed a quick lunch visiting chinatown, food is fast and good value. love the green curry.",5
"very good hot pot place, soup bases are the best in london.",5
the best hotpot restaurant in london. fresh and great ingredients. also the service!i recommond you try mala soup! yummy,5
"compare to number of hot pot restaurants that i tried in london for the past 2 years, this place has been far better - the fresh, clean and soup broths are excellent (i had tom yum and collagen)",5
amazing high quality food. the place is really cozy and nice and great for big companies and small. great service. def go there again!,5
"the place used to be a great place for hot pot, the soup is original soup, and it was free for top up but not they charge for it. and the service is always up and down. its always difficult for a restaurant to remain good quality. the food now is less and not as better as last year.",5
"this is the best and my favourite place to eat in china town the food is amazing and very affordable, friendly staff and comfortable seats. will be back soon!",5
"i usually don't write reviews, but the food was fantastic, came here with my wife. the service good, the food probably the best asian food i've had. we will definitely be back soon!",5
"i'm very glad i managed to book a table, amazing range of cocktails and dishes were nice and unique, not like what you would find in other thai restaurants.",5
one of the best thai restaurants we have been to. came here last night there was a very long queue and i can understand why. my fiance loves thai food and she was impressed by the quality - taste is authentic. we recommend the lamb shank massaman curry and the pad thai dishes. will return soon.,5
yummy food and nice decor. the food is very good and up to a high quality. the restaurants signature dish is the hot pot where you can cook your own food in broth. we tried hot pot for the first time and the waitress explained how to enjoy the dish very well. we had a great experience.,5
authentic thai hot pot experience,5
"yum, love the food here, thank you for great service.",5
best hotpot in london. so impressed by the authenticity and freshness of every dish. staff were lovely. perfect place to go with friends and family!,5
nice seating and a novel induction ring set into each table where they give you broth to cook food yourself. looked great. we picked from the normal menu as we didn't have long before our theatre booking. the food was great and nicely presented. staff were efficient. prices were reasonable. i would recommend!,5
the staff are wonderful and polite and lovely and welcoming. the food was absolutely incredible. plenty of very creative combinations. so tasty!!! i fully recommend it.,5
terrible choice to move away from hotpot and into general dining... a real shame this place had the best hotpot in london... one day a week is just not enough.,1
"great food, great vibes, bring great company. what more is there to ask? ive never written a review for a restaurant before, but figured this was worth giving 5 stars.go for the tom yum soup. ;)",5
"the food is good but the portions are tiny. the service can be much better, ive been twice and both times meals arrived before the drinks, they forgot stuff, etc.",3
"very nice location. typical thai food. we have to wait some time for table but also without reservation we get after.. 10 minutes. also great stuff, great restaurant!!!",5
the food is insanely good and the service is super friendly,5
"a hidden gem in soho. food is really delicious. if you like hot pot or asian food, that's your place. the pad thai is amazing. staff are friendly and polite. highly recommended.",5
"it's my second time back here and the food is delicious, service could be better this time but overall was still good. but it is the food that is outstanding, its the best hot pot place for sure in uk. the mala soup is so spicy and better than in some in china. tom yum is my favourite one.",5
"the food is nice, the service was waful and the prices are too high for what you get. small dishes. plain rice near the dish (why doesn't it come as part of the dish)?? is 3.5 gbpone dish was very hot although it was not marked as one.",2
fresh food and no msg in the soup.,4
very beautiful and comfortable restaurant in china town london. thai chinese food is great.,5
nice food and friendly staff but watch the bill small extras added at the end,3
"amazing thai restaurant, dropped by here before the theatres with husband and the kids. we all enjoyed it a lot. will visit again when we are back in london.",5
this place ia closed!!!!,1
"delicious food, with impeccable service! stumbled upon hot pot restaurant by chance last night, it was super busy but the staff were very friendly and explained the menu to us and showed us how to eat. the price is good for the quality of food. the pad thai was also the best we have had ever.",5
nice food and service was good. we will recommend others to this place.,5
best hot pot restaurant in london and thai food. service is nice and taste authentic like home.,5
"the best hot pot as soup is very good, the chicken one... also the ingredients are fresh. hot pot is one of my favourite we used to eat it a lot back at home. good way to live a healthy lifestyle.",5
"pooor service!! it took more than an hour and the food still not coming, so we decided to cancel it!",1
"what a stunning place! great service, delicious food and beautiful setting! i had the standard pad thai meal, and it was definitely the best ive ever had! loved it! i also loved the concept of the sauce and topping station - fantastic idea! really authentic place!",5
"appalling service. well-intentioned, but a catastrophic evening - exceedingly slow, and forgetful. claims of being short staffed, but restaurant was not busy. food was actually alright, albeit meat for hot pot was sliced too thick. very unfortunate",1
a very wholesome meal! beautifully presented authentic thai food and amazing vibe to have lunch/dinner with friends!! would highly recommend to everyone craving hot pot!!!,5
"firstly i must say that the food is amazing !! and the staff met all my requirements as im such a fussy eater.there was a manager on duty and she made sure that me and my party were catered for the whole time of our visit. i will definitely be returning as the food ,management & service was spot on and met all expectations.",5
hot pot's pretty awesome. me and the wife got a variety beef and the variety vegetable and it was way too much for us. also the spicy broth that they offer is way spicier than you might think. proceed with caution .,5
"great food, and efficient service. thai food fresh as always. one of our favourite restaurants in china town. we have been here three times already. this time the food took a little longer, but the food was delicious so its fine.",5
"excellent hotpot experience. price was okay but the quality of meats and seafood was fantastic. we had the beef lover platter, seafood platter, and vegetables platter. plenty of food for four people. we also chose the spicy and hot and sour broths. beware the spicy broth is incredibly spicy. service was great.",5
just amazing food. such great value. couldn't recommend it highly enough.,5
great food and service. we had sharing platter to start and then i had the chicken green curry for mains..... the curry texture was excellent! will definitely visit again,5
had a quick lunch there. the pad thai chicken is the best ive had in europe. it has a sweet but salty and fragrant taste which makes it taste authentic. will bring more friends here!,5
"great food, very nice atmosphere, heart of chinatown in soho...only thing keeping it from getting a 5 star was the delay in my order...ordered spring rolls (easiest/quickest thing on the menu) and it never came...i even finished my main course ",4
simply love the food,4
great selection of asian soup for hotpot.  enjoyed cocktials decent price,5
"waiter ask me 4 times if i am alone....i had tom yum kung soup with prawns, very good but the bowl comes half empty... one minor think also is that the bolted down tables are so much against the wall that you can't move an inch !",3
great food but staff were too busy to give us prompt service,3
"enjoyed the food, authentic thai. next time want to try the hot pot but didnt have time- the waiter said it would take at least 1-1.5 hours. looked amazing!",5
excellent food and service. highly recommend this thai restaurant in china town london.,5
hotpot just like in my home country. best one in london for me. food was fast but staff can be a little more attentive.,5
"great experience overall. id prefer if the restaurant were a bit cleaner, but hot pots are really good and staff were very friendly.",5
"meats were frozen to the point of which the texture changed. service pretty much non existent, needed constant reminding.priced at a premium compared to the more local hotpot joints, which i recommend highly.",2
when they say hot. they mean hot! a really fun dinner out. lovely service. and they had a lovely dry rose on the wine list too. worth a trip....,5
"this is one of the best hidden gems in china town. food is fresh and clean unlike other restaurants nearby. the staff are friendly and actually smile. i had the sirloin steak pad thai which was beautifully plated, while my partner had the chicken katsu pad thai. it was amazing.",5
"frozen food, awful.",1
"walked into this place by surprise because it looked the nicest out of other restaurants in china town, i loved the sushi sandwich. price was good. very impressed and i recommend, saw others eating some hot soup, but we didn't have time so will try next time!",5
"first time to china town, blown away by the food here. portions are good size and great value. looks much cleaner than other restaurants around in china town.",5
"fun place. also serves other thai dishes but we tried the hotpot. you choose your base broth and then a selection of vegetables, seafood and meat to cook. easy to do and kids love it too! staff are friendly and its a nice relaxed atmosphere",4
"this place gives a lot of food for what you pay, its definitely worth it. had the couples special, loved the hot pot and it came with sushi. food was excellent, staff could be a bit more attentive but overall a great visit.",5
"was recommended here by some of my friends. good food, great location! an amazing dining experience..",5
my boi sean liked the hot pots very much,5
"excellent choice of thai food, also will try the thai hot pot upstairs.",5
"service charge was stupid especially when they forgot half our orders, making us late for the theatre.drinks were ridiculously expensive again with the stupid service charge.",1
great place to try out thai cuisine.... love the signature menu (hot pot) and the choice of fresh ingredients just makes the dining experience fantastic ...... great servers a bit over crowded at times.,5
my wife and i ate here on our way to the palace and were blown away. we loved the food and the excellent service. stop what you are doing and come to hot pot.,5
"clean n fresh sea food here for a good tasty, top for soup n others menu, i really want to visit for the other time",5
i went with a friend who is a regular customer there for years. so everyone was super nice and attentive. food was excellent and very exciting. drinks were yummy (lychee and rum? ). we loved the whole experience and the chrysanthemum tea was great!,5
"amazing dinner, went today before watching the show. we are from san fran and have had a lot of hot pots but this one their ingredients are definitely the freshest and the broths were very tasty. keep it up!",5
"friday night spent well in, before theatre show, it was getting quite busy but food was served quickly, service was good. we really loved the hot pot- the green curry broth with rice was amazing. the meat and vegetable was fresh. coming back for my husbands birthday.",5
"excellent food, but service could be better. food came a bit slow but it was really tasty. we understand as it was a very busy night, all the tables were full.",5
"read other reviews and understand why the feedback is good. the food is very tasty. the price is also very affordable. found out they are part of a thai based chain with more than 150 restaurants, so they know what they are doing! hope they open one near where we live in croydon.",5
i had much better thai food before. the ambience upstairs is good. i had much better thai cuisine when i've stayed in shanghai,2
high quality and fresh hot pot similar to what we tried in taiwan. service was also very good! staff were friendly.,5
"mediocre food, expensive bill, wiping your table even as you're paying",2
it was delicious!,5
good tasty food but i ate beijing duck that was suppose to be for two people alone and it still wasn't enough for me. the portions of duck could have been bigger and this is the only thing that brings down the one star.,4
we have seen the sign specialist of peking duck. but the roasted duck was not like the one of golden dragon. we want to try something els. service was oke only they have to improve there english.,3
friendly staff and great food! their dim sum and duck are both very nice. i have no idea how they got some of the bad reviews.,5
food was good and serving was nice. however tables are crowded. there is even a table under a bar,4
"hubby and i were craving dim sum, but weren't able to go during the daylight hours.  we walked by this place after seeing a play and saw they had a late night dim sum menu with the main staples. everything we ordered was delicious, and service was quick and friendly! we will come back here the next time we visit london!",5
"very good food, only missing szechuan duck ont he menu, otherwise perfect",5
"food was amazing had starters mains and deserts and the custard dim sums blew us away, staff were friendly and very attentive will definitely be coming back when in london, coke was slighty expensive for my liking though all and all was a great visit and a lovely restaurant.",5
decent dim sum. very busy atmosphere. fun people watching and meeting strangers if you are up for that sort of thing.,4
"average food, average service.",2
amazing.,5
good food.,3
very good chinese restaurant,5
we really enjoyed the food/meal that we had in the restaurant but found the service appalling. staff we too quick to try to take away food not yet finished & bought out some of the meal far too quickly.,3
best duck ever!,5
excellent dim-sum!,5
meant to be the place to go for duck in chinatown. dont bother. we ordered half a roast duck which came out with gravy poured over it with the skin limp and just not edible. stir fried mixed vegetables were also bland and when i bit into a mushroom there was a hair attached to it.,1
"ok, same as the rest of the chinese restaurants in town. have yet  to find one that's extra special aside from the one in nuneham courtney.",3
"awful experience - very poor food, rude and argumentative staff. should have known better when i saw how filthy the kitchen was on the way to the loo and left straight away!lots of good restaurants nearby... avoid this one!",1
"lovely restaurant, the duck & pork were fantastic, glad i stopped in",5
"great food, good service, great atmosphere!! tried their duck, mixed meat egg noodles and coconut prawn soup(the last was out of this world), strongly recommended!!",5
great dim sums!,4
in a middle of the tourist mess of the london china town :)inexpensive. fast service.feels like 4*- or rather 3*+.but tastes more chinese. maybe because of only chinese ingredients used.,4
"good food, friendly staff.",4
their dim sum is really good,5
service and attitude are bad but still cost you 12% service charge.  food is cold. chicken is raw. coca cola is expensive cost 3.,1
"tasty food, good value and service.",5
best handmade dim sum in london chinatown! good service and very tasty food. i will definitely be returning here,5
"the roast duck is not very good,  some older bits mixed into the portion, and not cheap.",2
"overrated. i've visited multiple chinatown restaurants across the globe, and was very excited to eat here. outside of the spicy pork dumplings, everything was disappointing. save yourself time and money, and go someplace else.",2
"popped in here with a friend for dinner and ordered the crispy duck sharer menu. everything was freshly prepared and absolutely delicious. perfect crispy duck, sumptuous dim sum, and two meat dishes to finish. plenty of great food for a great price. absolutely recommend.",5
not worth the price plus they only give you one scallop which is ridiculous! waiter was rude also but the noodles were alright,2
the porridge / congee was good. we also had some vegetables/ seafood dimsums. my friend had the roast duck. maybe a bit pricey; for what it was.  food was delivered fast though,3
"my most favourite chinese restaurant in china town. very good roasted duck, not too sweet sauce.",5
"if u're ready to wait outside like 25min, come !food is great, and generous ! a bit expensive though",4
good value for central london. portion sizes are average. the meals themselves were generally quite tasty although nothing special.,3
decent food. liked the crispy duck and the dim sum. waiters are hectic.,4
"good dim sums,  crispy duck and veggies.",4
delicious foods. my favourite place in china town,5
"we had booked another restaurant before a comedy night but it was closed and needed to eat quick. walked into chinatown and found this gem, we had a set menu which was fantastic and good value.",5
"mmmmm we got the crispy duck, it was amazing!!!! we got a bunch of other things too and it was all delicious. great service.",5
"2 stars because the food was good. but with poor service, add stuff that you never ordered on your bill which they need a couple of tries to sort it out and then they force you to tip them without giving you any heads up before you order. i mean why would they care about good service if they force you to tip them anyway?",2
"quite nice dim sum in london. soup dumplings were almost like the real thing, great flavor",4
used to like this place as it has good food and never too busy. now the service has gone really downhill to a point they are just plain rude to customers. in chinatown there are plenty of other places offering the same food with better service. i'll not be going to this place ever again,1
amazing crispy duck and crispy beef. authentic flavours. good pricing and nice staff,5
great selection of food. good service. got a table as soon as we walked in. it was after the lunchtime rush in the middle of the week though. a little pricey for just two people. the more the merrier i think. i think they have some tables upstairs setup for larger groups. well worth going just for the steamed sea bass.,5
we loved it here! every dish ordered tasted simply delicious. the duck and dim sum was amazing. the staff were brilliant with children and it felt so christmassy inside! thank you,5
"nice, clean restaurant. staff were accommodating and helpful. food was nice, but not a huge nunnery of options for vegetarians/ vegans.",4
really good food and great service,5
really tasty and value for money,5
amazing menu and attentive friendly service - but unfortunately the quality wasn't what i would have hoped for in chinatown.,3
chef's menu is much too expensive for what it is worth!,2
"excellent food, good service & very pleasant",4
prices are fine for what servoce and food you get. service is fast and smooth. definitely worth a try if you crave for spm asian food. and the food itself is rich in flavour.,5
below average food and decidedly poor service. rice served on plates rather than bowls seemed odd.,2
ok food. good place for tourists.,4
very good food for affordable price,5
"it was busy and a little later so we tried it as it was busy, but i would avoid it if honest. everything was over-cooked, crispy/dry or tasteless. not the worst i have had, but far from the best.",2
not a place i would return to. not very welcoming,2
"food below average standard and not fresh either like take out from fridges, fairly overpriced for dishes. was charged 1 for water.",2
"like all things in chinatown, it took some exploring to find this place, but it is very good. prices are pretty reasonable and the food is great (gotta have the duck!). best advice i can give is go in a group of 3-4 people max - you would be waiting quite a while if you go with more than 4",4
espectacular roast duck dumpling and glutinous rice in lotus leaf,4
"really good food, but cramped setting.",4
quite nice peking duck! staff is very helpful,4
used to be best in chinatown. really gone downhill. lots of michelin stickers on door but food is really poor,2
food is quite good here. price is reasonable if you know what to order. the usual hong kong based dishes will be fine. the food will be up to mark. can't expect much for this price range. service can be improved typical of chinatown (except for high end) restaurants. it is just beside the 2 four seasons restaurants at gerrard street.,4
great dim sum just watch oot if ypu are english you get the right priced menu.,4
"great food, good service and reasonable prices for the area. dim sum in particular is well worth trying.",5
valentine for love happiness just showing my happiness,5
"amazing food in an amazing location, went for lunch, was in and out in 30 mins (which is great as i only had a lunch hour) and never flet rushed at all. food hot, quick and very tasty!",5
"sezchuan chrimp was good and also the sweet and sour chicken, add some chinese brocoly and your good to go ! ",4
one of the better dim sum places in china town. ,4
"highly recommend the set meals that they offer, you get so much for your money",5
average food.,2
"fast service, great food and great value! ",5
they were supposed to accept taste cards on a sundays but when i visited they refused to accept because they'd rather save the tables for customers who didn't use taste cards.,1
set menu food wasn't bet good.,2
great place!!!!,5
"good cantonese dim sum , general dishes for dinner ok too , a tad dearrr service charges comparing to other nearby competitors ",3
outstanding. simply the best chinese meal i have ever had .. and i've been to china!,5
aromatic crispy duck and satay crispy chicken all very good. nice service.,4
"haozhan,worst restaurant in china town. hostile staff, overpriced dishes, and looooooong waiting time for food. taste average. will avoid this place in future. there are many better restaurants in the area that i would dearly recommend, but not this one. ",1
always good dim sum at a good price. best to go with a big group and sit upstairs.,4
very tasty food. try the peking duck and sweet and sour chicken.,5
tasty and varied. a good range to suit more or less adventurous palates.,4
food was okay. not very good though. bit overpriced.,3
"always eat here if i'm in chinatown. great food. good, quick, no nonsense service. ",5
"delicious food, amazing atmosphere and reasonable prices.",5
"worst experience i have ever had. first time i have given a review too. the waitress was very rude, dumping the food on the table and walking off constantly. would have received better hospitality at mcdonald's. never smiled, much better restaurants in chinatown. ",1
really good restaurant for authentic chinese food. the roast duck is great. will be back for more...,5
great and refined food. horrible service. we were pushed out of the restaurant.,3
we had the couple set and it was too much. i wish we had ordered just the crispy duck coz that was really good. the rest was nothing special. ,4
food is not freshly cooked...the raw vegetables are tired.,2
christmas!!!!out of the sudden they dont accept credit card anymore but only cash and triple / double their price!!!!chinese tea for 7.00 when they normally sell it for 1.00 !!!!not to mention the worst waitress ever !!!!! i met it there.,1
genuine chinese. try the crispy duck,4
"the chilli soft shell crab and mongolian fillet beef are superb. great service too, very friendly staff.",4
got right royally ripped off here they brought us a dish we didn't order and got all shirty when we told them.60 lunch for 2!go elsewhere.,1
"friendly staff (unlike a lot if restaurants in chinatown!), good food, reasonable prices.",4
great set menus,5
i entered the restaurant because there was a michelin sticker at the entrance.  but the taste and service are normal,3
imo best duck rice ever tasted,5
i'd recommend the crispy duck and sea bass here. food is good.,3
average,3
so good!,5
roast duck with rice yum :) tables a bit close together and staff distracted by their radios when taking your order but the food was good,4
new owners and not the haozhan i used to know ,2
expensive place to eat ,5
just excellent amazing,5
highly recommend. ,5
"ok, not bad ",3
lovely sweet and sour bean curd meal,4
fantastic roast duck,5
"noting special, average china town fare.",3
incredibly yummy food and definitely feels a lot nicer than many of the places in china town - however that does come with a price tag!,4
fast delicious food. slightly cramped.,4
"average food. the sign outside said optional 12.5% service charge, though we were told that it was mandatory. also, we were charged 3.50 for prawn crackers we didn't ask for. ",1
"good food, nice dim sum.",5
cantonese restaurant serving main dishes and dim sum. price is fair but not really authentic in cantonese cooking style.,3
the food was okay. they want you to go to the cash point to pay cash. this is the first option and is pushed as the payment method. they only got card machine when asked.,1
"fairly average food, fairly reasonable price ",3
best aromatic duck we have had in years!,5
excellent dim sum at any hour.,4
"very tasty food, good service",5
best noodles in soho ever,5
nothing special but not bad for what they do.. ,3
food was ok. service was average. service charge was high and not optional (even for a party of two).,2
very good noodles. soups are not bad too.,4
yumm yumm,4
"ok nothing too special, food and service is only average i'm afraid. better restaurants in the area.",2
"good chinese, great duck and the deep fried crispy squid starter was delicious",4
restaurant in china town. good value and good food. everything is quite fast especially when they are busy. that's good of you have other things to do. ,4
good for theatre break. loved the starters in particular.,5
best dumplings ive had outside of australia.,5
"damn son, that's good dim sum!",5
"great 14 set meal , highly recommend.",5
the crispy duck is one the best i've tried. the beef curry is delicious too. i've been there a few times and i'll be back.,4
food is nice and fair price. service is so so.,4
"food was average, but the staff and service were very bad.  i wouldt recommend it.",1
did anyone else eat here around the 6th march 2019 and everyone got sick?,1
"i have lived in asia for more than 10 years and this is the best duck i've ever had! the other foods were pretty good, as was the service, but the duck was outstanding. highly recommended if you want duck.",5
"delicious!!! quick service with good staff, duck excellently cooked, crispy chilli beef the best i've had..crispy and melt in the mouth. very highly recommend this place.",5
"worst restaurant ever\ a viter absolumentbad service, bad food,  rude and agressive staff. they took back the food before we end it. and when they serve us the second type of food they told us that we only have 10 min to eat before they close the restaurant.",1
sometimes i come to pick up a takeaway container of pork belly. its quite tasty and the sauce they provide with it is a good accompaniment.,3
"a bit dark,tables are very closed to each other,nothing special for yum cha.",3
"excellent service and food. if you're an american, be prepared for a real experience as this is nothing like the ""chinese"" food to which you're accustomed, in a good way.",5
nice quick cheap chinese meal in china town.,3
"fantastic food, great service and reasonably priced. must go of your on the area!",5
"good szechuan food, dim sum at lunchtime",4
over priced for what you get. bit of a tourist trap. people serving were not welcoming or helpful. we walked away hungry and disappointed.,1
just amazing,5
"i just love the mixed plate with char shu, chicken, duck and white rice. with the sauce on the side it is to die for.",5
"nice place in london chinatown, they do really good deals.",4
"they kicked us out when we are still drinking tea, what a lovely service ",1
great service.,5
"in love with the crispy aromatic duck. the food was so good. this place is not the cheapest one, but it worth it.",5
great cantonese / chinese cuisine. been there a fair few times now and dishes seem to be consistent.,4
highly recommend the roasted duck and bbq pork,4
great food great value,5
"overall food is okay. they really dont know how to make dim sum, especially soup dumplings just falling apart. raised it with the water and the new batch was as bad.",3
the roast duck was delicious - although it would be better if the sauce wasn't poured over the ducks skin to preserve more crispyness. the chinese broccoli with garlic sauce was nice but could have used a little more garlicy flavour.,4
food is good but service was lousy. not just bad. really awful.i went for the duck reviews. i won't go back.,3
"our party of 5 enjoyed a tasty and timely pre-theater dinner of crispy duck with pancakes and several vegetable sides with a slightly updated edge.  the waiter was gracious, knowledgeable and respectfully helpful.  while a bit more expensive than others in the neighborhood, the quality and consistency was well worth it.",5
"lovely food, nice and warm friendly place",5
nice dim sum and congee. too much mei jin makes you thirsty. a little disappointed the restaurant charged me gbp4.8 plus 10% for a bowl of plain congee. this is supposed to be cheaper than a bowl of plain rice.,3
"great cuisine in the heart of china town.  there are many choices, but glad we selected haozhan.  if you like duck, they specialize in duck.  we ordered a variety of dishes and enjoyed each of them.  portion size and price were good.",4
so delicious,4
best duck in the world!,5
the duck was a bit dry and the waitress unfriendly. would not recommend.,3
"excellent. been in uk for two years. among the better chinese restaurants. in contrast to four season and goldmine, service is way better. roast duck is comparable or even better!",5
"very good if you go for ordering dim sum to share. same price level as the restaurants around (even though the prices aren't posted on the menu outside, you will see them before ordering).much more cosy upstairs than visible from the street, so try to sit there if possible.",5
very delicious. the crispy pork is amazing.,5
amazing restaurant with the best dim sum in london. the staff is efficient and you get your food very quickly. love it!,5
"before entering we said we have a tastecard. while asking for the bill the cashier was the rudest woman i have ever met and denied the use of the tastecard, said we must speak to her before.horrible experience for a paying customer. avoid at all costs.",1
i thought it would be better. i had great expectations maybe.,3
stopped in for a set menu meal on our way to a show. great food at good value. excellent place for a quick pit stop.,5
"all was just simply ok, will i return no thank u.",1
"it's impossible to try every dish in one sitting so it could be hit or miss. but with the roasted meats displayed in the window you can't go wrong. the chicken, the pork and the duck, over plain rice, are outstanding. will be back to try more dim sum and hopefully add to this review. ",5
any asain foods you need get it here !,4
"great chinese, dumpling platter was fantastic, great duck pancakes too. also pork belly was very tasty and i'm not normally a fan of mains. good choice if you are in chinatown!",5
crispy duck? more like boring dry and uncrispy... expencive,3
one of my favourite places to eat bbq crispy skinned duck. i would go just for that!,5
really like the yam and sweet potato pearls!! what an awesome creation.,4
not bad. i prefer bubble tea then fruit flavour slush. service was fine. :),4
however the que system is not very good and at first glance you dont know where to que its all worth the wait. i definitely reccomend the lemon green tea on a sizzling hot day.,5
"super cute little shop, great milk tea",5
the service is fast. faster than a bullet train.  and milk tea was delicious as well. i ordered the mango and orange green tea which i recommend.,4
loveee happy lemon! my favourite drink is warm milk tea with tapioca and pudding.,5
"their bubble tea is more creamier tasting, and less of the 'tea' taste if that's what you enjoy then go for it. recently they've brought out some new snacks and cakes and they're amazing! make sure you try the crab floss cheesecake/sponge cake square thing. (i don't know what its called)",5
"my favorite milk tea so far in london. but i hope they allow their customers to use their own reusable cups. i asked before but was told it is against company policy. if coffee shops allow it, why can't they?",3
better than coco which recently opened 5 minutes away from here.,5
i enjoyed my bobba! it's was really good :),5
i only like one drink here. the classic lemon jasmine tea cold drink. its so refreshingly delicious for afair price. the place is too small and not comfortable for waiting.,4
such a shame that this cafe is so behind the times with its plastic use. not only do they sell their drinks in plastic cups with a non recyclable lid and straw but they also hand it out in a plastic bag!its awful. especially when you see that their customers leave their empty cups in the street.,1
"the tea was sooooooooo sweet nothing like chinese happy lemon, and the waitress was very very rude, no smile at all, wont go there anymore.",1
"love it!  great little bubble tea shop, i shall be back soon.",5
way too sweet. i was not asked the dose of sugar or ice unlike other brands. the waitress was not smiling at all.,2
was very tasty. just like bubbleolgy but i got bits of mango in my tea. didnt like that.,4
love love love! very nice bubble teas!,5
my personal favourite bubble tea joint up town. more fruity and a sensible amount of sugar!,5
good bubble tea! they have interesting flavors.,4
strong lemon flavour almost like lemon curd. was really nice just wish i lived closer.,5
"too expensive, but good!",3
dirty bubble tea....,1
"a new place for me, drink was so refreshing, passion fruit and lemon. bit pricey but it was a day out so once was fine.",5
very busy,5
i like lemons,5
okay,3
happy,4
"nom nom nom. standard ice tea, good.",5
"i usually go the bubble tea next door, but sometimes it's overbusy so i go to happy lemon instead. the quality is great, they have a lot of flavours but not everything is listed in the menu. their bubble teas are quite consistent, next time i'll try medium size.",5
was a 5,5
corrected my order with no fuss and no extra cost after i forgot to ask for tapioca pearls. very kind! also the bubble tea hear is top notch!,5
"everything is just a bit too sweet. tried the milk bubble tea and didnt have a say on the sweetness like other places and also tried the crepe cake. unless you like your crepes slathered in whipped cream, its nothing special.",2
"i have tried the classic bubble tea with tapioca which was really nice. the service was ok but i was quiet disappointed with the amount of ice that came with the drink. half the cup was filled of thick ice, no wonder it finished so quickly, that's not very good practice. i may give it another try without ice this time.",3
"they got my order wrong: i asked for a taro milk tea and when i got it the tea was not purple and tasted like a normal milk tea! if theyd ran out id have rather been told than given one i dont like! service was fast however i wasnt asked what sweetness/ice level i wanted,",2
"loved their brown sugar boba, perfect amount of sweetness (for me). small place but fast service. we had to wait 15 mins because of the queue but it's worth the wait! surely coming back.",5
tried their oolong roasted milk tea and added pearl. the drinks was good but i find the pearl somewhat lacking. it will be great if they improve on their pearl,4
"me and my sister visited this place in the summer. taiwanese bubble teas made from freshly brewed loose leaf teas and using fresh organic milks. vegan-friendly soya, almond and oat milk options available too. we had the tea with the tapioca balls.",5
i have been going to happy lemon for as long as i have been happy. i am truly on my way to achieving eternal happiness.,5
"a good choice of bubble tea on offer and the price is normal for london's bubble tea shops. the snow/cream cloud is delicious. if you like cheesecake, get it since it gives that kind of savoury/sweet taste.",5
a great place!!!,5
no trip to china town would be complete without a stop off here. great teas always busy but worth the wait,5
"went three times while in london. the red bean matcha smoothie is amazing and my favorite!! i recommend, however, this particular tea isnt for everyone but there are plenty of other options available.",5
"really good flavours, nice staff",5
always have a long cue whenever i come by but everything is worth it once i have my favourite drinks.,5
this place remains one of the best boba milk tea in london. quite small and crowded.,5
great place,5
"yummy milk tea and cheesecake. its a bit let down by the staff, since there always seems to be a lot of them crammed behind the counter and they talk among each other a lot, distracted.",3
"my favourite bubble tea place of those around in central london. similar price, but larger choice and nicer teas available.service is friendly, although there can often be queues outside.",5
one of the better tasting bubble milk tea places ive been to! various variety but i cant speak for the fruity ones as i stick to my milk-teas.,5
"the classic milk bubble tea is nice, but a girl staff is quite rude. felt disappointed in the attitude of the staff!!",1
good milk tea.,5
huge range of bubble tea flavours! was a bit sceptical about trying the taro flavour but im so glad i did - the milk teas are creamy and flavourful and the tapioca pearls are cooked well. theres even a bench to sit on while you wait for your order.,5
nice milk tea. but need to wait for a while.,5
"it's ok, but it was neither happy nor lemony staff seem to not want to be there. good tea though, made from the tears or resentful staff... i jest",2
always great time. efficient staff!,5
"best bubble tea for miles, only place that stands toe-to-toe with this joint is the one two doors down but they seem to be out of a lot of flavours all the time. happy lemon is reliable, not crazy expensive and delicious, staff are friendly and resourceful but it wouldn't hurt them to expand the menu a bit, switch it up a bit.",5
"nice bubble tea in a crowded area. the japanese cheesecake surprised me, so smooth!",4
"worst customer services   i've been to happy lemon lots of time, the drinks are nice but all the staff are always rude to me, i don't understand why but they look angry all the time. even with london branch or birmingham branch.",1
a little slow but worth the wait. don't be fooled by the surrounding shops! there's a reason this one is the only one with a queue!,4
loved it!,5
great milk tea with a lot of choice.,5
love this place!! its worth it the wait!,5
"haven't drink their milk tea for a while and came back today for a large og milk tea with taro ball. not only they poured the faulty milk tea into mine, they mixed ""black pearls"" with taro balls. just realized when i opened it at home. very disappointed and not impressed at all.",2
"i asked for a taro milk tea but it had no taro taste, at all. after asking, they claimed this is their taro milk tea. i had taro milk tea many times before so i know how it tastes. i don't like when people think i'm stupid.the bubbles were not fresh, either, they were too hard and starchy in texture.",1
one of the cheaper bubble teas in london and its good too,4
one of the best bubble tea in ukhighly recommend,5
"milk tea was tasty and creamy, but the asian lady at the cashier was very hasty, mean, and definitely no manners. i wish they had better customer service.",1
just order the taro milk tea with taro balls. trust me.,5
one of the best milk tea that i have in london. small tiny shop but quick service.,5
"quite good, pass it often whenever i go to london so i get it most of the time when at london. for avid bubble tea fans, no option to control sugar but you can control heat. got the mango milk tea this time, with a mix of popping boba and tapioca. mango tea tasted like regular milk tea, in my opinion. staff were quite friendly.",4
we were just asking about the cheesecake and the workers acted like it was so hard to reply. acting like were stupid. so we just left. why give your money to people who dont have basic manners.,1
always nice to grab a fruit tea here.,5
great classic bubble tea cold or hot(sometimes the hot isnt always hot but theyre usually happy to change it). they need to stop charging 50p to use the card machine on payments under 5! but other than that its good,5
bubble tea from here is the best in the world i would say,5
cheese tea = delicious!!!,5
lovely smoothie,5
service was good but it didn't taste that good. also quite expensive,4
really great! would recommend the hand crafted lemon black tea,5
some really good bubble tea and was a super cute place.,5
the milk teas here are great. they are sweet on normal sugar level so ask for less sugar. you cant even ask for less ice or no ice. i have tried the other fruit teas here and they do taste more artificial and overly sweet.if you go for a milk tea here you cant go wrong!,4
great milk tea and cheese cake.,5
hell yes best bubble tea,5
"the milk teas here are nice and tasty. there's no option to control the level of sugar in the drinks, though it's neither too sweet or bland. mainly tried the fruit flavoured bubble teas, which are delicious.",4
"quick service even on very busy day. coconut milk tea and mango green tea are my favourite one :). the shop is also very cute looking, definitely on my list of top places ti get a drink. would recomend it to socially awkward people just like me (no awkward moments or incidents in the time i have been there)",5
happy but long wait,5
very nice!,4
the best bubble tea in london. you can chose from lot of options. i love them.,5
good bubble tea outlet,4
great bubble teas. always busy.,5
best bubble tea in londonnice teanice service,5
one of the better ones,4
bad tapioca bubbles :/,1
rock salted cheese is amazing drink.,5
quick service for some great bubble tea.,5
"reasonable prices, wonderful staff and tasty beverages! ",5
best bubble tea in chinatown!,5
interesting bubble tea drinks - including one with salted cheese,4
classic bubble tea flavours. my fav in london.,5
happy lemon is the best tea shop for healthy fresh tea and milk tea with the friendliest most helpful staff i recommend you visit soon .,5
"buy 3 drinks, two add triple pearls and the other only add single. but when i get home, the topping look the same, i can not distinguish which add triple preals which add single, even there had a label on the cup. ",1
service was a bit slow as there was only one staff member working but was very friendly,4
tasty but pretty expensive for a drink.,3
rock salt drinks are definitely a must try here at happy lemon. don't mind the crowd - the queue moves very quickly ,4
"nice refreshing tea, small shop que went outside the door, servjce was quick. ",3
very good! almost comparable to the happy lemon in the us,5
"bubble tea was okay, prices are high and you can only pay by cash. wouldn't recommend seeing as there are about 5 better ones nearby and one is literally next door.",2
good bubble tea! best in chinatown,4
the best bubble tea in london.the tea ready like taiwan style.,5
the best bubble tea i ever had!!,5
really good chocolate mint tea! will be back to try the other flavours ,4
good quality and fast service,4
one of the best bubble tea places in london! love it.,5
i started to hate happy lemon because of this brunch !!! i dont understand why the taste of my (always the same order) doesnt taste the same? manchester stuff they know their work much better,2
"their cream crown style boba is honestly my favorite style of boba on the planet. the cream crown is lightly salted, which actually really works with a sweet tea or milk tea. my go to order is the classic milk tea with boba, but with the cream crown.",5
best bubble tea. delicious. the staff are very nice too. i'm a frequent customer,5
"big selection of bubble tea! i can never decide whether i like cuppacha or happy lemon more, so i just keep alternating the two. it's always pretty busy here, which i take as a good sign. pro tip: ask to adjust your sugar and ice levels (i always go for 'less sugar' and 'half ice' to cut down on the sweetness a bit)",5
"customer service is terrible. i asked what the salted cheese was about. she to pointed at the first list, i picked one...wasn't salted cheese...wasted my money",1
amazing selection of drinks..,5
extremely bad customer service. took the wrong order and blame on the customer. really nice shot!,1
my best tasting milktea so far in central london..,5
small store so often a line but not a long wait. the tapioca pearls and taro balls are consistently fresh. this place does the best cream on top version.,5
i always go to grab a drink here whenever i find myself in chinatown.,4
"great bubble tea  and amazing cheese cake, really enjoyed it.",5
never disappointed ,5
the cake wasn't so good as i imagined,2
"great matcha drinks and bubble tea, unreasonably busy though, the shop was way too crowded and service wasn't the fastest.",3
awesome service! remember my usual drink each time i visit.,5
"really good, but busy",5
"nice,  a bit expensive and no lychee flavour! ",3
"very strange thing to try) but funny and childish! many chemicals in this tea tho, imho",4
wonderful drinks and best service :),5
the service here can not be more rude. not only in the tone but also in their body language.,2
"as a taiwanese, i didn't like it at all. the drink was (i think) added with a lot of artificial flavor.",2
liked it overall though i won't be rushing back. the chocolate tiramisu boba was just chocolate milk. my friend's taro milk tea was too sweet and didn't really taste of taro at all. this place also lacks variety and the prices are a bit high. i prefer cuppacha next door.,3
standard little bubble tea shop. ,3
i will rate 3,3
exactly the same as in china!,4
poor custemer service!!! never being treated rudely like that before ..,1
the mango lemon smoothie is great for summer!,5
"serves great variety of tasty bubble tea. small place, efficient and quick service.",4
went to get some bubble tea but did not have any cash on me.. was told i would have to pay 50p as it was under 5... as this is not inline with uk law i did not purchase and walked away.,1
"out of all the bubble tea places, this is probably the most unique with its baked sea salt cheese topping option. it's like drinking a yummy cheesecake! ",4
the worst service ever! the waitress there is beyond rude.,1
the only bubble tea place i would go in china town,5
always too much syrup,1
great bubble teas! ,5
"the guy ignored me completely as i tried to get his attention for a whole minute, he served me rudely, and then went on to charge me 50p to pay with a card even though its illegal. i only rated 2 because the drink was ok but not served with care.",2
"best bubble tea place in london. would only go for the original milk tea though, other options are made with artificial flavors.",4
"fell in love with their drinks but not so much for the shop. strategically located in london's chinatown, but it's a shame that the shop is way too small to accommodate the number of patrons especially during peak times.",4
"this is definitely one of my favourite places for bubble tea (boba) in soho. i adore their taro however be warned most of the flavours are extremely high in sugar. oh and don't mind the queue it moves extremely quickly. my recommendation: taro milk tea, half sugar, ice and tapioca ",5
ok bubble tea. pretty ok service even as a chinese speaker.milk tea tasted like bathroom cleaner,1
bubble tea here is amazing :) one of my favourites when i visit london,4
no salt cheese for today.,4
salted cream cheese crown is amazing,4
lovely bubble tea and cake quick and yummy,5
"they have the best japonais cheese cake in london with 3 different sizes ( s , m , l )3.39.512.5",4
"friendly staff, excellent and swift service and a wide range of bubble tea flavours to pick from. would strongly recommend the chocolate mint, oreo. keen to try the yakult one (:",5
"great bubble tea, but had run out of aloe...",4
love it. always tastes amazing.,5
good bubble tea.,4
one of the most popular bubble tea shops in mainland china has come to london. if you want bubble tea this is the place to go,5
my friend tells me it's the best bubble tea in london. i have not tried them all yet but it's a solid contender within the ones i did. ,5
myself and my friend's phone both got stole in the shop. the staff was not helpful. be careful at that store.,1
oh ! it is the best bubble tea in the london!  the shop is very popular and the staff is very friendly! i will definitely come back!,5
"delicious drink, but closed 20 minutes earlier than advertised.    the entire staff was there with the window open and they closed the door in our face. if times incorrect then change the information.",2
love the drinks and cakes but the customer service is appalling!!! ,1
good taste and the tapioca pearls were chewy and tasty. the shop has loads of interesting flavors to try it's pretty popular.,3
"the fluffy cheescake is very good. it's better that what i tasted in osaka, japan",5
"i love the tea but the service is not the best,  would think they are more like a sour lemon not happy at all",4
the japanese light cheesecake is superb!,5
this is the worst bubble tea in soho.you can get better one at the next bubble tea shop.,1
mango lemon tea on a hot day - this is the place!,3
"the best buffet in london, for 10 you can eat very delicious food. the best is the sweet & sour chicken.me and my family enjoyed it :)",5
great service an tasty food,4
the food was nice enough but not a huge range. located on a very nice chinatown street which was very lively and looked nice at night.,3
"good restaurant. free buffet, quality food.",5
food is not bad but boss is very unpleasant person. he called for security when we asked him about wrong price on our recive. no coment...,1
friendly atmosphere. food tasty but some a bit tough. limited with choice. mainly chicken.,3
"the chicken is raw, the food is oily and disgusting, the price is too high for the garbage food",1
"great place, i wish to take home but they told me only here ",5
the food & choice was good also good value for money,4
next time if you want the best chinese in london visit karwoo in stepney green and forest gate,1
this was a great surprise  for an afternoon snack.staff great and friendly. ask them what's in the dishes and they're happy to explain.food's tasty. east as much as you like.,4
staff were brilliant and made sure my 2 children had a lovely visit.,4
amazing place cheap and it's all you can eat,5
not the greatest offering. choice very limited staff didn't want give as a second set of knives and forks.,2
"food was good & tasty, staff very attentive but you must watch that when paying they give you the change its cash only and they kept my change until i asked for it to be returned we wonder how many tourist have had the same.",3
"the food is good but staff refilling the empty trays from the buffet area was on delay, the place is quite small so the price (12.95 per person) it's a little bit high. friendly staff, clean place...yes, naybe i'd come back again any other time",4
for the price (around 13 pounds) very very good. wide range of choices and fresh too. good service to top it off. i'd pick this over the other buffet places in the area.,5
excellent  very good value for money food was good hot and accessible  eat as much as you liked!! decor could have been better but it's the food that counts!! and that was good,5
"fantastic food, very welcoming employees, regularly good character. they charge fair pricing and the food quality is good. keep up the good work.",5
"one of the best places that you can eat at, the staff were very friendly and helpful, they were also quick with taking dirty dishes off the tables. i would recommend it for everyone!",5
"tasteless food, very limited choice, too expensive, generic subpar chinese buffet. staff was lovely though",2
"surely the best chinese all-you-can-eat buffet restaurant in chinatown. a great selection of food, always fresh/regularly replenished, great value, licenced to sell alcohol and friendly staff. there's nothing not to love!",5
decent food and friendly atmosphere. the staff were very good and on the ball.,4
"all you can eat,one of the better looking food selections for the all you can eat restaurants that we saw in china town, good tasting food , decent meat portions in the meat dishes but plenty of vegetable alternatives if needed, nice freindly staff. but cash only.",4
go if you are really hungry and you will be fully satisfied!,4
reasonable prices and a good selection of buffet food. food was very nice. satay chicken very nice and the noodles. well worth a visit. i will certainly use again.,5
"i visited hong kong buffet while on a visit to london with wiltshire college, and i have to say they really exceeded all my expectations. it was a phenomenal experience from start to finish, i went for a cultural dish of chicken nuggets and chips and it was amazing, without a doubt the best part of my trip to london.",5
not good at all would not recommend this place. food cold because it is next to door and service not good. cash is preferred if you pay by card they get very rude and a little offensive,2
"overpriced at 14.30 plus 10% service chstge,  service is quite forceful, service charges according to your whole bill, will not go back. dessert was straight out of iceland, and not the country only the shop. if yiu want to break your teeth, please seek a dentist.",1
selection wasn't the biggest but what was there was really tasty. constantly bringing fresh food out. would highly recommend,4
very good price for a buffet in central london. friendly waiter who by the way can also speak spanish!,4
"extremely busy, very cramped rushed through your meal",3
good fast service all u can eat great to st and run before a show not the greatest food obviously but we still enjoyed what we had,4
"wow! set price buffet in soho! the food was incredible, and the service second to none ",5
might actually have been the best place we ate at the entire trip!,5
"a lot and testy, and friendly staf!",5
very nice.,5
great food and lovely staff,5
good food. okay staff. very cramped,4
"it's an eamayl. quite pricey for the quality, but it's competative for the area.",3
an okay place when you're hungry. it's neat too. i'll visit again,3
food could have been tastier and a larger selection of desserts would be nice. price of 11.95 per person not including drinks not the cheapest. staff very helpful and friendly,3
"children are 10 and under, any older charged adult price and 10% service charge",3
"the food was ok, very warm, average. staff were relaxed, even one of them eating the complimentary mints. very laid back atmosphere which was off putting, would i recommend, yes with the lads for a belly filler, no for couple on a nice evening meal!",3
not for lovers of food tasteless!! not again!,2
pretty nasty.,2
disappointed with quality of food and service. i would rather prefer to walk around than having a meal here next time.sorry guys.,1
nice food.,5
"nice surprise. food was tasty, vegetables fresh, not too much oil as expected. decent selection. i still don't understand why i have to pay table service in a buffet....",3
fab so full now,5
no buggy allowed inside.,1
"staff with a bad attitude, rude. never come back",1
friendly welcome from staff. very popular with lots of customers. great choice of buffet including salad.,4
well i've seen better. not good food.,3
not that good,2
"nice place, nice hot food, good variety. may have to share eating space with a stranger",3
"this has got to be the worst chinese ever. do not waste your money on such bad food, in a dirty and cramped environment like this one. the staff ignore you until it is time to pay the very extortionate price for such dire quality food, barely fit for cockroach grub.would have given it a -5 star if i could. stay away!! .",1
budget fixed price no frills all you can eat buffet. good value and friendly staff.,4
"quick staff, food is what you pay for! some dishes are very nice, others feel like they have been around for some time. however it's a buffet, that's what you get sometime. the chinese tea was nice, we had good portions of food for the money. seating was quite cramped directly next to the buffet, which was a bit uncomfortable.",4
staff friendly and great value,5
good chinese takeaway style food nothing of fine dining quality but good for a quick eat and good price drinks cost a bit more but that's to be expected,3
only cash and very bad behavior if you do not have pounds. i would never even go through it again.,1
"nice place, all you can eat for a great price",5
"waiters was rude, food was ok, but very overpriced for it's quality. better eat somwhere else.",1
very cheap and average.,3
"as soon as we sat down with our food, someone else was complaining about how cold the food was. the food was cold and we complained aswell only to be told it was due to the aircon and the door being open and they told us to dig deeper into the tray and the food might be warmer. no apology whatsoever. not even worth 1 star really.",1
average at best.  expensive for what you have on offer.,2
affordable chinese food. very friendly staff,3
"good food, 11 eat as much as you want",4
decent food at decent price,4
"the food was alright, it was a little more expensive than the other chinese buffets on the same road so they aren't very competitive.they had advertised being cash only but this was causing lots of issues by having a broken card machine.",3
"good service, excellent food",4
"very nice buffet here, judging by the look of the foods, this place is far better than other buffets",4
"overpriced, poor quality and they even charge a service fee (it's self service!) drinks overpriced, much better option nearby, i made a mistake with this place.",2
decent but it is a buffet,4
wasn't impressed to be honest prices weren't to bad. but thought some of the chicken dishes which is all they really have was stale and tough.,1
good food for a buffet,4
"value for money, nice staff.",3
great food,5
"terrible, didn't like any of it!",1
not bad for a busy central london buffet. good if you are real hungry and in a bit of a rush.,4
good food and price,5
"you get what you pay, not a huge selection but fine for lunch wouldnt do dinner",5
very nice place. had a lovely meal.,5
"not much variety. very over priced. the food was ok. for myself and my wife it cost 33.00 we each had buffet and one soft drink each. 10% service charge added. a very small restaurant so it wasn't very comfortable. toilets weren't very clean either. if i had seen the wc before eating, i wouldn't have eaten there to begin with.",2
"no thrills, all you can eat restaurant - with a sting in the tail. we received a nearly 10 surcharge, for ordering 3x colas. will we be going there again - no !",2
i am glad i ate here before reading some of the negative reviews. it is a no frills cheap eating house and is good value for money. our food was hot and tasty and the staff pleasant.,3
a nice place to eat if you want traditional taste for a low price.,4
excellent food and variety. normal price and polite staff.,5
good variety polite service,3
they only take card.,3
"food was cold, stale,tasteless,overcooked,reheated, wish i would of read the reviews before going as would never of gone how this place is still open is beyond me.",1
just horrible,1
lisle street,3
just bad,1
horrific,1
worse nightmare ever!!!!,1
food is terrible,1
never again !!!!!!,1
"not the best food in chinatown, of course, but for less than 11 per head for all-you-can-eat, the choice is pretty good, including large king prawns, chicken satay, and lots of other tasty options. cash only, though, so visit an atm first. mls",3
"all the food was as cold as the night king's heart, the service was as crumby as a gregg's sausage roll and the place was as filthy as a 40 a day smoker's lungs. but my tiger beer was just above room temperature, so it's got that going for it. ",1
terrible food,1
shitty food. there were still feathers on the chicken wings so i had to throw them away. and i felt that it was very overpriced. i would rather eat something more.. clean and delicious with the same price. also they charge you 10% service fee which i hadnt got any. ,1
the decor inside is pretty low quality. the food is bs - the a small selection and i ended up with food poisoning. they also add a 10% service charge even though all we said was two buffets please and please can we have the receipt,1
great value for money. lovely soft noodles and great selection,5
"food was cold and staff thought it was fine.  food was watered down, there was nothing inside the spring rolls.  it was horrible.",1
"food cold, over priced drinks which came out of a can with a 65p label on. would not recommend even if it was the last buffet on earth.",1
best eat as much as you like in london,5
"decent selection of food however they dont take card payment, table service fee for a buffet?? and no recipt!",2
"when i went it was really cute, the food was great, the staff were friendly (even tho there was a bit of a communication language mishap with one of them, bless). i'd definitely go again, its good value for money but i think i have a bit of a crush on one of the workers so you can just ignore this review...",4
"food is cold and inedible, the staff are rude. no service with a smile. price was too high for what it was. i would not even recommend it for prison convicts.",1
"good treatment, but very bad quality! all the fried dishes weren't crunchy, all soft and very bad texture.very plain flavoursnot to recomend",1
nice buffet for a 12 all you can eat. decent enough ,5
"disgusting, raw chicken. don't. just don't.",1
"service non-existingfood - dry, and not our taste.",1
"food decent, not a great choice as the price reflects..staff seen to be away with the fairys but i found them ok. one has to be direct and no small talk and don't use humour over their heads as they lack understanding. you can fill your boots with the food, so you should and enjoy ",3
stopped in here for the all you can eat take out box fill your self and go.so they didnt have a lot of choice just the basics but the food wasn't  bad for price,3
"food was all cold, there were flies, and it cost 18. tables, walls and floor all dirty. there was a bad smell coming from the counter area, we left after 1 plate of the buffet. ",1
"too expensive for what u get, food 2 interior 1 staff 2",2
"hair in food, quite pricey with no desserts included in the price although food was nice. one of the best time that we had whilst in london, just because it wasn't that great!",2
"one of the worst food i could possibly eat.cheap but bad.please do not eat here, is worst than being hungry all day.",1
was my worst buffet experience ever.,1
probably the worst chinese buffet i have been to. i should have read the reviews first but never mind im still alive 10 minutes after eating here.,1
"unedible, worst chinese, difficult to even call it food",1
good selection,4
not too much food to choose.... ,2
"staff was very  rude, service was poor, place is small, noisy i am never coming back",1
"despite the food being okay, staff were incredibly rude! i pointed this out as we paid expecting some kind of apology and the response was, ""so, you don't like it, don't come back!"" advice i'll certainly follow.. avoid!!!",1
can eat food as much as i want!,4
a bit expensive for what it is. not so much cooking to choose.,2
"umh,,,, i will never go here again......it's your choice but i don't recommend :(",1
is ok the food,3
one of the worst buffet type restaurants that we have encountered.,1
okay food. not bad at all but not amazing i'd say. ,3
"we had the buffet, a little expensive but a good selection of food",3
"hardly any selection, dishes not replenished . plastic cup and plate. the food we had was ok but bland and dried out. wouldn't go again ",1
well worth the money,5
"not a lot of choice, but what we had was tasty. ",4
it is what it is. cheap for china town and no queue when you're beyond starving (or just feel like it).,3
avoid like the plague! food was uncooked and cold! staff were also extremely rude and unhelpful. they actually accused our party of not having the monet to pay! how can anybody be expected to enjoy raw chicken! only go if you really want food poisoning ,1
nothing special. kids meals are over priced. average food. much better places nearby.,2
"10 for all you can eat, good variety in food and friendly staff",4
bad experience,1
best asian food buffet,4
"dreadful food , dreadful staff. enough said.",1
"bad food, bad service",1
terrible food and miserable staff. save your time and money!,1
"don't eat here, it's fowl",1
good place to eat and go.its not your usual.,3
friendly staff. tasty food ;) thank you!!,5
good enough variety and hot,3
"bland food, uninterested staff, poor selection, plastic cups...what more to say? don't go.",1
one of only a very few buffet restaurants around china town.,4
"sometimes the food is cold, not big choice of the dishes.",2
the food was very lackluster and flavourless.,1
food was cold,1
"i pop there yesterday...really disgusting! i saw something suspicious but i skipped of it, but is ok if you are starving a lot, you can survive at least once in your live....or maybe not, who knows, you guys can try to see what's up",1
good food but they stared at me after 3 hours,3
was okay but not lots of choice,3
"good cheap food and friendly staff, but limited choice and a service charge i wasn't aware of in advance. cash only.",3
"very good food, fresh and hot, the staff were very friendly and polite and very attentive. the chicken wings and the prawns were great. the deserts as well. good value for money. definitely will return.",5
i go quite a lot.,4
"terrible food, selection and service. don't waste your time or money.",1
for 11.95 it was awful. food was flavorless and the quality was just bad. what a waste of money. would not reconnect to anyone. to add insult they charge an additional 10% for service charge.,1
good all you can eat buffet,3
"good selection of tasty dishes, very good value for money, friendly and helpful staff.",3
"the food was ok but the ketchup was out of date and one of the toilets had a dirty puddle of water on the floor with 2 pieces of chicken floating around on it. drinks were way overpriced, you can get 500 ml's for 1 but they sell 330 ml's for 3.20.",1
"for 9.95 its pretty good. obviously its not upto the same standard as some of the more expensive restaurants, but the food was all hot on my visit and similar in standard to chinese take away type offerings. a decent selection considering its quite a small place.",4
foods are so so yet the staff were super duper rude. we required to change our hot water to cold water. we were just trying to ask them will it possible to change and didn't force them to change but they mad and treated us rude and don't even want to serve us the water. ,1
this is a very nice chinese restaurant. the flavour and price is amazing.,5
"was really looking forward to visiting china town with my boyfriend who's never been before, however, the food at this restaurant was absolutely awful. tasteless and bland, and had to spit some dishes out. the staff were rude and miserable. horrible horrible place. ",1
"poor quality more pricey than other surrounding chinese buffet, but food not tasty at all, few choices, lack of seasonings very disappointed, would not recommend most of all you should pay 10% service fee without any receipt given back",1
great food but no desserts nice relaxed atmosphere but could do with lick of paint,4
best chinese buffet i've been to. big. lots of choice. ,5
"great food, polite staff, good price.. everything you want in a small buffet restaurant.",4
nice meal,4
"buffet was ok, but won't be going again as rude and unhelpful staff, hugely overpriced drinks and no pricelist - one of us ended up having to get more cash whilst the other had to wait. it is 2017, get a card machine! ",1
"wow. a really down to earth place in chinatown. food tastes ok and dont look too hard, vinegary sharksfin or crab soup, hard to tell, but tasty. crispy chicken wings rule, with sweet sour sauce.",3
disgusting food. pls don't get in. worst meal ever. i almost throw up.,1
really bad taste and location. food barely hot when not cold. was the only thing affordable but nothing i can say tasty! go away... ,1
worst chinese food i have ever had in my life.,1
"despite other reviews the staff was very attentive to us, even when the place was almost full. but that's the only good thing i can say about this palce. the food was really bland and most of it was cold. not really worth the money at all. ",2
"buffet, good price, good selection. tasty food! ",5
"the food was ok, certainly better than some of the other all-you-can-eat buffets in chinatown. if you're very hungry, it's excellent value for money",2
unfriendly people. ignore them and you have a tasty meal for a unbeatable price.,4
the worst chinese a i never seen. the atention was horrible. the food are soo bad quality. and the toilets are revolting.,1
"ok, so it's not gourmet and the staff are not the most friendly or attentive, but the salt and chilli prawns alone are worth 5 stars! i had rude dreams about them for weeks after i ate them. the shell is so crispy and tasty that you can literally eat the whole thing without taking the shell off...man i want some now!!",5
service was average. wanted to get the bill but our server with preoccupied with picking at his acne with a tissue in the mirror. food was poor. was not impressed ,2
"extremely disappointing. not a wide choice of food on the buffet (no duck, no pancakes, no desserts). the food that was there was low quality (the rice was so overcooked it was mushy). the toilets were very unhygienic and the staff were not friendly. avoid!",1
"while the food is fine for a buffet, the service is absolutely terrible. the older man, possibly the owner, is incredibly rude and has no customer service skills whatsoever. avoid.",1
basic setting - great food with a wide selection buffett,5
"dr ming is really nice and patient. she cured my acne after 4 months, which has bothered me for for 9 years! will definitely recommend her to my friends and colleagues!",5
confusing time. if it was my first massage ever ill probably have a phobia by now. masseuse practiced with dirty hands and used baby oil from sainsburys. i had to tell her to not to talk on facetime while massaging. im still in pain... mentally and physically,1
the acupuncture is really good! bad are the herbs (i took huo xiang herbs) .. they make me feel more sick after making a tea and they cost me 15 pound ... i thought they must be good stuff but dont take those cos they are not clean !,2
"as i know, hong ning clinic is the earliest chinese medical center. dr. luo is a skin expert.  i have indroduced many patients to see her and everyone has got good results. thanks to dr. luo. the staff in this clinic are also kind and helpful, always giving detailed consultation and nice treatment. will definitely recommend!",5
worst customer service ever received in london by manager dimitris. he spoke down to us and walked away as we were talking to him. he really let the place down.,1
"great place, amazing cocktails and music",5
"excellent food, ambience, service and music. can't fault anything.",5
"beautiful restaurant. my food was tasty, although i really didn't need 2 courses for brunch so wish the restaurant would offer a one course option! the service was friendly, albeit very slow.",3
host is so rude,1
good food and good service. noce place and well avhieved fusion of different dishes. wine list could be improved in terms of quality vs price.,4
amazing ambiance and very nice music ,5
bloody lovely food - amazing lamb chops.,5
the staff were quite rude and the food is overpriced. i do not recommend.,1
the worst restaurant in london..the stuff was rude..the food wasn't something special..and the prices were so high for no reason..,1
"great food, quick, friendly service",5
very cool atmosphere and great food.,5
great food and great service. the bar was full of people who thought they were film stars and do this must be the trendy place to go to at the moment.,4
very cool. loved the upstairs seating. nice place for a drink and food. keen to head back,5
"i would really recommend the restaurant to change its security guard. highly recommend it, bad manners and bad attitude. thinks hes the shah of iran.",1
"good food. not mind blowing, hence you do feel like you question why the lamb is 29. but the service is excellent, and the surroundings are great. but one thing which is amazing is the yellow tail cerviche. amazing blend of lime and chilli really adds to the flavour.",4
"a must place to be in london, amazing music and atmosphere!!",5
excellent food and service! i highly recommend the crab starter,5
prices are up there but food and drinks surprisingly back it up. calamari and sauce are on another level. fish and meats cooked perfectly. service was actually great. atmosphere certainly is snooty here and can probably make some people uncomfortable so place wont be for everyone,4
"lovely, cool, chic setting to have drinks, bite and catch up with the friends, or hold a gathering / party.",5
"nice and tasty food , trendy place. a bit on expensive side, food could be more original and service more organised.",4
"the dj girl was killing it, great vibe, good cocktails, hot bartender, my new fav spot now",5
cool trendy place with a hint of turkish. try the lokum cocktail,5
great food and wine,5
the bar upstairs is amazing! great vibe and amazing djs,5
"overrated,  way overpriced for what it is, mediocre food, appalling service, good interior (the only good thing about this place).",1
best place to be london,5
loved it.,5
"great vibe, the food is excellent and you can enjoy cocktail drinks on the second floor.",5
the food was quite a disappointment. and it was raining that night and the water was dripping right on to our table.,3
"good atmosphere, friendly staff and excellent service.",4
food was very very good but all came at once - they just need to space it out a little. we had literally all the starters (table for 8) and 2x fish of the day. bar upstairs is average though.,5
delicious food and great ambient! beautiful kitchen... worth it all!,5
great food! great service! great decor!,5
great atmosphere and amazing food! friendly and efficient service!!,5
"amazing food from their talented chef ilia patsio. perfect service in a vibrant atmosphere, beautifully decorated.top floor overlooking the restaurant has a chilling area with sofas, a bar and a dj where you can enjoy their great selection of drinks.",5
"good food, nice atmosphere but very expensive. i would expect better food with that prices.",2
oriental turkish food with nice music,5
the atmosphere and food was great. the budget is around 60 per person.,4
nice atmosphere,5
"excellent food, drinks, service and interior design! the atmosphere is magical.",5
so great,4
the venue has of the best designs and ambiances in london. the food is even better than the venue. hovarda is on the way to become a flagship restaurant of the aegean kitchen. crab borek is a must try with a bottle of raki...,5
food is delious champagne & cocktails they were lovely  staff were very professional & helpful i had a wonderful birthday celebcelebration tonight xx,5
"friendly staff, delicious food, upbeat vibe ...... whats up with the bouncer on the door of the restaraunt? very unwelcoming!",4
"i love this place. lovely food, great ambience",5
excellent bar upstairs. on thursday's the bar is a scene with good looking londoners while a dj spins tulum house that tends to be boring after 10 mins.,4
the best greek and turkish restaurant in london,5
i love the vibe and the music!!,4
"avoid this place!!!!! this restaurant can be summarized in two words : zero professionalism. service level is the worst seen in london among trendy restaurants. food is disgusting. waiters are not waiters, manager is not a manager. chef is not a chef. dont waste ur time and money. this place will never make it and last.",1
whatever.,1
"one of the rare places in london, where you can buy alsohol after 1 a.m)",5
posh in the bad waygood sound system and that's it,1
really cool bar in a bustling part of town. the staff were great and made great drinks. it's expensive but all the nice places in the area are.,5
nice place good staff but the food isn't wow.,4
cool hidden gem in soho. it was a quiet night that still had a house dj.,4
"service is great, especially the hostesses. they were extremely friendly and accommodating although it was not the busiest night. the only reason it gets 4 stars is because the halloumi costs 16 which is outrageous. dj at 930 was such a great vibe.",4
"food ok, good ambience, busy at night. dont order the scallops, it costs 34 and you get 3 (yes 3) scallops. table service very average and relatively slow.",3
very nice atmosphere and interior. the food is good and the set menu portions were generous.the service is on the slower side though and the music is always too loud.,5
"i absolutely loved it. a quite posh bar close to soho, with excellent house music. if i wanted to impress a date, that's where i would go. up to 11 on it also had more women than men, which evened out. definitely recommend.",5
"very pleasant experience as always. delicious food with a curious twist. there is a new dj playing almost every day on the first floor. attentive, professional, friendly service. every visit is like seeing some good friends.",5
average brunch. overcooked steak. forgot our order (even though the place was empty). i had a great first experience there. but this one really took the bar down,2
drinks are super good and not pricey which is hard to find in a venue of that standard,4
"it is one of those places where you queu for a long time even though it is not full inside and there are lots of people leaving the place.. of course if you have the right posh look or know the right person, your experience might be different. i never made it inside and will never even try it again..",1
all staff very friendly the security is very very helpful and very very good person the lamb choops is very good the greek salad has too much tomatoes,5
"beautifully decorated restaurant. apart from the salty squid starter, the food was delicious with goo service.",5
"a truly fantastic experience! we received complimentary shots and a dessert for our anniversary! maxim was also super courteous and kind the whole night, he served us in such a great manner.  highly recommended.",5
nice atmosphere. music and dinner . great cocktails and selection of wines.,4
"delicious food,great staff always smiling and professional. music after dinner on the second floor, nice people and good vibes",5
great food and excellent service,4
great drinks and very nice staff. simone knows best about cocktails!,5
if only there was more space and more lighted-up areas,4
incredible mix  (renewed) mediterranean cuisine  art deco ambiente  and deep house,5
wonderful bar on 1st floor,4
"this is the kind of place where i feel so well! cuisine, atmosphere, service, design & furniture, the energy... maybe it was just that night but it was perfect.",5
"an unique  mixture of balkan and mediterranean taste. the food is delicious! you can try some typical turkish and greek dishes,  served like tapas and seasoned with fresh dressing,  combining the full flavour of terra mediterranea. recently they have launched a brunch menu, which includes  unlimited glasses of spicy bloody mary. cheers!",5
"superb bar in soho! great cocktails, music and food!",5
"nice ambience, great greek and general mediterranean cuisine, good service.",5
"great cocktails. atmosphere brilliant when the dj is on in the bar. the interior design is great but i may be biased as lazaro is one of my favourites :-) the food is flavoursome, has differed each time i've been and the staff are very knowledgeable about produce and how each dish is prepared. will return again x",5
"i came yesterday for my birthday! the staff were amazing!!!!!! super accomodating! super friendly and really made the night fun, easy and special :) loved it. really appreciate the flexibility and the attentive service! music and food all amazing. i recommend the rib eye and octupus!",5
"funky, swanky restaurant/lounge with a mediterranean kitchen and great cocktails. velvet rope policy for when the bar gets busy a bit abrasive borderline rude",4
really good and tasty food! nice place,5
"fantastic food. beyond fresh and very creative, yet at the same time traditional, dishes. service was also great. quick with cocktails and meze. our main fish was a monk fish fillet for three. excellently cooked. the waiter was also extremely attentive. will come back.",5
"great decor and ambiance, terrible service! waiting over 20 minutes to get a menu, another 20 minutes to order, then 40 minutes to get our drinks! such a pity as the drinks were nice and the vibe is great. after another 30 minutes to pay the bill i am pretty sure i won't return. hopefully the restaurant service downstairs is better.",2
the food was amazing and the staff were very attentive with the bottomless prosecco,5
"too many people , i was waiting 20 min for drunk friday night. good music",3
great food and vibe! not the best service,5
"pretty average but pretentious bar: just another place that would make you queue outside to make it more desirable (old school trick). the manager would say (actually did) ""we are not obliged to serve anyone"". very unfriendly and rude staff starting from the door.",1
"great vibe, great food!",5
all thanks to yannick who gave us the best moments for tonight incredible was my birthday.. we're comming back really soon ,5
bouncers are rude and rediculous,1
worst place to have fun and eat,1
great interior and the lamb sovlaki is top. good atmosphere over lunch although the right side of the restaurant may be noisy with sound echoing inside.,4
"despite the pretentious nature of the place and the extremely high price for drinks the food is absolutely excellent, some of the best i have had in a long time. the service is ok, although don't expect to be treated too well here. go here for good food but don't expect much else.",4
stylish place with fine food and drinks. dress code is quite formal. the bar upstairs has a dj and its a perfect place to have drinks before going clubbing etc. the only downside is that they dont serve food at the bar after 9pm.,4
"delicious food and drinks, worth the visit!",5
"a perfect cocktail bar with amazing djs . the atmosphere is great and the whole stuff are very friendly. they have a wide bar menu. the prices are affordable. also, the ground floor is great to taste aegean food. don't miss this place if you like house music.",5
the food is average especially given the area and the service leaves something to desired.  there are  many better places to spend a few hours or pounds.,3
interesting fusion of turkish and greek. loved it.,5
"the best service, food, and brunch in london. absolutely recommend 10/10 amazing!!",5
delicious food and friendly staff,4
nice vibes cozy venue!,4
amazing food.,5
a very happening and sophisticated place with reasonably priced drinks and lots of good looking people. a hotspot in london at the moment.,4
"great ambiance, superb dj",5
no one goes here anymore,1
"vibe, crowd and dj here were all on point. we stayed until the place closed and had a great time",5
"absolutely stunning place , great food and the music upstairs is amazing ! try different starters and go also for one of the mains ! great interior !",5
"the guy in the door asked us if the company  we were waiting for are men or women. my question was why???? my friend (girl) respond  men and when he heard that, he turned his head from the other side and he said with irony  look ""don't look at me, we are fully booked"". totally sexistic and rude behavior in london 2019.",1
great greek food with a fun atmosphere,5
"way overpriced for what it is. 250for 3 with a bottle of barbaresco. 3 starters. 2 mains and a salad. the 400% mark up on all the wine really got to us, as did the overload and obnoxious music. its a sunday night. calm the tunes down and let folk pour their own wine. avoid.",2
super cool bar and restaurant with good looking clientele and great cocktails. the bar upstairs was really happening on a thursday night with people dancing in front of the dj and the bar being packed until 1am in the morning! definitely a gem of a bar and restaurant in a part of london that can either be too touristy or cheesy.,4
"excellent venue, not something you expect in a busy part of chinatown. classy, up market spot for drinks and dinner.",5
nice spot to meet friends when all places are busy. not cheap,4

style over substance,3
delicious food and polite waiters,5
fantastic food and good music. the venue itself is a must-see,5
an overrated place with rubbish service and management imposing deadlines on customers to finish food and kicking them out.,1
ridiculously overpriced for luke warm food and weak cocktails. service is beyond average and not worth 13.5%. pretentious and vacuous crowd.,1

sophisticated place. loved the food and drinks.,5
horrible service & way too expensive.,1
"super yummy food and for the quality the prices are reasonable. food arrives quickly, staff is very friendly. music is very loud so it's you want a heart to heart that's not the place for it. it's suitable for fun night out. drinks are super good and not pricey which is hard to find in a venue of that standard. decor is cool.",5
"nice option for a night out in soho! loved the looks if it! be aware that it might get too crowded at times , but, hey, you are at the heart of london!",4
"delicious food with well put together flavours and quality ingredients. good value for the quality on the pre theatre menu, and the included cocktail was also excellent.",4
"great bar, good fun, ridiculously expensive. 45 pounds for 2 drinks",3
now that is a find. in the heart of central london a gem. loved it.,5
music is way too loud in this place to have a dinner,1
"very nice ambiance & music, professional service, quality and tasty food.",5
fine mediterranean with some wonderful sashimi like dishes and an awesome saganaki,5
decent food. expensive but fine for the location. nice idea on foods of the aegean sea.staff were very much not on the ball that night. not a great experience when hosting a manager from the us.will prob not recommend,3
such a great vibe. the staff were so lovely and very welcoming. the music was great and the drinks were great,5
"felt thoroughly ripped off. 65 for bottle of ordinary cloudy bay, 16 for gin and tonic. main course from theatre menu smaller than starter and then ""discretionary"" 13.5% tip. two stars for food served being flavourful and convenient location but expect tourist ripoff.  have had miles better pre dinner menus elsewhere.",2
very friendly service. the party i was with were being difficult and the staff handled everything amazingly well. great atmosphere and cool music.,4
fun place to go out thursday to saturday! good music and vibe,5
"i think you should make , (hovarda member club)...",5
great food and amazing staff,5
modern atmosphere and excellent food. highly recommended,5
"the food is okay, a bit pricey and few options. worth going for the fancy japanese toilet and nice decoration.",4
"had the most wonderful evening at ichibuns. my boyfriend and i were served by maria who was so thoughtful and went the extra mile to make our evening so special. by far the best waitress we have ever had. the food was also incredible, i would recommend the cheeseburger spring rolls  nothing will ever beat them",5
"pricy, good food, awesome atmosphere.",4
"food comes out quickly, staff are very nice. decent amount of options on the menu",5
great gfree option. very tasty,5
"famous ichibun burger, fries and ichibun beer.... well worth it",5
"little manu and not many options, but sushi is sooo good, so fresh. and is a lovely place with lots of japonse modern decoration around. plus toilet is futuristic hahaha",5
good food and efficient staff. a bit too fusion for me but it's a personal preference and they execute well.,4
"excellent service, delicious starter (mushroom gyoza), best noodles (veg udon) i've had in a long time. will definitely be back.",5
quick service good price  ,5
the vegetarian burger (kakiage i think is the name on the menu) is amazing here!,5
i've been to many restaurants in london. this is by far the best! my all time favourite place to eat! i crave the dynamite shrimps on a daily basis ,5
"i really suggest you this place if you are looking for an experience.staff is very nice, food is a combination between japanese and american (spring rolls off burger as example), and the music makes the perfect mix.",5
easy 4 stars for me. it was really nice. food was good and staff were all very friendly and helpful.,4
got kicked out early to make space for a 8 people booking. i guess if you're spending more you're more of a priority.,3
amazing food and a good vibe. definitely returning.,5
had a great meal here. the food was excellent and the staff are fantastic.,5
"good food, careful service, menu is a bit too limited and not as asian as the business name would suggest. central london prices.",4
"overpriced..not value for money at all.udon chicken.. 3 small pieces of chicken drowned in terryaki water...  service charge added automatically was expensive, although service was ok.",1
"expensive, food pretty ordinary.",2
perhaps it is for the pop culture but i enjoy the burger and cocktails.,5
"delicious food, limited menu , great place to go for a drink (albeit a bit pricey) but well worth it for a decent date , catch up or something a little different.",5
down stairs is nice and cosy,5
"different, more vege and vegan options needed",5
best burger in town.,5
not so special,3
great food great great playlist!,5
"the service is really good, but tge food is overpriced for what it is. the 'wagyu' beef was very poor",3
"tasty food, fresh,",5
excellent place for a fun night out and eating japanese food. decoration is very entertaining and the music was very good. food was excellent and everything we tried was very good.  should be very well recommended.,5
lower of the expectations...,3
timo hambrguer,5
really good shushi but not for hard core japanese lovers,4
great service and food,5
good food. friendly staff. nice decor.,3
great burgers. very 'gram'able location.,4
"trendy ambience, but calling this place a japanese restaurant is a bit of a stretch.also the prices are quite steep - asked us if we wanted water and charged us 4 for the bottle without warning us.not desperate to come back again.",3
very delicious burgers and cool vibe as well.we shared the spicy chicken burger and the normal beef burger. yum yum,4
"popped in for a late night light bite, turned out to be a good choice. wagyu niku udon was excellent. fun little atmosphere with friendly staff. recommended.",4
great diner feel to this place. some amazing dishes on the menu,4
food was nice but pricey. only 4 stars because we had to wait a long time for the main courses of sushi platter and a hot noodle.,4
this place is a gem!! the food is amazing... the location is instagram worthy for photos from the way the food is presented to perfection to the beautiful interior. the salmon burger was amazing!! if you love classic sushi and burgers with great flavour its a must visit! plus its open late too. will defo visit again!! and again!!,5
"we loved this place. don't go here for traditional japanese food. go here for a relaxed atmosphere, great music, lovely staff and deliciously interesting modern japanese food. the hot udon with karaage was super tasty and everyone loved the crunchy veggie burger. highly recommended if you want something different.",5
"great decor, tasty food but a limited menu. had a tasty burger but was slightly overdone. one kids option (a burger).",4
"we had a promotional offer so visited for the first time. enjoyed the food, atmosphere and service. we will certainly go back with friends.",5
i felt so hipster being here!  the staff was lovely and the food was delicious.  i absolutely loved the ceiling decorations!,5
"brilliant concept... sushi + burgers under the same roof. really nice place for a bite to eat. the chicken burger was a 10/10. definitely recommend for tasty food, friendly staff and great ambiance in soho.",5
"we were lucky to have lunch during the lunar festival. got a great view of the lions chasing out bad spirits from the first floor. for food, i recommend the chicken karaage, gyoza and the popcorn shrimp. portion sizes are good and the staff were really nice!",5
"amazing designed restaurant. the space downstairs, in particular, is stunning. very quirky  decor - feels very unique. quite a simple menu, nothing crazy exciting but all good quality - quick and tasty. great value considering the location and the restaurant's premium design.",4
"this place despite not actually being an authentic japanese restaurant, it was a great fusion place. the wagu meat was great and you really cant order wrong on the menu, it was a descent price too. there was an amazing dish that can only be described as a cheeseburger in a spring roll that was so innovative and creative.",5
"the food here is great, as are the cocktails. really good quality, the toilets are great too! the only downside is service was very slow. however staff very good and accommodated my surprise cake idea for the hen",5
"wonderful restaurant with a great ambiance and friendly staff. the cocktails are amazing and so are the burgers. if you get a chance, try to visit the lower level.",5
you would not suspect how cool is the inside. all the decoration looks like you are japan with traditional tables etc. loved the food but thought it was a bit pricey though. would definitely recommend!,4
really happy with the food and service! wow gluten free crispy chicken! amazing. thank you lizzieee for being so wonderful and clued up on my allergy,5
i repeated my visit many times. amazing vibes and friendly staff! you should try out the burger if you love asian food dont forget to order gyoza veggie!,5
"fast service, cool space. the food is fresh and flavorful. my only (small) nit was that the tempura chicken noodle dish was actually served as a soup. that didn't really work. noodles and chicken would have been much better if served ""dry"" style.",4
i cannot recommend this place enough! food is a treasure! every bite is scrumptious! service is excellent. greeted beautifully and polish girl waiter was a treat.....atmospheric too,5
"the food here is brilliant! came here with my partner last monday to enjoy a lovely meal. great music, great atmosphere and great staff! our waitress lizzie, was very enthusiastic and bubbly, made us laugh alot, and the food was delicious. overall great experience will definitely be back!",5
great japanese place. cozy and the staff is friendly. service is very good and the food is top notch. the wagyu burger was very tasty. would recommend this place if you want a quick bite. bare in mind you will need to book in advance during peak times,5
great food and friendly staff. the food is definitely the highlight of the place. the ambience is super cozy and full of quirky items from japanese pop culture. i can see myself becoming a regular there. service was fast and the team there was very courteous.,5
nice busy place. good menu. it can use more drinks selection.,4
great sushi. great design inside,5
"the food was beautiful. we sat downstairs this time, it was wonderfully decorated and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. definitely my new favourite.",5
i went to ichibuns because it was classified as one of the best restaurants in soho. indeed it did not disappoint. i would 100% recommend it to anyone that looking for a cool place to eat with great food! excellent customer service as well. i would suggest the mochi for dessert!,5
"great place for a quick bite. burger was recommended... medium, the star of the show. noodles with chicken was a safe option.",5
"great atmosphere, very trendy. food was great a nice mix. we were in a rush as i had a show to go to. the food came out very quickly.",5
"the food is a blend of burger and japanese food. you could argue that neither is as good as a pure burger or japanese restaurant, which is true, but it kind of works. the food is tasty, the atmosphere is trendy and the service is quick.",4
food great. music great. staff great. atmosphere great. must experience. highly recommended. will visit again.,5
it's a restaurant with really good atmosphere but the food was 3/5,4
miniburger/spring roll hybrid was delicious.,5
superrrrb fun place for lunch very nice food. also had dinner with friends the dj really made the place so live. must try their burger spring rolls and sushi so insannnne,5
"interesting, bit takky but fun atmosphere. nice drinks and ok food. the shrimp popcorn are very tasty",4

"great ambience,  nice sicely set up. burgers were delicious. good veg options too.",5
"by far the best burger ive ever eaten, such a cool atmosphere.",5
"good food, had an issue with our order but was quickly sorted out by management, was a nice touch.",4
so wonderful interieur and very delicious drinks and food. also expensive but worth it,5
really cool restaurant near china town. we had the wagu beef spring rolls and the burger both of which were fantastic. staff were helpful and friendly when we wanted to sit upstairs. well priced and would definitely go back!,5
loved the food and the design of the restaurant. downstairs there's a very cool pub isle.,5
"wrong order, expensive, small portions. very simple food. the menu is very short. when i told the waiter that my order was wrong, he told me that i was wrong and he was right. i won't come back. the place is flashy and looks like a nice one, but it's a travellers trap.",3
"such a coo place, interior design is fantastic, down to the lavatories. clean and well looked after. food was great and the service very friendly. great venue for business lunches or parties. will definitely come back, thanks to my friend patrick who reccomemded and showed me this gem in london's china town.",5
a tad pricey for the food. the small bits pretty good. the buns are not as exciting.,4
"food was amazing, atmosphere was so good and the staff were so friendly and always on the ball! don't have a single complain about this place. definitely go here for a great meal",5
"loved this place, they had a really good service and helped us to good sake. meal was really tasty and if i get back to london in the future id come here again and id recommended it to anyone who comes here.",5
"not worth your money. burger and bun were super greasy.  67 for two burgers, soup and two appies. i get this is london but the burger was pretty small. trying to be trendy but failing.  much better places to eat.",1
"japanese fancy place, cool music, great cool service and  tasty fusion japanese food. i do recommend at all.",5
"great food! the shrimp and chive gyoza were amazing. and the ume cocktail was a delight...even if i had them remove the egg white from the mix. on that note, they were happy to make substitutions, which is rare enough that i should mention it.",5
great restaurant in the heart of chinatown in london. good food and service.,4
great venue and decor.  food was just ok,2
very nice food.,5
"delicious. great atmosphere, delicious food. highly recommend the ichiburger. pricing very reasonable too considering it's central london.",5
yum... really liked this place. initial seating wasnt great but moved to upstairs which we enjoyed. crispy rice and spicy tuna roll was yum but had to ask for wasabi. cheeseburger roll was nice... different but nice,4
"the decor was the main reason i went, being a fan of showa era japanese things, the retro vibe made me excited. it was very nicely decorated. however, the food was... alright. my coke was flat, and i felt the ramen rather lacked vegetables and flavour.",3
the food was amazing but small portions for the price. great vibe and funky decor!,5
great food and vibe!,5
"it was a wonderful experience eating there. of course it wasn't cheap but what can you expect restaurant in the middle of china town?atmosphere - splendid!food - delicious!even though, my meal looked tiny, this filled my stomach.definitely recommended!",5
beautiful food in a trendy atmosphere,5
one of the best restaurant experiences i've had ever! worth a visit,5
"nice decor. great service and very helpful staff. unfortunately, the udon dishes were too salty.",3
"great food, good cocktails, friendly staff. prices are a bit spices but within reason. 10/10 would eat again.",5
the food was great and the desserts were delicious,5
cool interior and they have toto toilets in the bathroom.  food is average but a large range of dishes.,3
great asian food. friendly service. good cocktails. fantastic atmosphere and top-notch beats! ps: you must check out the bathroom!,5
"absolutely loved it!!! the sushi was the best i ever had, the cocktails too and their decor is lush, a great place to go would definitely recommend!",5
i gave it 4 stars because the service wasnt that great. i ordered my burger well done it was burnt from the outside and still pink inside. its expensive for the quantity and the quality. i dont think ill visit again.,3
so good. really cool inside,5
"great ramen, good sides, amazing burger. if you're going for the food you won't be disappointed. don't expect to sit and have a quiet dinner though there is loud music and a dark room for the dining area.",5
all four burgers well-done no where near medium rare,3
very nice place to eat a bit on the expensive side but worth the money. i recommend the udon:,5
"first time in this restaurant and we will come back! the burgers and the japanese beer were very good. the place is beautiful, colorful. the staff is really friendly.",5
good service. nice food a bit more complex and tasty very good sake very well balanced,4

"best japanese food. try the cheeseburger spring rolls, they are mazing.",5
lovely food. need more in menu!,4
"best sushi place in london, high quality rice and friendly staff, the upper floor is amazing too!",5
"something different! if you have the chance visit the basement 1, you will be surprise, good vibes! wonderful place and amazing staff! thanks specially to josh who made our visit even better!",5
"very mediocre food. on top of that, they have a ridiculous security rule that you cannot pay with apple pay over 30!!!",1
it had such lovely decor! if you're a fan of anime/manga or japanese culture this is the place for you. the menu is simple but the food is very tasty and hot. the food and drinks came so quickly after we ordered so amazing service. the toilet was very lovely too. overall great experience. i shall be back!,5
"the food was very delicious specially nikoudon , cozy place with great service",5
love the decor! and even the toilets are japanese! would definitely recommend here to eat. dynamite shrimp and prawn tempura maki we're delicious,5
amazing burgers and ramen. the decor is to die for also. loved it all. great cocktails too. a must try. unique!,5
loved this place in the heart of china town. food was great and so was the service from a friendly bunch of staff. there was sixteen of us and despite such a large group the meals were all perfect. highly recommend a visit.,5
the foods excellent and the place gives a japanese vibe,5
"love this place! food amazing, atmosphere amazing! music playing is great. decor is fun. drinks are generous!",5
"veggie burger and chicken karage burger really good. hearty and delicious. prawn gyoza was too salty, but tasted good. service was fast and friendly.interior is very nice, with a decent amount of seating. toilet is so cool! japanese style electronic one.",5
"table hosst or whoever this guy is... killed my experience, customer service is bit like in kfc.. food and interior amazing x",3
"great beef wagu ramen, friendly and good service...!",5
"would give 0 stars if i could. expensive (50+) , and i got pretty bad gastroenteritis from eating their gross tasting noodles, which they clearly must have cooked a while ago, set aside and then warmed back up.",1
"great food, fun environment, friendly waiters, a must go place",5
yummy food. good service,4
"very good udon noodles, great interior and friendly staff",5
"love love love this place. great atmosphere and music downstairs, much more chill upstairs but with that street food vibe. must try the spicy tuna roll and the wagyu ramen!",5
great food but a bit pricey,4
"ichibuns is one of those rare places in london - simultaneously reasonably priced, serves food til late, and has great decor.  perfect for a 1 am feast when you don't want to go home but don't fancy any more drinks.  very tasty too.",5
"best udon ive had in london so far. i highly recommend the yasai tempura, its amazing ",5
amazing gyozas ever bless up kingbetter than in japan,5
super nice food with polite stuff,5
tasty ramen & nice atmosphere,5
"overpriced and not worth it. go to any other resteraunt around here. avoid at any cost. seriously, go to the bakery accross the street and a few doors down. get yourself 2 green tea ice creams in a fish shaped cone. you will be happier and only spend a few pounds.",2
fantastic design and delicious food!!!,5
"japanese hipster vibe cant cover for the average food, gyoza decent but the chips smelt awful and were clearly fried in very very old oil which made them taste off.",1
expensive but totally worth it. food and decor are amazing,5
slow service on a weekday and the wait was not worth it for some pretty bland udon noodles.,2
sushi was decent but the fried chicken karaage burger and ichibun (wagyu) beef burgers were amazing! it is a must try!,4
"great food, nice atmosphere and very polite staff!",5
"the restaurant is awsome, service is super friendly and i recomand the ichibun burger, its probably the best burger i have ever tasted.",5
fun place to eat out with the family,5
"kind staff, tasty food, awesome mochi! it is not really cheap, neither expensive, you usually dont pay more than 20, but it really is worth it.",5
"def not up to basic udon standards. ordered veg tempura udon, the noodles were so old and overcooked that they had no springy texture but mush like porridge. it didnt help the fact that the tempura were too greasy like they were cooked from old oil. would never pay 12 quid for that kind of udon again",2
"love the details of this place. retro japanese inspired vibes. their best orders are sushi rolls, burger and burger spring roll.",4
"weird door guy had us waiting outside with an half empty restaurant. food was ok, at best. looks cool though.",2
"the food was alright, im just not sure how i feel about the patty in the cheeseburger harumaki, or dipping it in the cheese sauce.",4
food was great but felt a bit rushed to finish,5
great japanese restaurant. lovely interior and amazing staff. the burger was surprisingly good and prawn tempura maki was lovely too. definitely go back again to try  new dishes,5
the starter was lovely. nice atmosphere.,4
great service. great food. great drinks. all at reasonable prices. would go again in a heartbeat.,5
"good quality but poor menu choice (visited at lunch time, not sure if there is another menu at night)",4
one of the best burgers i've eaten in my life. the music and ambiance are great for and intimate first date or to hang out with some friends before going to the club. the staff is very nice and helpful.,5
best ramen ive ever had!,5
"good and fast service, nice atmosphere.",5
"delicious gyoza and yummy veggie burger ! nice selection of beer, although it'd be great if asahi was on tap",5
"great surprise ! the atmosphere was great , the food was modern , fresh and with a twist ! definitely recommend!",5
"we got seated very quickly and enjoyed nice service. however, the quality of the food was rather average - there are many more places in the area with much better and more authentic food.",3
good food quick service reasonable prices,5
tourists trap. very overprice with very small and tiny portion and quantity of sushi for the price of a 45 pound menu. will never ever go there again.,1
"great atmosphere, music fun but not too loud, food absolutely lush! great service too.",5
"great food, great staff",5
overrated. food was very average. good atmosphere,2
great restaurant and interesting food. we ordered lots of starters which were delicious. the main dish noodles were excellent too though the portion size could have been bigger.,3
"enchanting interior, energized staff, elegant dishes, a refreshing addition to the soho scene. i hope they're sticking around for the long run to spread the word of authentic sushi done right.",5
very obliging staff and great food. lovely atmospheric place. will visit again when in town.,5
"great food, great service, masimo really sold it to us, great guy.",5
this is one of my choice for dinner & drinks with friends in soho! good vibes and love the combo sushi + meat buns!,4
doorman was really rude. didn't greet us nice. lets you wait outside. say they have a table ready. yiu come inside. they ask everything all over again. food was mhoa. noodles didn't have a lot of tast. burger rolls were tasty!,2
"best restaurant in london so far, i recommend their chicken karaage burger",5
"the biggest mistake you'll ever make is ordering their burgers anything more than medium, but i'm a midrare guy myselftheir sushi is great, one of their rolls aren't even on the menu, called the dragon roll, best one there in my opinion. i haven't had the noodles but apparently theyre really good i've heard",4
"wow, just wow. friendly service, great internals, the burgers are from another planet. there's some kind of japanese udon meets american diner thing going and it's done perfectly. definitely one to seek out if you're a burger connoisseur.",5
"great atmosphere, great food, great for groups.",5
"food on point, ambience lively! quite a few fried options- which suits me well!",5
amazing food! atmosphere is good... just a bit loud and you can't have dinner co creations really. the decorations however were astounding. definitely would recommend.,5
"very nice found, food very tasty, good quality for reasonable price. polite and friendly service and awesome design in restaurant you can  feel japanese atmosphere.  we definitely comes back for more . totally recommend thank you",5
"food and drink is great, but music is too loud. its like being in a night club - not really what id call a dining experience. cant hear any one else at the table with you.",3
great japanese fusion food,4
"the food was fresh, tasted great & served quickly. portions could have been bigger.",3
had a wonderful time here. delicious food and friendly helpful staff. would definitely recommend.,5
must get the springroll cheeseburger,5
"it was for the company's christmas party, the atmosphere was great. we had finger food which was delicious but also enough to get full, and the cocktails were very refreshing. a big thank you to the ladies in service they were very attentive and always with a smile on their faces. ichiban team you smashed it thank you!!!",5
"nice venue with retro decor and friendly staff. food appeared very saturated with fat (chicken bun). we also got charged twice for the desserts which were included in the kids meal offer, luckily we noticed it!",2
"terribile service upstairs except the lovely black girl at the door. she was amazing. food was ok. too expensive, though. location and ambience was beautiful.",2
my fave restaurant by far!!!! love the yuzu cocktail and literally every appetizer is to die for.,5
"great food, inexpensive as for london",5
"original and very good, although kind of overpriced (but nothing unexpected considering the area). do not miss a trip to the loo (they're japanese-style toilets)!",4
"really beautiful environment! the food was all delicious and reasonably priced. the sushi rolls are really small and you might need two orders, but they are wonderful!",5
great burger. really delicious,5
absolutely love this funky restaurant! perfect meal with the wife and their milkshakes are awesome!!,5
vegetarian udons are amazing.would recommend this place !,5
went with friends and thoroughly enjoyed it. the atmosphere and decorations are very nice. well presented food which tasted pretty good. i would recommend it.,4
"great service, nice food.",4
the food is great however the staff aren't treated good enough with only having a short break after 10 hour shifts! i think management really need to fix up and consider their employees more as this is against the law. they get less than half an hour breaks for long shifts and this is unfair.,1
great spot in soho. nice vibe and authentic menu,4
"good sushi , loved the cocktails! a bit pricey due the location im guessing.",4
well greeted by a friendly staff. food and drinks are outstanding.,5
menu was okay..not spoilt for choice. a bit pricey too.,3
"i discovered this place few days ago and i have to go again because i'm obsessed with edamame!!! food is good , i will be back for trying sushi.",5
"the place has a unique design, great food, great atmosphere and very good service!",5
"had a fantastic experience at ichibuns with lizzie as our waitress. she was wonderful and made the evening even more special. lovely restaurant, great food and fantastic service. thank you lizzie!",5
"loved this place! the restraurant itself was soo well designed and fashionable. and cocktails and the food was excellent, but the sushi took everything. it was mind-blowingly delicious!! one of the best restrauants i've ever been one of the highlights of my trip in london!",5
great food great atmosphere and the service is great. always pop in when i get the chance.,5
sooooo delicious. haven't had such good ramen in awhile. and i had the vegetarian option - broth was still very hearty. tried one of the crispy rice dishes - yum! would make it a point to go back.,5
"i took friends there with two young kids. great atmosphere, fun decor to distract the kids while the waiter was ignoring us most of the time. food was very good, excellent burgers and fries. i recommend to sit upstairs.",3
"honestly one of the best restaurants ive been too. service was amazing, food came out quickly. the vibe was great, such good music too! food was absolutely delicious and so reasonably priced, i couldnt fault a single thing. i recommend booking a table as in the evenings there can be queues.  10/10 would go again!",5

the ichibun burger is ichibomb! the cheese/sauce was amazing though some might find it quite oily. 13.5 for burger and fries. good atmosphere and decent staff. would recommend the kirin beer!,4

the flavour of the food was good and fresh orange juice was perfect. the service however was extremely poor. the dishes for each course were not served together and the order was not taken correctly. the standards here have dropped considerably. won't be going back.,2
"ive been to this place many times in the past, its always been quite good, but food in my recent visit was extraordinary. everything was ",5
"i've eaten here four or five times now, one of the best places for dim sum in china town. the staff are always friendly and attentive, food always tastes good. i especially love the soft shell crab! i would thoroughly recommend this place. ",5
green beans too salty and peaking duck was a bit dry otherwise was ok but probably wouldn't specifically come back.,3
nice event and food,4

this is the yum cha place to go to in chinatown. consistently delicious food and high quality,5

good dim sum but not much if a selection of bigger dishes,4
"lovely service. friendly staff, good place to take oriental style pictures, and the food is really really tasty. i recommend",5

"usually good but today was very poor - waited for an hour and got chewy, bad food. very disappointed.",2
really good food at a very reasonable price. service was attentive and quick though we had to ask for soy a few times before it came to the table. regardless of that little mishap i will definitely go again.,5

"reasonable chinese food, but service is somewhat rude. its plenty big enough for many people though, so you are safe to get a table.",3

"good dimsum, a little pricey",5
"no dim sum available, rude staff",1
this is my go to place in london for dim sum. served until about 4 ish.  after then they just offer a few basic dim sums.   the regular chinese food is ok but nothing super special. also great value.,4
"great food, good restaurant and the entrance is set back with a bridge and indoor pond with some huge koi carp. i've been coming to this restaurant for several years and i've never been disappointed yet. it's the only chinatown restaurant i will use now because out of the others i've been to, this one is miles ahead.",5
"really bad and bland food. i ordered a beef dish with cantonese sauce and what i got was literally pieces of beef in ketchup.also ordered a rice and chicken dish, the rice was ok but the chicken was the blandest thing i have ever tasted, just straight up water boiled peices of chicken, no seasoning no flavour, nothing.",1

the best for dim sum in china town. a little pricey but worth it.,4
"great food,service and atmosphere.",5

"popular restaurant ideal for groups.serving the usual favourites, perfect for feasts!",4
"my favourite chinese in chinatown for the quality of food. the portion sizes are smaller than usual and prices higher than usual, but both are acceptable for the quality of food. the service is ok for chinatown but would be considered poor for the price in any other cuisine.",4
chaotic service. mediocre food. stuff turns up in person and on your bill you didnt order. ok wine list,2
"that was the softest most delicious roasted duck i've ever tasted, i take off my hat for this extravagantly delightfull meal! ",5
great here. wide range of chinese food. very nice cosy entrance with bridge over fish filled pond. cost atmosphere inside,4
"a good place in chinatown for reasonably priced good food. i have had dim sum as well as dinner here numerous times and it has never disappointed. the small bridge and fish pond at the entrance also lifts the overall feel of the place, setting it apart from some of the other dingy and sticky chinese restaurants around.",4
the food is really good. not cheap but worth the money you pay. service needs polishing but all in all a good restaurant. ,4
"the best chinese food that i have tasted in london's chinatown. the food is not only good, the environment is comfortable and the service is excellent.  highly recommended.  listed in michelin guide 2017",5

food superb,5

"nice food, 2nd visit and very fast, authentic and dim sum is yummy too",4
the food was pretty average but the service was great and staff was very friendly,4
"decent place for dim sum. is deceivingly small from the outside, but once you enter there're three floors of restaurant space which means even very large groups can be catered for. slightly upscale and quite fashionable decor compared to some of the other chinatown restaurants.",4
always been there with at least three people or groups. old style food and generally tasty. just a slightly salty and greasy. others are ok.,3
"terrible experiencerude staff, found myself having a stand up argument with a waitress during dinner! main course served before starter and then told it was our fault!dishes extremely small for the price wont be returning",1

"dim sum has lost its tradition here. you just cannot have fusion dim sum - it does not work. also you need to sort out the waitering service...which was lousy. and buy your chinese tea leaves from a new supplier, the po-er tea was substandard. not on my recommended list of good eats in soho this year.",2
one of the best places for dim sum. its busy but that just means its good,5
hen party.. lovely food..man who waited on our table was very friendly and helpful.. will go again..take the train next time..had to drive .. parking no no.restaurant had parking..but at 8.an hour,4

dont bother. over priced greasy tasteless food. might want to change the oil occasionally! grumpy service. definitely go somewhere else. very disappointed,1
another great dim sum experience. never disappointed at the imperial,5
"great place, nice interior, lovely food and kind staff!",5
pretty good chinese food. very pricey for what it is though.,3
one of the few chinese restaurants in chinatown which isn't a open-and-scam scheme. it's as good as four seasons. that alone is a 4* rating.the extra * is from not immediately assuming i'm chinese,5
nothing to complain about the food. but service was worst ever i had. beware of the woman with short hair.,1
best restaurant in chinatown. i'm a huge fan of dim sum there. highly recommended.,5
"it was definitely better 10 years ago. even if the chicken soup is not very tasty, all other dishes were very good. service a bit chaotic but i guess we will still come back!",3

average. no effort made to keep you happy,3
taste asian food great service!,5
"great food, authentic location",5
"there are lots of chinese restaurants in this area, but i chose this one because a friend recommended it. the service was pretty average, the steamed prawn dumplings were good, but the wanton soup was less than great. im sure there are much better chinese places on this strip. give this one a miss...",3
amazing food and amazing service,4
"atmosphere is excellent. food is generally good. the peking duck was disappointing, and the oolong tea was less than stellar. very good otherwise. the szechuan prawn is specially good.",4
"really lovely experience, have to walk over a little bridge with you carp in to get into the restaurant. service is good and the food is lovely. quite expensive though. there were 2 of us and we ordered 3 mains and 2 sides with an alcohol drink each costing just shy of 65",5
the best dim sum place in london.,5
good food at good price. recommended.,4
food was great as always. really good place and have done work events here as well. staff are great and look after you. highly recommend.,5
it's ok. nice atmosphere,4
we have been to the restaurant many times and generally the food is ok and i would gice it a three star. but the last visit was very disappointing. food came very late and was very chewy. they told us kitchen is busy because of a wedding - ideally should have told us before we sat down !,2
came for dinner. location is central in china town and convenient for leicester square. the food was only average and chicken kung po was quite tough. crispy duck pancakes were okay. service was lack lustre at best.,3
the dim sum were fantastic !,4

pricey but the food and service was spot on. definitely reccomend and would go again!,5
a reliable west end chinese restaurant. food good. i like the water feature at the entrance.,4
"elitist establishment with terrible service. when we dine as large groups, we are treated slightly better but the establishment is overpriced and motivated solely by making money. we won't be going back.",1
"food was good but service was very, very poor.  rude staff, no complimentary prawn crackers (when asked, the waiter got snippy), used plates not cleared away.  would not recommend.",2
"good food,generous portions,careful before ordering,wasted a lot ,was a bit upset about that",5
"as ever, good dim sum",4
"if you would like to experience one of the worst comustomer service experience ever, please make sure you good to this restaurant, where the staff will laugh at your face for the amount of food you would like to order and the sequence of it.",1
not great. have eaten here at least once a year over many years. felt it was off the pace. better restaurants on the main street.,1
"excellent atmosphere, great food and the service was good too.",4
lovely place for food and karaoke. vegan options available!,5
"great place to enjoy good, authentic dim sum at lunchtime. the service is fast and the food is very reasonably priced. however i find their evening menu to be somewhat run of the mill and nowhere near as good as dim sum. ",3
"incredibly rude staff- forced to order as soon as we sat, were pressured to finish quickly. whole experience was really stressful- like a boot camp meets a restaurant. treated like a fast food in and out, but they are happy to charge higher restaurant prices. food was also average so there's plenty of better choices in the area.",1
unfortunately both dishes were very bland and not like chinese food at all.,1
"was there for a birthday party. poor service and food quality for 37 per person. the food was the quality if a cheap hamburger st fast-food restaurant. the only exception was the private dining room, which was a nice size for 60 people and tables covered in acceptable linens.",2
"bad food, bad service, use to be good but alas no more",1
a large menu with a good variety of dishes and they also offer a dim sum menu. portions are quite large so don't order too much.,4

"excellent place. dim sum is great, good service and reasonably priced",5
good food...nice restaurant..poor service....i had to get up and ask for drinks...second beer never came.  my sizzling beef fried with onions came in a bowl and was cold.,1
"very good food (especially the dumplings) at reasonable prices. i was surprised how big it was inside. the entrance is definitely a lot nicer and raised my expectations for the interior. however, it's very basic inside. it's clean and i don't have anything negative to say about it but don't expect a fancy interior.",4
various dim sum dishes for lunch. recommend crispy prawn dimsum. also hong kong style duck is very tasty.,4
"the service was average, more hurried. the food quantity was good and the pricing was just about ok, unless you went for their set menu... in which case it was good! the only reason i am rating them 3 instead of 4 is because of their drinks menu... priced way over ",3
excellent food,5
"the 5 stars are purely for the dim sum, best in london in my experience. love the atmosphere, staff could be friendlier.",5
"although the food we finally got was good, apart that is for the crab meat and sweet corn soup...we were not able to have the food we had originally ordered as the kitchen had run out...a tad sloppy at 6.30pm  on a saturday...so no pork...?",3
"great food and great price for dim sum during lunch periods. staff not fluent with english, but as long as you know what you want it's fine!",5
"no frills place to grab dumplings. you wouldnt sit down and have a lengthy meal here but its great to just grab a quick, cheap meal.",4
honestly? skip it... the dumplings are good but the skin is incredibly thick! order the wonton noodle soup and youll get instant noodles... seriously? instant noodles in a restaurant?! i could do better at home!,2
"really tasty dumplings, i recommend bejing dumplings, fried squid is also really good. the food is usually served really fast and the prices are affordable.",5
"sadly food is really cheap, but prices high. dumplings are very poor, vegitarian ones tasteless. noodles bland.really pooravoid",1
"enjoyed visit here, though crowded inside as weather very cold that day. excellent home made soup, bread and cake, simple food, all at reasonable london prices with view of the serpentine. took some time to get a table, the only downside. in the summer time i . don't think this would be a problem.",4
some good food,4
nice place for dumplings.,4
i liked beijing dumplings.,4
"it's so good for the dumpling n their wonton soup, wishing u be success",4
"best value for money in bahrain. the chef is out of this world.order shish tawook, bahraini tekka . grills in general are good. forget about there sweat .. unless you order a freshly prepared konafa",5

"cheap and cheerful dumplings, boss old lady service",5
"loved the drinks, the sushi was ok",3
"nice little plate of fried dumplings for 6-7. no alcohol, cash only.",4
excellent coffeealways crowed though. victim of its own sucess,3

"tasty and fresly made dumplings, it is tiny space, not expensive and worth visiting for beijing dumplings.",5
"if you really like chinese food, then this place is for you. classic and delicious dishes with wonderful service. jen's is the top of my list for places to dine in leicester square.",5
dumpling very nice and made infront of us,3
"after the hype of the dumplings i expected them to be really good, but the skin was too thick and stoggy. we ordered eat in and they claimed we said take away and tried to kick us out of the restaurant for eating it in. also they have upped their prices from 5 pound for 8 to 6pound for 7.disappointed for handmade dumplings...",2
absolutely rubbish dumplings for the price you pay. rude staff - said that i asked for take out when i clearly didnt. definitely do not recommend.,1
its amazing and highly recommended to everyone who needs a break,5
not the best dampling i've eaten but very affordable price. and the service could be much better,3
"there's no words to describe how tasty the dumplings are in this place. they'll be prepared by hand right in front of you! i love how fast they'll serve you and i always enjoy their selection of non alcoholic drinks. not many seats unfortunately, and remember, this is a cash only restaurant",4
absolutey loved it! fresh and delicios dumplings!,4

very nice staff. very nice food. small place.,5
good customer service and perfect tea!!,4
"if you don't mind sharing a table and the lack of basic customer service you'll love this place.  the dumplings are awesome and the ribs are epic.  enjoy!  ps you'll also probably have to queue, you can't reserve.",5
"ive walked past this little eatery so often and always wanted to step in for a taste, but today i did and the dumplings are gorgeous, the pakchoi is savoury, the satay beef meatballs with noodles are delicious, and the shredded pork with pickled veg soup is yum yum!",5
very nice reasonable chinese food,5
nice,4
ginger tea very good..belly pork delicious.. otherwise a bit mediocre,3
the dumplings were very tasty and authentic. my friend's hot and spicy pork noodles weren't actually spicy unfortunately. the iced milk tea was good as well. pricing is 5 for 7 dumplings (not too bad for london). ,4
just walked past i'm afraid,3
best dumplings,5
food good but not stunning,3
staff are friendly but don't expect a smiley face to great you.the foos however is next level.you don't expect the flavors to burst in your mouth when you sit in the cafe but he foods amazing.the place does need to have a refurb as its a bit tatty,4
my go to place for dumplings - order one fried and one steamed. they are so good.,5
"cool, traditional, not expansive, good fresh food, downtown london",4
"freshly made dumplings. no fuss authentic chinese food. love their dumplings and fish ball soup. must try.  bring cash though, they don't take card payments",5
"good dumplings (from what i've heard, don't order anything else). but then they ask if you want some greens (not on the menu). i said yes and then the bill came that a side of broccoli was 7. i challenged the waitress who said that was the price, but can't help feeling this must be a way to gouge the unsuspecting.",2
"worst chinese food i've ever had... we had quite a few dishes including the dumplings, the rice dish with bbq pork and duck. all the dishes we had were so bad... very poor quality.. however, service is fast but not worth it to go there... will never go back..",1
"appalling customer service. walked in and didn't even bother to greet or sit us down. food was horrible too we ordered jajeangmein and a rice with pork belly and roast duck, it was incredibly salty and hardly any meat",1
"had their dumplings both fried and steamed. the dumplings are well made and delicious. however, the portions leave something to be desired and i definitely left hungry. perhaps not the worst for the price range but i'd recommend ordering 2 or even 3 portions if you actually want to get full.",3
"it was not my first time here but now never again! poor food, 50 cents noodles sold for 10 pounds, half a liter of water 3 pounds !! thieves26/12/18",1
"try the lemon chicken, it is out of this world.",5
"bad service, expensive food. dont recommend this restaurant.",1
excellent service and food,5
"good dumplings made in house in front of you , very authentic, interesting expirience and fantastic value for money",4
great place for eats.,5
"poor service, below average food for the area. perhaps worthy if it was half the price, but you're so much better off going somewhere else nearby. like anywhere else.",2
"not allot of chooses, cash only is an inconvenience.",3
"i finally had a taste of home in that restaurant. it's all affordable, delicious, and they'll find you a seat anywhere. don't forget to bring cash, or they'll turn you away.",5
good cheap chinese food,3
"great food, interesting menu system and friendly staff. should be able to pay by card though.",4
"nice food but my hubby had a very bad tummy after his, was ill for 2 days, not sure if there was a spice etc that didn't agree with him?",4
"i ordered a takeaway but i was told to wait outside for nearly half an hour in the cold (winter time). although i understand they are very busy at sorting out the orders, the dumplings i got at the end was undercooked. wish it would turn out better next time as i saw they make great dumplings.",1
ribs here are a joke. small portion and filled with bone. tea tastes like water.,1
"i liked the vegetarian dumplings, but my family wasn't impressed by their food. over priced and not obvious that it's cash only.",2
just have a quick noodle is good. taste are fine.,3
our food felt like it was microwaved. pretty sure this place doesn't have a stove. don't get fooled by the dumpling making in the window,2
hand made dumplings were decent. everything else was below average. but fast service you may need to share tables with others though.,3
angry staff food was of poor quality overall bad experience here will not be comming back,1
"staff are not friendly, and food is a bit pricey",1
"not impressed with the beijing dumplings, the wrappers were thick and stodgy and the filling was bland. ",2
fresh dumplings made in front of you. great bubble tea much better quality compared to over sweetened colourful drinks you find at bubble tea bars in the area. ,4
"cram yourself in there and enjoy the dumpling prepared just now on the table next to you. you can have bubble tea if you really must but it is far from the best around so dumplings, dumplings and more dumplings, preferably fried. they are quite basic but definitely fresh.well worth the wait for a table corner.",4
absolutely lovely,5
need up dating,4
"i met my wife here 12 years ago! :) if you only have a few pounds in your pocket, the desire to have a nice, simple chinese meal, and no desire whatsoever to meet someone for any sort of romantic relationship, but then get married and have a couple kids with them... this is the place to go.",5
"great food, the dumplings are highly recommended. be prepared to share a table this isn't a high cuisine restaurant, just great dumplings at a good price.",4
amazing dumplings!!! a must if youre in the area,5
"the beijing and fried dumpling. both were ok. however, i definitely recommend the honey bbq pork and rice.",4
"service is horrible and rude, they don't even understand english. the worst food in china town. it's totally disgusting. be careful. ",1
"one of the most delicious and familiar restaurants in london, i love",5
after coming here a few times i came to the conclusion that the dumplings and soup are the only thing i like here. meat is more bone and skin. fried dumplings are good.and really like the won ton soup.,4
"amaizing dumplings thats true and yeah they microwave the food,yeah the service can be rude too but is something about the place and the food i dont know, when i go there i know what to spec and i always have a good time",3
"so i followed the advice given in the other reviews and just tried the steamed beijing dumplings. i am no expert in the field, but i liked them. i went in the evening during a week day and i did not find any queue, which was fine. it makes a good option if you need a quick and cheap bite when in soho.",3
it's ok,3
one thing i love and absolutely love is their fu qing fish ball soup!! its fishball with minced pork inside. this is the only thing that keep bring me back to this place and i highly recommend this dish!!,4
"wonderful food, amazing duck and great dumplings!",5
"9 fr 6 small dumplings is terrible value for money. charge far less or give better sized portions; your dumplings are good, but that price bracket is despicable.",3
the best dumplings i ever ate. so what if it's not got a fancy layout. go for the food ,5
love this place - hustle bustle and so authentic. no frills. delicious.,4
"great dumplings prepared everyday right in front of their customers, fast service, and a great location (imho) makes this one of my favourite places to grab a quick lunch. it's not fancy and service is not top notch, but that actually adds to its charm as far as i'm concerned.",5
these hand made dumplings never disappoint! be ready to share your table with strangers. ,5
poor cantonese restaurant selling bad quality foods. ordered char siu rice and wonton soup but it is either good at toast or authentic in cantonese style. just a restaurant in a good location that attracts innocent tourists. ,1
"i never leave reviews - but thought i would this time to save a life. i actually wish i could give no stars instead of one. the food and bubble tea is absolutely disgusting,  and the wait staff is horribly rude. will never return to this place again.",1
dumplings specialist. it is a fast food ambience you would find in china. so don't expect service with a smile. that said the quality of the food is much higher than any other fast food.,4
did not go to this place.keeps piping up for feed back!,1
rubbish food and service. i'm literally paying 5 for frozen squid rings and lemon water (which they call lemon tea).,1
not the best food but no pretensions.  friendly service (in context),4
just perfect,5
great for fresh dumplings ,5
slow food serving with very very bad customer service.,1
don't bother! go to another place!,2
great food and drinks!!,5
the dumplings are really nice!,4
delicious and authentic dumplings (beijing-style and vegetarian) for a good price.,5
quick pit stop for some handmade dumplings is always a nice experience here! get the fried ones for extra crisp! cash only and you will share a table with others. not intended for longer stays.,5
best dumplings i ever tasted. very cheap but quality ingridients. a classic.,5
"cheap, quick and cheerful - don't expect super doting waitstaff or silver cutlery, but the beijing dumplings are excellent, as is the shredded pork and pickled cabbage noodle soup.",5
great dumplings! friendly staff :),5
food somewhat good. portions are small. the place is small but cosy. pearl tea/coffee - no no.,3
"had dumblings there, it was the worse dumblings that i have ever eaten. thicker skin with untasted fillings. i would not recommend.",1
one of the best places in london,5
"good just for the dumplings, really top class dumplings. bad customer service, al the rest of the men is not very good.",3
"dumplings are probably some of the worst you can get in chinatown. nice people, terrible food.",1
"very poor chinese restaurant . dumplings re-heated in microwave , broccoli in the flour . the lady in the counter is very rude , she was speaking badly to customers .",1
"one of the best chinese restaurants/cafes in london,  cheap, fresh with noodles and dumplings done fresh all day long. service is not the best and is not the most spacious place,but the quality of food is amazing. and the possibility of eating a delicious healthy meal for less than a tenner is impressive. ",5
"very rude staff and you're not made to feel welcome at all. in the end we only ordered drinks and not food, and my drink was lukewarm. would never go there again. ",1
their duck noodle soup was ok. but very good dumplings. definitely will come back for that.,4
i found their dumplings to be very tasty actually!,3
"been here once and never again. quality of the ingredients is very low and costs hardly anything. they use magi noodles and charge 7. as one of the supposed cheaper eats in chinatown, its a rip off.",1
i wasn't expecting to be served instant noodles.... instant noodles. for 7pounds.,1
they should use chinese rice instead of long grain,1
"dumplings are not that good and the whole place stinks, the one and the only positive thing i can say is that it's cheap.",2
"i have not eaten there, but this is the place to buy your dumplings!! either uncooked or cooked, vegetarian or with pork. they are fantastic!",4
rushed and not great quality... look elsewhere for better wonton,2
"decent food, but poor service and atmosphere. exactly what you can expect from a chinese place.",3
"quite basic, but does the job for a quick drink or some dumplings. i had the grass jelly drink, 3 and it didn't taste of anything.",3
famous for its dumplings. cheap and fast service.,4
fresh hand made beijing dumplings ,5
great dumpling and quick service. watch the ladies in the window make dumplings!,5
dumplings!!!!! so so very good. cash only though.,5
great fresh dumplings,5
"very authentic, amazing dumplings, see the food being made.",5
simple and good value. relaxed and home made feel. great beijing dumplings - nom nom. ,4
"good food, done quick and not pricey. don't expect to have a long leisurely meal there as they'll want your chairs for the next lot ",5
"i honestly don't know how everyone raves about the dumplings here... it doesn't even taste great, but gloopy, laced with vinegar ir chill oil to mask the 'taste', service is so rude as well!!the only good thing about this store is watching someone make dumplings at the window. this you can do from outside.",1
"the service is totally not nice driven by old people, i did not have enough cash to pay 6.5, they tried to keep my phone until i withdrew money and pay by cash.",1
very clean,4
the most authentic and reasonably priced duck rice and choy sum with oyster sauce in chinatown...i felt like i was back in a similar style cafe in hong kong.,4
yummy,4
cheap but good beijing dumplings; steamed and fried.,3
delicious pearl teas and dumplings,5
mediocre handmade dumplings in cafeteria style setting with marginal hygiene.  paid 10 for plate of greens and order of fried vegetarian dumplings.,3
just had a drink here on a hot day. the ice lychee drink was refreshing but expensive seeing as it came out of a carton.,3
"nice people and service, but the food is terrible by any standards. dry meats, soups that are basically water and salt, and floppy dumplings that taste like soaked pizzas. do yourself a favour and get a pret sandwich.",1
expensive and bad food. it's not worth visiting it.,1
terrible experience... rude service and instant low-quality tea,1
dumplings dumplings dumplings!!!!!! ,5
. ,5
fried dumplings,5
bomb ass food ,5
2nd best dumplings in london,5
always a pleasure,5
traditional chinese food.,5
love them dumplings!,4
the worst services ever. the worst dumplings ever.,1
dumpling's are nice and everything represents good value even for chinatown.,4
dumplings were very medicore and don't take card,3
tasty and pretty cheap food ;),5
"authentic food, casual dining.",4
the handmade dumplings are simply awesome!,4
dont ever call yourself a chinese restaurant. instant noodles?,1
terrible. that's the pic how i look at my food the bobble tea was weird,1
"casual and yummy,  no frills food",4
love this place. their freshly made dumplings are so tasty! this is a very informal place where you're expected to share a table and not linger for too long.,5
"service very slowwhen i finished my dinner, my girlfriend's dinner didn't come for about 15-20min.we want cancelled the meal, but they always say coming or making, just let us wait for a long time.",1
"pretty decent food, but amusingly questionable service.",4
"best hot pot in london by a stretch.  great broth, great ingredients, excellent value.  dumplings are better than those at almost all dumpling restaurants in london.  and are included in the price of the hot pot.",5
food was amazing!  super busy so be ready to wait,5
authentic hot pot option in london conveniently located in china town. service typical of restaurants in china town and if you're just interested in the food you should definitely try it!,4
i went with a friend and we had to wait for 40 min but the hotpot was very good. it was worth waiting for,5
nice hot pot. good food,5
what a great place to eat hot pot. very nice people to help and support you.,5
"lovely restaurant! the food always amazing! good service lovely staffs cheap price in central area, can be the best chinese restaurant in london",5
"great, inexpensive all you can eat hotpot.",4
"good food, service catastrophic. very weird additions to the bill, claiming they can't replace a plate because they ran out, and often play fighting between waitresses. worse than parisian standards.",2
"really nice hotpot, friends are happy,will go back again.",5
the quality of the food is bad. bugs flying around. never never come again!,1
"one of the best hot pots in london, good value for money",4
"food is average but with low quality service. they keep urging us to leave from 10pm but the close time is 11pm, i was playing with my phone when eating and the waiter asked me stop playing and eat my food. bad service ever.",1
food just average and service is poor in addition restaurant is messy. cleanliness is not very good.,1
"faultless noodle dishes, especially the wuhan noodles and bizarrely, the excellent laksa. the chef i was informed, is malaysian. service is better than the usual chinatown tedium.",5
"there have all you can eat hot pot around 24 per head, taste not bad and the staff are friendly.left one is tomato soup and right one is pig's stomach with pepper soup.",4
"food was ok, nothing special (i didnt have the hot pot which looked good). our waitress was ok but the rest of the staff seemed a bit rude and threw our dishes in the table. toilets wouldnt flush and there was a used sanitary pad in an open bin in the mens toilet. wouldnt go again.",2
great service. food was delicious! highly recommended. ,5
bought a take out.quite a wait but very worth it. wonderful food.,5
really nice hotpot,4
"they dont always give you the complete order when theyre busy, not sure if its intensional. nice variety of things for hot pot.",4
"over priced for average chinese food. service is appalling, it's not very clean and you can't flush the toilet paper. ",3
great hotpot all you can eat for 25 and customers are mostly chinese. the soup bases are really good and the pork stomach soup base is highly rated! beware that there is a time limit- be strategic!,5
"great food, but restaurant is bit old and not very nice. however if you wole like to eat delicious food in decent price - you should try!",4
"foods were very yummy although service was the worst i ever had in china town. i told them it was very nice foods, no smile or thank you but annoyed face. they don't even bring you plate if you don't ask. we loved the foods but may not go back.",2
"not the great service but it's everywhere in chinatown. beer was warm but they changed it (reluctantly, tho). the food was good, orange after meal on the house was refreshing.",3
"stay with me on this one. this place is a bit grimy, with its dirty walls and a dodgy hole in the floor beneath my chair. but the food we had here was absolutely delicious!no frills to put it mildly but a great spot for a wonderful, flavourful lunch!ill definitely be back.",4
"great hotpot, make sure to order lots. busy friday evening so be ready to que or get their early",5
"their services are terrible, not kind,and not friendly. food is ok but i dont go anymore",1
it's an ok place to eat. my husband and i enjoyed the meal.,4
"no frills hotpot buffet including thin slices of meat, tasty soup bases, and also dumplings. can enjoy the food here as long as you don't expect great service...",4
great authentic food & fab service,5
rude service and the staff only cares about turning more tables! place is dirty as well. i'd rather spend my money somewhere else.,1
good value food.,5
"slow serviceforgets orders and borderline eatable ingredients, for the all you can eat.",1
"the spicy  hot pot was very good but be careful where you sit or you might get spicy chilli fumes blowing in your face from the a/c unit. the service was a bit slow, we had to ask for our drinks several times before they arrived, although this was when the restaurant was very busy.",4
"love their hot pot, money for value is good, taste is nice as well.",5
"> please like helpful reviews < ordered 2 dishes for takeaway, but got back to my apartment and only 1 dish was in the bag. clearly out to make unethical money out of people in a rush. wouldn't recommend.",1
friendly staff and very good food,5
the staff was very friendly and helped us with our order :),5
"the best place to have hotpot in town. only 24 for all you can eat. the soup bases are really rich and delicious. there is a wide range of ingredients to choose and they are all fresh. love the fish particularly. when i feel like a chinese hotpot, this is the place i always come.",5
"really tasty and good service. my favorite place to do hot pot in london. but i do find it a bit expensive for the quality of the hot pot ingredients, and the service is authentic so you have to flag down your waiter (not necessarily a bad thing). careful that it gets really busy!",4
hotpot and food is certainly good. but service is disappointing and rude.,1
great oriental sichuan spicy food!!!,5
great unassuming & unpretentious chinese restaurant serving astoundingly tasty hotpot bone soup all you can eat cook yourself food. service was attentive and helpful helping us through our confusion which turned to delight as the mountains of food arrived and consumed with lip smacking groans of pleasure. highly recommended.,5
best chinese hot pot in london! must come! definitely visit again soon!,5
nice food and big portions. we were the only people not having a hot pot! service was reasonably good. kind of expensive for what it was.,3
they are so so so slow!!!!!!!,1
i love it ,5
poor service,1
good,5
best hotpot !!,4
wonderful hot pot!,5
"amazing foods, real gem!",5
love this place. from extremly good hotpot to noodle soups. even main dishes are good. really authentic and not pricey. filled with chinese people (if you're white you'll probably be the only one). i just wish i lived closer to this place.,5
meh mediocre over priced poor quality food there are a dozen other places close by that a cheaper and most importantly much tastier life is too short for bad food and life is too short for this half assed lazy attempt at a pop up restaurant two words never again!,1
food is ok but service is slow and inattentive. looks like they don't want to be there. ,2
too expensive a can of coke cost 2 same price a bowl of plain rice also i saw pieces of hair in my friends rice and the vegetable soup never going there again in my life the soup and rice were cold and disgusting  i could nearly even eat the food. it was a waste of my money,1
food was great although customer service could be improved,3
ok,5
nice and delicious,4
"the hot pot there is very good and they have amazing dumplings, but their service is quite poor.",4
very rude stuff and impatient service.,1
best boba matcha in london.,5
tiny shop with no seats. take away only. matcha crepe so nice and creamy. the matcha boba is very milky and not enough matcha flavour. 5.45 pricey for a medium size bubble tea as next door theres two other bubble tea shops that are better and cheaper.,3
always liked the macha mille crepe when kova used to just have one location at soho. also like the sea salt lava cake. the new cheezo tea caught up quickly. will be better if it has some sitting but i guess its hard to come by in such an popular area,4
order a black sugar bubble tea this afternoon. feels like drinking water with boba. and the one i have receive don't actually look like others who have comment below. p.s i didn't mix it . throw the whole drink straight away after i have a sip,1
gorgeous cheezo drinks,5
the sea salt cheese lava cake is heavenly! looking forward to trying something new the next time,5
the matcha mille crepe was the best! the price was 5.95 per slice,5
always enjoy their sea salt cheese lava cake!,4
"authentic japanese patisserie  cakes are quite expensive but a good treat; you wont be disappointed! matcha crepe cake is a must try, personal favourite is the earl grey crepe cake.",5
we ordered the lava sea salt cheesecake and it was amazing. the texture is excellent and the cake tastes really amazing. ordered an 8 cake for 12 people and it was lit!! definitely worth buying the cake!,5
"this is alright dessert cafe. i have ordered cheese , match, chocolate and crepe cake. cheese cake is good and rest of them is alright. not bad but not so special. i think it is little over priced. i like the individual package was really good.and i can be the plate for the cake.  nice.",3
amazing bubble tea and cheezo tea! also in a great location!,5
youngish crowd but not unwelcoming so for us oldies. ,3
love this place.. gets better every time  x,5
nice staff. popular place in the evening. nice both prosecco and aperol sprtiz,4
"gay bar but open to anyone. ended up there with some friends, music is ok and free entry (not sure it's like that every night). nothing to raise in either good or a bad way. the drinks are not particularly cheap.",3
was today and i had couples of beers after pay the ticket of 8 them went for a cigarret outside them they told me the porter to wait in the main bar for a plastic glass again....very disappointed  to wait again all the line when the porter should have plastic glass to go outside,1
absolutely dreadful bar with new manager. gary henshaw should be disgusted with his new management,1
"love the club, music is always good and the atmosphere is great, you can dance away the night!",5
"awesome night here, full of good people. a wonderful experience overall! nice cocktails!",5
"my first ever visited london gay bar; this place continues to be a beacon of safety, comfort, fun and security for me and all i know.",5
"it's a nice bar with pretty decor, however, it's too narrow and very busy most of the times.",4
"been going to ku for years. overall, it's not bad. it's a gay bar in soho, at the weekend, it's rammed, what do you expect?really wish they'd clear the bar stools on busy evenings, it makes it so difficult to get to the bar to order drinks.that's probably my only gripe.it's london prices.",4
decent bar. nice atmosphere. drinks are not very cheap.,4
nice fitout and polite staff and security (which is pretty rare),5
friendly service. wine not great and a bit overpriced.,3
"one of the best pre-drinking bars in central london, again a little pricey but fun.",4
"one of my favorite places in soho, however some of the staff really need to sort out their attitude issues. you are a barman darling, not a chanel model! ",4
"friendly staff, big, 3 level bar and central location. gets very busy at weekends",3
"friendly and lively, lots of tv screens. ",5
the man staff,5
bar staff are nasty,1
"expensive, arrogant staff",2
just tried to get in refused entry as to many girls found some guys still refused entry rude bouncer its saturday night.....awful ,2
friendly staff,4
soho,4
"the bar staff has really good manners, service is fast, but the loo is disgusting",4
loved my night! friendly crowd and great music! recommend 5*,5
always a fun  night out,5
very disappointed and never go back there again!!! the bar manager has a very bad attitude for serving customer and very rude. ,1
handsome men and nice drinks! ,5
"dismissive staff, totally unprofessional, to the extent that if they read this.. they will laugh.  i was trying to order a drink at lunchtime. i was ignored,  in favour of customers known to the bar staff.avoid",1
"friendly staff, cool bar, easy going people",5
nice bar with good music and beautiful bar tenders! ,4
it has won awards for all the right reasons! staff and customers are welcoming.,5
great barsexy staff,5
"hi,i visited last week and was very fantastic experience.a lot of drink to enjoy.",3
nice place to chat and have some drinks. the staff is very friendly but a bit slow,4
sooo much fun! will be back!,5
"very poor management. very rude, attitude and etc.  thank you, next.",1
"good location. went here for drinks on a sunday afternoon so not all of it was open, but was still good.",4
do you think sticking your finger up someones bum then wiping it under someones nose is good. because that is what dave farrell and jamie laughran do.,5
"the staff is friendly, the main floor with the bar was packed and the small club downstairs was fine but kinda empty, they charge a fee to enter.",4
never been here but they leave the external heaters on all day. what a waste of energy... shame on them.,1
great drinks and cool gay bar.,4
it is a very lovely place to just hangout with friends and have few drinks.,5
a place full of colour,4
"nope nope nope.- - -there's plenty of things going wrong here. and ""high costumer standards"" is not applicable on someone copy/pasting answers on all honest 1-star reviews. best to stay away from here.",1
the best place to enjoy,5
best club in london!,5
"very very rude people, so much attitude and sussyness for no reason! leaved the place shocked cause of the writer behavior. not gonna step into this bar ever again !!",1
very nice staff i love this place lovely,5
cheap and nasty sound system. like a low end home stereo that's blasted so loud it's excruciating to listen to. all treble and no bass. for this reason alone avoid going there because it ruins the whole experience. please change your rubbish speakers so we aren't punished with this any longer!!,1
looking forward to go back!!,5
"yes , a very up market venue, extreamly nice decor, quite lavish , staff seem polite , maybe try to smile, gives me the hump ,  when u get no output, rather robotic, never the less, relaxed  and charmingly soothing atmosphere.",5
amazing place with amazing staff,5
nice vibe,4
we booked a table for after a theatre play. on arriving the bar staff and manager were helpful and found our table. the atmosphere as always was lively but not over the top. great place for after theatre drinks before partying the night away.,5
"this place used to be just ok, but now its dire. the new manager, looks around 16 years old, is trying to attract a weatherspoons straight student crowd and he has succeede. also no chinese people in the middle of chinatown, very suspicious. avoid if you value your night out.",1
sexy staff there and nice friendly gay guys. but the only thing is the floor which is too sticky for the nice shoes lol ,4
one of my favourite gay bars in soho. topless barmen add to the appeal. ,4
a wonderful place for a late night out. the downstairs is the perfect place for dancing. ,5
"good music, good vibe, good location. kuklub, located just downstairs, took a bit of time to get crowded, but once people started flowing in the energy followed. only minus is that the water tasted like it came straight from the toilet. just a heads up to the non-drinkers :d",4
"just onetime i was go,good location & nice inside",3
gay;),5
i had so much fun here i've been to ruby tuesdays every week i've been in london.,5
"a soho institution, great range of drinks and cocktails, djs often on with a club downstairs and excellent cocktail bar above",5
rude staff.,1
really nice bar. gets very busy so get there early.,4
"pity i cant rate less. high entrance fee, expensive bar, prefab dj mixes that not even fix the atmosphere.no go for people who want to have a fun night out.",1
"lots of fun, drinks are reasonable and atmosphere is fun.",4
"one of my favourite gay bars in london. love the size of it and feel. if you want to go and have a few drinks instead of hard clubbing, this is the place to go. ",5
"the only good thing about this place is the new decoration. the music is the most boring mainstream chart. the staff behind the bar is obnoxious and on top of that they sell stale beer! to avoid. ""award winning"" what a joke!",2
"a real gem! one of the longest standing gay bars in soho, will always off you a great night, which ever night of the week it is. the re launch of their club is going to be great, be sure not to miss this place if you're visiting london.",5
"the only times i visited this bar, were on tuesdays, courtesy of ruby tuesdays! it's just a great place for a relaxing drink, to see and be seen!drinks from as little as 1.50 and the music is always very trendy and uplifting ... after all ... you do need it to get by the rest of the week =) ",5
no comment,3
quando fui em 2013 foi maravilhoso. hoje de volta em londres irei l para curtir a noite.,5
i walked half way across london to get here because they were supposed to be open until 3. then they closed at midnight. update your hours! it would take you five minutes.,1
best club in london! the music is amazing and there is always a great dj playing.,5
"love the place, love the bouncers, the staff, but mostly giulia henne playing there all the time. shes an amazing unicorn",5
i love luis and the bar staff. so professional you dont have to be gay to approach this bar. they are friendly and so wellcoming. i will always come back to this bar when i visit london.,5

great vibes! i always have a fab time here!,5
went there with my friends and loved the music and the people. fantastic place and you should meet stefanos... best lad i have ever met!!!!!!,5
its a good bar but the bar staff have no sense of urgency at all. you stand waiting to be served quietley and politely but they just keep walking past. i guess they are hired on their looks as opposed to their general efficiency... beauty fades,2
the staff are some of the best i have seen... great table service great customer service and an overall great vibe. will 100% return.,5
"i visit london often (from san francisco) and ku bar has been one the most fun and memorable experiences i have had while roaming the streets!!! the bar tenders were exceptional, had our drinks ready in no time, and the drinks themselves were perfect! we shall come back on weekends!!!",5
"stephanos hosting is one good reason to come to this classic again and again. mixed crowd and good vibes upstairs, at the light lounge and the klub.",5

"great location with extreme friendly staff and the cocktails are outstanding - try the mojito, i bet you will not regret it. promised!",5

we went on a monday but it was still really fun. great drink prices and chill vibe. but play more danceable music... more cardi b ,5
reasonably priced drinks. welcoming to all.,4

"love this place! visited nwith my african friends and was such a vibrant, multi ethnic crowd. great music and hosts.",5
"best place for drinks, music and to socialise. staff are friendly. highly recommended. 10/10 ",5
"small place, poor service and the music was way too loud. wasted money by going there.",1
is this still a gay bar? i dont think it is. the crowd and the tv showing rugby. please mates dont give me that. i didnt feel i was in a gay bar for gay people. this is a pub for whoever comes in. shame. shame shame.,1
first time here for 10 years and its still a good night,3
they still use plastic straws. very backward. 06/08/19,1
always good djs,5

super fun place in london....bartenders were so nice!!!,5
really attentive staff!,5
wary nice bar,5
nice place to dance and make friends,5
we went to the cocktail bar upstairs and the bar men were so rude to us.,1
lovely place ,5
"reading some of these reviews makes me think i am in the wrong venue. very welcoming every time i come in. professional door staff, very good cocktails and a decent guinness. i have had some issues here in the past, but now it is a superb place. i personally cannot fault it, and i am a fussy sod.",5
"easily one of the best gay venues of the ""famous london gay bar"" set.  always busy and often crowded however the friendly disposition of the staff is consistent regardless. my theory is this is in part responsible for the general good nature of the patrons also. a must no matter the time of day.",4
friendly gay bar in chinatown. it attracts a mixed crowd of different ages and nationalities.  pop music and young waiters.,4
melhor lugar,5
one of the best bars in the central london,5
one of most nicest bars in london also very friendly staff especially stefanos  must come place!,5

bad customer service. the food was good quality/price.15:00      11/10/19,1
"food tasted amazing. delicious vegan food here. one of the few places that makes tasty vegan food and with no cross contamination. had a wrap, a burger and brazilian beans and all were great. prices are also normal compared to other restaurants in central london. would recommend it especially for vegans and vegetarians.",5
"lovely food and service. i had the vegan burger and, for a non vegan, i can just say it was as tasty as a beef burger, so flavourful, and totally filling and appetising. the lady at the counter was nice and helpful, as this was my first visit, and i will definitely go back.",4
service was quite poor and the food was expensive for what you get sadly.,2
the best fast food place to eat in london..,5
"staff member really wasnt pleasant, sadly the food wasnt up to much either...please look at the photos attached, disappointing!!!flies all over the food, i did alert the cashier who didnt seem bothered.",1
"located in the heart of piccadilly. offer good variety of both dine in and take away. my personal best was thai curry , why dont you give it a try ",5
"great, healthy food with fantastic, speedy service! a lovely place to go when eating alone for lunch but they do a breakfast menu as well as a good selection of cakes. great for gluten free food but the people are their real seeking point just so helpful and cheery! makes a big difference on a dull january day!",5

value for money,4
"good quality food. good service. my first visit to leon, i had thought it was vegetarian, (that's not a problem), but not so. satay chicken dish was very good. i liked the dark chocolate chips on my decaffeinated cappuccino as well.",4
got the chipotle vegan avocado burger. it wasn't that great however the fries were good. and a korean mayonnaise. i also got their limit gingerbread deserve it was pretty good. customer service was good,3
"first time visitor to the restaurant, just wanted some quality fast food. not disappointed. wide range of food, i had the chicken burger all breast no reformed breaded chicken.  very tasty although in hindsight should have tried the turkey curry xmas special. tasty.",5
"first time ever in a leon. had tea and something called a ""better brownie"". and you know what? it was! it was a rich chocolate and nut fest of a brownie - delicious. not as expensive as i expected either. ",5
the sicilian chicken meat balls dish not as nice as the lental meal. key code for all in one shared female/male disabled toilet in the basement without disabled access!a sliding door access with spacious seating on ground and basement level.,2
"chicken burger was tiny (when unwrapped i could only see bun as the contents were so flat), chips were lukewarm and chewy but the chicken katsu box was quite nice. overall very unimpressed.",2
very tasty food in this fast food restaurant. great location. downstairs seating.,5
lovely coffee and i love the concept of leon. brekky items delicious,5
absolutely fantastic please expand and open some branches up north,5

in 4 days in london i felt so hard in love with leon  :-),5

what a great little place! great food at great prices. friendly staff with live singing. fabulous atmosphere!,5
totally in love with this place!!,5
"asked staff if they was anywhere that i could wash my hands before eating my meal, a resounding no was the answer. had to eat with dirty hands a bit unhygienic really as most of the food in lyon you have to pick up.",1
leon has some great healthy food options. their selection of  salads is really good. good service and very clean restaurant.,5
"lovely food.disabled access is awful.. as a wheelchair user, the experience is so dispiriting, especially for a chain that prides itself on being so ethically astute. no accessible toilet on the entrance level and facilities are on only the second floor to which there is no lift.a sorry state of affairs.",2
the best place to eat something fast in a healthy way. a nice place,5
"uncooked rice, wasted food and money, as could not finish it.",1
"simply good, simple, tasty food. service quick, helpful and courteous. if a quick meal or snack is what you need i recommend visiting leon",5

super healthy eating. very fresh. is perfect to eat here because is no heavy.,5
"what concerns me about the #metoo movement is the accumulation of other injustices, perceived and real, to the same banner. oh, and avoid the baked fries. everything else here is tasty.",4
"so disappointing and flavourless, was it always like this? i'm sure i have fonder memories of this place, yet everytime i go to one of these chains i am disappointed by their clearly microwaved food.",1
good food. well priced. friendly staff. i will be back.,5
great fast healthy food restaurant. i liked the idea of the different meals in cardboard boxes. the service is quite fast and the quality of the food is really good.,5
one of the best deals in soho,5
"great value food, fast service.",5
"fantastic spot. cheapest breakfast around, but also the best we could find, and in a really nice venue. very friendly staff.",5
"crowded and rather mediocrely maintained, but that's expected in such location. nothing special, as for every chain restaurant. food is cheap and tastes ok, only difference is that it's rather healthy in comparison to other kinds of 'fast food'.",3
"i'd seen leon in king's x, but never really bothered with it, and i actually thought it was a mini mart for some reason. as it happens they do some healthy, different snacks here. as well as decaf drinks",5
they only provide single-use disposable cutlery and cups and there are no recycling facilities. this is totally irresponsible and selfish. its time for leon to wake up to the plastic waste crisis.,1
leon is ok but i do think its overpriced for the portion sizes.,2
alguna opcion vegana,4
"eu paguei 4,95 . por arroz, feijo e carne. pelo preo digo que vale a pena. sai satisfeita",5
each town of this world should have a leon!,5

"the best burgers from someone that normally hates burgers. light, healthy and super tasty",5
good esspresso,5
"the meal i had was gorgeous! aioli chicken for anyone wondering, the slaw on the side was really fresh and beautifully made, staff were helpful when i had no idea what somethings where and the sheer amount of vegan and gluten free food available was some of the best selection i've ever seen! highly highly recommend",5
"food delicious, staff very friendly, place very clean, love it :-)",5
leon is best restaurant to serve porridge across london,5
"it's a chain, so no unique experience or cozy setting but the food is better than what you get at most chains. pricing is similar to pret, eat etc but the food here taste much better. also has many gluten-free options (including chicken nuggets!)",5
"would be 5 stars for the great quality of food and service.however, they insist on having the doors wide open (even in the winter) which makes it very cold to eat in. @leon - you could save money and keep customers happier.",3
love it! healthy food that tastes great!! highly recommend if you're in london and looking for fresh and healthy food!,5
food wasn't really hot as they advertise....,2
bom preo e almoo de verdade,5
tried these wings and a live burger. either over cooked or had been sitting for a while as they had a rubbery taste to them. poor.,2
"friendliest staff.  good food. great for food allergies/sensitivities.  accidentally drop my closed drink and it started spraying the floor.  staff so nice, cleaning up immediately and even brought me a new drink which i wasnt expecting.  loved leon before but this made my view on the fast food restaurant that much better.",5
nice healthy fast food,5
"a leon restaurant with naturally fast food. the staff at this restaurant was very friendly taking my order and quickly prepared it. the burger tasted good and was hot,  the same with the  fries. the restaurant has places to sit down on two levels, but  no places  outside m. the restaurant as a whole looked very clean",5
"nice food, reasonable price",4
"very good, affordable food with many veggie options. very quick service, as soon as you ordered something, it was already on the tray.",4
chicken burger was ok a little lacking in chicken,3
pretty good quality compared to price,5
poor customer service. not feeling to come back to this leon. 15:00 11/10/19,1
watch when you go to toilet. even with door locked someone didn't take the hint that it was occupied and managed to open the door. thankfully i was no longer on the loo!,3
the place is very clean. the food is delicious. but the toilets dont close.i recomand this place,4
love this place. currently my favourite place to eat :),5
"no gluten free burger any more. apparently its meant to come back this year, but for now theres one less thing to eat if you need gluten free food. there are salad options though.",3
like the quiet downstairs and healthy food,4
leon food is always disappointing. portions not great and flavours are all just a bit 'meh'. there are so many better (and cheaper) places to eat in london!,2
usually grab lunch here. always fast and fresh,5
"really enjoyed the food at le hanoi, i had the pork spring rolls and the beef pho and they were really tasty. the service was also good. i would recommend a visit and i am definitely returning in future!",5
excellent food with good customer service . well done,5
"good food but customer service isnt the best, waiters need to smile more and act like they want to be here, had to go get the menu myself one time. the buon cuon here is very good, so i would recommend and go if youre willing to wait around until they approach you.",3
great little vietnamese in china town!,4
"so so delicious pho. the vegetable pho is so good, but the beef pho is amazing! it is a restaurant with a cooking full of flavours. the price you pay is very reasonable for what you get, so it become a very good option for anyone who wants to eat in london. it worths the visit to chinatown for that pho.",5
good quality price to be london. tasty food. only problem is that they brought the bill without asking.,4
nice food and great service,5
very good quality fresh food. good lunch menu.,5
"very nice vietnamese food, good service,  basic decor",4
i am vietnamese. i went to this restaurant and had 3 dishes. quite good but not very good. some of the staffs are vietnamese but the owners speaks chinese. love vietnamese authentic food. hope the quality will go up. cheers,4
"for asians not even close to authentic taste. if you are s foreigner and want to have some idea what pho tastes like it would be okay. othetwise, not recommended.",2
good selection of food. very tasty and fair value for the area. liked the ambience and service. the cha la.lot is delicious and so is the chicken drum stick pho. ,5
"its a vietnamese restaurant.. tried the bbq pork and it was really delicious... the soup underneath will be slightly sweet, but was really nice...",4
omg 1. service terrible!!! ordered earlier but served later than others.2. insane price they charge most expensive special charge during christmas. 6 pounds for a bottle of water.3. taste changednoodle was already cut it means noodle was too old. and they just want to serve to many ppl not quality food at all.,1
"good food, good service, and a good price for the portions.not too crowded either.can't fault it.",5
not bad but probably could be a little better. the tofu dishes were good but probably not rush back again.,4
"love this place. from the chopsticks to the loos. it's only been open for 2 weeks so i hope they keep the attention to detail on the venue and service. the food was superb. the beef stick starter was the best steak i've tasted in a long time.    this is one to watch.  as word spreads, getting a table might not be as easy. ",5
"great service. great food. probably the best vietnamese in london. highly recommend the pho, quality of meat was superb. will definitely go back. ",5
amazing food - brought back happy memories  from my time in vietnam. morning glory is always a must,4
"delicious!portions on the small size, but very flavorful dishes.  we had pho, green papaya salad and spring roll.  the spring roll with taro crust was a wonderful surprise.  the papaya salad was very flavorful.  and i drank every last drop the broth in the pho.  a bit pricey, but would come again. ",4
"nice vietnamese food, the egg fried noodles with beef was delicious. they have nice decorations and the place was big enough to host 6 of us for dinner.",4
excellent beef pho,5
"the food was average at best, very tasteless and not cooked well. the service was not very good, too much attitide. only reason for one star was decent wine.",1
"meh. nothing special. food wasnt amazing. service and location are great but the restaurant itself isnt anything amazing. id skip it, though portions are massive so if youre starving might be your place.",2

"tried pho, dumplings, stir fried noodles, some beef starter - loved them all",5
tasty food and nice staff.my family and i have a good lunch time.,5
"food was okay, service was terrible and the server was rude and said everyone at our table must order a main dish (even though 2 of them already ate)",1
"came for the banh cuon, was very nice although not the best i've had.can certainly recommend. will probably go back and sample some of the other dishes.very good prices.",5
"food is good here , i will recommend",4
"the waiter was extremely rude and unpleasant. he looks unhappy while doing his job. they threw the bills on the table, even we didnt ask for the bills yet. wouldnt recommend here.",2
not bad but not a real vietnamese place. chinese run business,3
really delicious spicy beef bun noodle soup have to try other dishes soon,4
good food at good prices considering its location in such a central part of london. the noodles in the pho were quite soggy though but other than that it was yummy!,5
"poor example of vietnamese food. appears to be a 'chinese interpretation' of real vietnamese food. gi cun: mostly lettuce. bnh xo: pancake was like tissue paper, mostly onion. salt and pepper squid: mostly very raw onion. mango/papaya salad (gi): dressing too strong, imitation peanut topping.",2
touristy location. i enjoyed the starters but the mains lacked authenticity. service was good and decor was modern. give it a try though,3
"their lunch time offer is nice, 10 for starter and main, efficient for a quick lunch date. everything else is reasonably priced too! the food is good, above average but dont expect to be blown away. wouldve given it 3 stars based just on food but the staffs attentiveness and speed made me want to give 4.",4
in general the food was excellent. my main course though was very spicy (without having a pepper sign on the menu). there was also a service fee of 4.15 for 3 people; why??!!,2
big guy with glasses is a bit rude. pho noodles  texture isnt the best. fast service but i wouldnt come back.,3
"i ordered a soup, i could have eaten for 2 days! it was delicious!",4
"good food, nice taste. bud time between starter and main course was an hour thuis is too long. our neighbours where later in and much quicker done with eating a starter and main course.",5
grilled bbq pork with vermicelli is amazing! i had this dish for the first time here but it won't be the last time. the staff very friendly,5
"it's ok... i've been to better vietnamese restaurants though! my partner ordered the beef brisket pho and enjoyed it. i, on the other hand, ordered the chilli pork chop with boiled rice and in all honesty, it wasn't very nice... the restaurant's environment was decent and the staff were nice enough though.",3
"reasonably priced, friendly vietnamese spot. tasty food, but not exceptional. i had the cold noodles with tofu and it was a great dish for a warm day in london. recommended if you need a quick and easy bite.",4
very good overall. beef noodle soup was spice good.  children noodle soup was not spicy and good.  good service.,5
well done. banh cuon is very tasty and the rare beef salad is pretty good. the hot mint made it special and good flavour.,5
a very delicious lunch special of crispy spring roll and lemon grass chicken.,5
a great place for a reasonable priced meal in london's chinatown. a decent selection of unusual dishes.,4
great taste and good service dont forget to ask a 10% off card for next time,4
pretty bland tasting pho. you are better going just around the corner to the pho & bun if you want great tasting pho.,3
"food is lovely. if you like pork, try the bun thit nuong dish!",4
"its a very good restaurant. the bun bo hue, the pho and the banh cuon are all perfect. the bun bo hue has vietnamese taste, which is spicy, with high-quality beef. the banh cuon is very delicious. the price is not expensive regarding the quality of the dishes. i highly recommend this restaurant.",5
"very poor service. waiters argued loudly amongst themselves and one waiter slammed door&threw trays on counter. my 12 years old daughter was alarmed by his antics that i had to tell one of the other waiters for him to stop. they had the nerve to charge us service on top.food was ok, and some dishes were served tepid cold.",1
"i ordered chicken pho, taste not bad but the texture of noddles extremely soft. the veggie taste good though. my frd order satey , peanut too strong not much satey taste",3
authentic pho,5
lovely food but cramped and sonewhat stuffy if you're seated downstairs.,3
super good pho !!! one of my favorite restaurant,5
very good quality vietnamese conveniently located around the china town area. the rare beef pho was really tasty - both broth and the beef. don't forget to try the banh cuon as a starter you can't find it to all vietnamese restaurants and when you do its cooking is not as original!,4
the broth could have been better but overall delicious. it is very cramped so it was hard to walk in there and the service was very attentive. however it felt like they were rushing us as the server kept peering at us every minute so it was quite uncomfortable.,3
"great food and helpful, friendly and knowledgeable staff. will definitely visit again.",4
the best pho i ate in london. it's hard to find food so good there,5
excellent pho and super friendly service,5
bun cha had too much raw onion and not enough sauce. tofu bao was just bad,2
"the new staple vietnamese restaurant in soho / chinatown. a great selection of dishes and pleasant service. the aubergine starter, fish sauce chicken wings, garlic pho are some of the tastiest dishes i have had in london. plus the it is very affordable!!!",5
"the food was above average but the service can be improved - very important in a competitive eating environment that is chinatown. beef pho had a robust soup stock, spring rolls were so-so. busy at  lunchtime",4
i had the pork bun cuon after hearing it's made especially by a trained bun cuon chef from vietnam. it's a steam rice wrap with pork in. a new tasting experience!!,5
"10+ it's absolutely delicious! i am usually very picky when it comes to food as a good italian, and this place has just surprised me and satisfied me in full dish after dish!not even expensive! and staff is kind and friendly.will come back here to try the rest of the menu asap!",5
delicious food nice service and good price!!we will go back for sure .,4
"tasty food, quick service, not too cramped in for china town, central london.... overall rather splendid!! portions are large, too large! left feeling like i was about to explode!! if there is two of you, youll only need one main and one rice or noodles to share...... certainly dont need a main each !!!! overall very good !! thanks",4
it was ok. not a place i would visit again though.,3
"great food great prices and good service, recommended",5
"food is full of smoke ((( , made a bad experience ",1
bun cha and fried rice was alright. but pho was little bit blend. broth doesn't taste strong as ordinary pho. anyway price was reasonable in central london.,3
got some good duck there.the price is good as well,4
a great beef soup and friendy and helpful staff,5
"the food was delicious and authentic, the staff was friendly and it was not that crowded like other restaurants in chinatown. if you looking for something good with easy prices and calm atmosphere, go there :)",4
awesome pho and a good price! highly recommended,5
fantastic food and friendly staff. we were in a rush pre theatre and they advised us on the quickest dishes. i had the chicken curry which was delicious. will be coming back soon.,5
"been here a couple of times everytime i'm in london, seems a fairly good place each time so happy to keep returning. they've changed the menu since last time but not much else has changed. food was nice, but took a whole betweem courses. value for money is quite good too and they seem to cater for allergys really well.",4
"big portions, the stewed pork belly was extremely succulent also, the grilled aubergine were just as tender.",5
loved this place when it first opened. went recently and its just not the same.,3
"staffs should be trained to understand vietnamese culture, be polite with customers.",2
"better to reverse a table.first, otherwise it is difficult to just walk in. fair service bit pho is authentic",4
delicious food and large portions. the beef pho was particularly tasty and spicy. service was quick and friendly. to pay with card (not contactless) the minimum consumption is 10,4
"in china town, this is probably the most promising place (especially if you're going for viet food)...banh cuon, pho, banh xeo are all delicious! cleaner than most restaurant in the area and reasonable prices too...however, some of the waiting staff are just bloody intrusive",5
"delicious food. so much so we've gone twice. cool digs in this restaurant, great vibe and music. tables were cleaned thoroughly to my delight.",5
"superb. really authentic food, very reasonably priced. i could live on this.",5
outstanding vietnamese food. excellent service,5
"i'm a fan of bnh cun so when i see that on a menu it's a great start and it was nice here. unfortunately they'd sold out of bnh xo, so will have to return to try that. their grilled bbq pork bun was lovely and the flavours of the pork bought back some childhood memories. will definitely return to try their pho and other dishes",4
"good food, careful staff",4
"this place has amazing food, totally chilled ambience, great music, fantastic loos and it's just one of the nicest places in chinatown i've ever been to. will definately be coming back. great veg options too. ",5
"haven been served by the same staff there for several years. nice and friendly people with great service there. highly recommend venice the hairdresser to get everything done for u, all i need to do is just sitting there and relax. thats called professional. the number one salon in china town no doubt. its",5
i had a terrible experience. i spent 200 on a dye and asked my hairdresser in china to bleach my hair once. it kept me from going out for two or three months. the barber with red hair has his own way and can't cut hair at all. i advise you not to come to this barbershop,1
offer professional care in hair nails and beauty all the stylist and therapists are highly professional .the best experience xxxxxx,5
had an appointment with sally who is one of the most friendly and pleasant person ive met. im very happy with the results and satisfied by the professionalism of the staff and the friendliness.  the salon itself is clean and has a lovely atmosphere.,5
"i have been looking for a good hairdresser ever since i moved to london, six months ago, and i have finally found one. i had my hair cut at le salon last saturday - my stylist was wei . he has done a fantastic job.",5
"awesome place. friendly, chilled and would always recommend to anyone. sally my stylist has been cutting my hair for almost 15 years, shes amazing and couldnt recommend her highly enough! :)",5
sally wong is amazing and very talented. she has been looking after me in the last few years. she really knows how to cut males hair. i have never been disappointed. top quality service and cuts!,5
excellent service and good prices! down to earth people!,5
exceptional service once again and really pleased with my new style!  thank you once again guys see you again in a couple of weeks.,5
i've been going here every month for 6 years.  heller knows how to cut my hair exactly how i like it.,5
"have curly/frizzy hair and was very happy with a dry cut by lily, an attentive stylist in this small, friendly salon.",4
"great location in the heart of chinatown, even better for the value and quality. my regular hairdresser sally is a natural, knows how i want my hair whether my usual style or if i want something different!",5
love the experience all the staff are soo cool i recommend anyone need a haircut like how they want le salon is the top no one with great hair wash and cut ,5
great place and staff. xing tong is the best xxx,5
make sure to ask for venice! great cut each time!,5
"this place is amazing, i go here all the time.they cut my hair exactly how i want it to. staff were nice to me and everything. i recommend people to come here!!!",5
"very poor service. the gentleman who washed my hair was very rushed, rough, and unprofessional. the hairdresser also felt very inexperienced as he literally spent 3-5 minutes cutting my and hair then charging me 22. i would never use them again.",1
fiza done hair extentions for me. they have been the best quality i ever had. she is friendly and very welcoming. the prices are really good as well. i need to visit her again as my extention been on my head for about 3+ months.so i need to renew them. she also offers waxing and nails too. ,5
worst experience ever. for three times. never gonna come back again.,1
shirley is great! ,5
i have very good experience on the salon. staff are very friendly and welcoming. venice in particular is very nice. she has been cutting my hair for 4 years now. i can book appointment or just walk in. i would highly recommended the salon and venice.ken,5
good service. when i came here i was attended by a lady called sally. she gave me a good haircut and washed my hair. it was very soothing.,5
great service with excellent staff. visit here  few time for the wash and blow dry with different hairstylist. always satisfied with the service! definitely recommend,5
good food but i have never  been so rushed out in my  life .go somewhere   else..,1
"great food, good services, very friendly, convenient",5
"nice quality dim sum, quick service. no issues.",5
food good. service not special enough to charge 12.5%,3
"real chinese food, tasteful, fresh products, colourful,  delicious in all its choices and courses. we have already been here many times and it is always a pleasure to come back.",5
wonderful place to go and eat unique restaurant.,5
terrible service and low-average food. avoid unless desperately hungry.,2
"crowded and busy on sunday afternoon, which is a good sign. order dim sum off a checklist and they are brought when ready. the dim sum quality was good - freshly made and hot.  have eaten here often now and its now our favourite dim sum place in chinatown.",5
authentic chinese cuisine. delicious and moderately priced. service was good. atmosphere calm. great place for lunch.,4
not the greatest food i've ever had. price was good and the service adequate. just not somewhere that impressed me.,3
"awesome food, quick and affordable. nice big place with great service as well",4
good place for dim sum and roasted meat,4
group of my visitors from the us went there on a saturday afternoon.food was fine but staff were absolutely abysmal.bordering on rude and obvious;y in a hurry to get rid of the customers.not a good experience and not to be repeated.,1
"great food, quick service, kind staff, fair prices. highly recommend king prawn dumplings, pork dumplings with crabmeat, deep fried squid and vietnamese spring rolls with meat. nice experience for celebrating the chinese new year!",5
"had the peking set menu for 2. absolutely stuffed, very pleasantly! quick and friendly service. cheaper than most the other restaurants for a set menu including peking duck (16 each) although there was a service charge added at the end",4
"my personal favourite for a quick dim sum hit. partly nostalgia (been eating here since i was a toddler), partly speed - roast pork puffs on the table in under two minutes, mainly for the pretty good traditional dim sum. nothing fancy, just very tasty",3
"i don't like, i had difficulty to eat",1
"great food, nice relaxing indoor decorations and at a good price. i have been there many times and the food has never let me down. the last time i came, i had been served food within 10 minutes of entering the restaurant. i would recommend visiting it.",5
blacklisted!! no flavour profile at all.everything tastes the same and not worthy of its location.,1
i think this must be of the oldest resturant in china town since 1980s.  standard of dim sum always been good.,5
"great small restaurant, food is delicious and usually has spare tables. my favourite choice in china town.",5
"high price, low quality, small volumes, bad see",1
friendly stuff.portions as expected. price equals portion.,4
great food quick service,5
good friendly & authentic,4
very good  and very helpful  cheerful  staff and lovely  food,5
good food with very fast service. a bit drab an plain inside with white walls and very little decor. could do with something to make it a bit more cosy and atmospheric. can't complain about the food and prices are what's expected for chinatown.,4
one of the oldest and best dim-sum resturants in london's chinatown.it can get very busy but usually does not require calling ahead unless you want to go on a sunday afternoon which is the traditional time many chinese have dim-sum.,4
great place for a group of ppl go for yum cha!,4
great food ! filled my whole family with foods worth 72 and had atleast 4 boxes for leftover takeaway! great atmosphere and the workers are friendly. the food tastes amazing and it is worth the price will come here again! recommened,5
gone down hill lots recenly . very expensive and horrible food .didn't see any chinese people there .caters for europeans now and food is not good,2
"food was ok, nothing outstanding. disgusting treatment of customers. we finished our dishes and i still had my entire coke left (i had it in my hand literally) waiter comes in and just says 'you're done with your meal goodbye' and starts taking away the table cloth. incredible. don't go here!",1
"good food, but staff was pretty cold ...  wouldn't visit again ... oh and they got me the wrong noodles ... ",3
good company and food,5
"ive eaten lunch at lido several times over several years and really like the foodparticularly seafood dishes , noodles and dim sum ... great value",1

terrible went here in the 80 s was a great place alas no longer  the food was tastless i have had better from a microwave meal avoid this place !,1
the lady at the door was super nice and friendly. but when we got inside the staff looked fed up and were rude. the portions are really small and the food did not taste great.,1

very good chinese food. lots of great vegetarian options. highly recommend the veggie set menu ,5
service was very friendly and the food was tasty,4

"cracking  you'll get seated were ever they can fit you. super food, super service and duper value",5
"probably the worst restaurant experience ive had. food is pretty standard but the ceiling started to leak mid way through our meal, with water falling into my beer and food...",1
"in a hurry to serve you, really poor salt and pepper squid. put a service charge on the bill, not marked up as a service charge, confused the final bill.",1
"very good food, very good service",5

on gerrards street so v busy. food was ok but too much of it.,3
great dim sum!,5
"fairly priced food! :) ginger onion lobster noodles were pretty good, seasonal vegetables were fresh. roast duck and charsiu were average. would come back for the friendly service, which can be quite rare for chinese restaurants at busy dinner times.",4
"it's so hard to choose a chinese restaurant in chinatown. this is a good choice. unusually friendly staff, good food and nice atmosphere. upstairs tables looked a bit pokey. service charge included on the bill which i prefer. we'll be back. ",4
not as good as 10 years ago. food has less taste than i expected.,3
very dated decor but the dim sum is second to none. well worth the visit,3
"best chinese food!!! in chinatown in london, excellent service",5
we had the very tasty vegetarian set meal.,5
lovely staff and good selection of dimsum. food comes out very quickly and plates are always cleared with a smile.,5
"great food , one of the best restaurants in chinatown .",5
"really good food, reasonable prices, a lot of option for the dishes. the place felt warm and welcoming.",4
a very british version of chinese food but if that is what you fancy it is well done. reasonably busy so worth booking if you are in a group.,4
"good, tasty food, fast service, deceptive pricing. dinner for three without drinks costs upwards of 50. receipt will be in chinese only and they will ask you for a tip over and above the mandatory 12,5% service charge..",3
rude waitressessemi-warm foodhigh price for low-budget food snd staff,1
best in chinatown,5
time and time again amazing dimsum,5
the best dim sum and food in general.  larger portions than others with much better taste.  not to mention a kitchen that opens late.  ,5
"quality of dim sum is pretty good, service can be a little hit and miss but in my experience much better than your average chinatown restaurant",4

authentic asian flavours in a pleasant dining environment. efficient and friendly staff.,4
good but not great,3
"food very good but pricey. also tables crammed very close so very little privacy. but is standard for central london. encouraging to see a recent five star hygiene certificate on their door, which is so rare in chinatown",3
excellent excellent food and service love this place,5
good food plus hygiene factor if 5 stars from the fda!,5
"good selection of dim sum, including rarer vegetarian options that can't be found in other chinatown spots. if you order a la carte, however, it's quite overpriced (as with the rest of chinatown), and i'm not convinced the food is all that special. the beef ho fun is good though. servers can be quite surly. ",3

"good food, thought the service was quite poor in terms of the waiter being quite rude. also a few of us arrived earlier than others and weren't allowed to sit at our table and had to wait, not sure what that was about.",3
always go here when in london.  they have the best dimsum and are really friendly.,5
"boring food, the aircondition was on, so it was quiet cold inside .. staff wasnt smiling except the lady in the street trying to get costumers.. and a bit pricy.. :(",1

"horrible quality, left after the starters and canceled the mains as the quality was that poor",1
"always excellent chinese food here, clean restaurant.",5
"great place, been going for years.",5
classic cantonese restaurant serving old school dim sum. consistency is the key to this place. *not many left in chinatown as they're being bulldozed and taken over by the pesky mainland chinese who serves anything but proper hong kong cuisine.,4
ok food. a bit haphazard service.,3
great food and service. friendly staff.,4

"food quality was just so-so as a chinese restaurant. the service was definitely bad and ignorance.  pay attention to the bill, check it before you pay",1
"extreamly bad restaurant, at first they hide the menu which they have at the main door and we have to ask for it. secondly they don't serve us which we asked for (2 different menus), they put in our table the dishes that they want and obviusly they dont put the expensives ones like prawns the give us the cheaper ones. ",1
ok when busy.,3
"good food, fast service, knowledgeable staff who could cope with my wife's intolerance of wheat and make helpful suggestions as to what would be good for her to eat. all done with a smile.",5
friendly and our table of 11 was well looked after,5
"very very good food! anyhow restaurant is not very clean, carpet is making horrible impression when you walking in. also tip is not optional and they are adding 12% to your bill. i found it very rude to force people to pay it, especially service wasn't that friendly. however as i said food is amazing!!",3
ordered dim sum as starter as well as mains.  food excellent and more reasonably priced than others.  been coming for decades.  recommended.,4
as always the food is good xx,5

nice food  but very annoying when they force you to pay a 12% service fee and refuse to take any other option. as a consequence of this i would not recommend this restaurant  service was okay but to speedy and with templates away before we have finished the course very keen to get us out,3
"distinctly average food, poor service - desperate to swipe away your dishes before you've even finished. bizarrely for a cold evening had cold air conditioning above the table which was most unwelcome.",2

"food wasn't as good as before and wasn't value for money. last time we has 10% discount if we paid cash, however this time we didn't get the discount. won't go this restaurant again!",1
very unfriendly. meal bad,1
lovely food,5
amazing food for my first chinese,4
delicious food. ask for the shanghai noodles. they are amazing.,4
the food is quite nice. the service is not very talkative to customers. they are rather distant. i would still come for the food.,4
"good, friendly, efficient service...excellent food and ample portions !",4
"food is ok, service is bad.....dont understand why must i pay for bad service??? this is included in the bill automatically. is there any possibility of not paying for bad service",1
"rude staff, really overpriced and mediocre food. literally better off getting tesco meal deal",1
one of the tastiest chinese restaurants in china town. fast and attentive service and delicious food. prices are reasonable. well definitely return.,5
tasteless dishes. very small portions. and unhelpful staff. i dont think more should be said,1
mediocre food. service was pretty ignorant and rushed.,3
average food at a semi reasonable price. not the best in chinatown but not the most expensive either. they have limited dim sum in the evening.,3
good value great food. nice atmosphere.  great place to eat before a show.,5
our favourite restaurant in chinatown. no trip to london is complete without a meal here.friendly staff and good food at a reasonable price...what more can you want,5
they wanted us out so quickly. the food was good.,3
first time here and we went there due to the large number of chinese diners!  food was tasty and reasonable price including alcohol.  glad we came here.,4
food was ok-ish. service was not. having waited 40 minutes for our main course we had lost our appetite and as such asked for the bill. they deducted 4 for not providing the mains! shocking treatment when they admitted they had got it wrong. would not recommend this place ever.,1
over priced. not friendly staff.,2
good food but we are regular and the bill was more as this week they putting service charge up by 10% i refused to pay as the service was not good on 2 occasions the waiter tried to clear the table while i was still eating. so after probably 25 years i won't be back,2
"in the heart of china town. had a table of 6. meals came quickly, were very tasty and big servings. tea was constantly topped up.",5
"the lido has been around for ages and is one of those spots that you end up in when you have tourist friends in town. tried their roasted duck set menu which was average compared to other restaurants in the area. the service is very mechanical which is fine, but doesn't do much to make a positive impression about the restaurant.",3
"lovely resturant in chinatown.8 of us had the set menus, food was tasty and the staff were quick to clear the table and bring the next course.",5
disorganised place. the food is good but my partner had to wait his dish more than 10 minutes after mine was served. poor portion of spring rolls (only 2!!!) and it came in the end! we had ordered all at the same time. poor service for the price.,2
"i couldn't fault the service or the food, although there was a small que, as a family we were seated reasonably quickly. we ordered from one of the set menus and the food was brought to the table, in good timing so you were never felt rushed, or had to wait long for the next course.",4
a dirty place smelling like mould. the food was good but  small portions and  nobody understand english .,1
"very good food, would recommend! set meal was really delicious.",5
"rude servers, mc donalds few blocks away offers better service and food",1
"awful experience, the food had the same flavor, every dishes were made with a sweet, too much sweet sauce in everywhere, plus the waiters were rude and it seemed they wanted to sent us always as quickly as possibile, even if the restaurant was not full at all. i would not recommend this place to a friend.",1
beautifully cooked food.,4
good food and quick service,4
had dim sum here and enjoyed every dish i had. think this could become a regular whenever i'm in chinatown.,5
"best for dim sum. noodle soup is fantastic and not salty at all. a must for a nice lunchtime chinese food. very clean and tidy, with air conditioning in the summer.",5
one of the best chinese restaurant in china town and soho,5
luvvly me o ok so china,5
"been coming here since 1979, it's changed a lot but food always good.",5
everything about lido is wonderfulfood atmosphere and service.prob ably my most favourite chineserestaurant in all of london and has been for many years,5
"food was cracking, staff attentive, very enjoyable.",5
"we had a perfect meal. staff were attentive,food was good ,wine excellent. we spent a couple of hours enjoying food .lovely",5
"cold plates,  rice dished up on these whilst still waiting for the rest of the dishes to be delivered to the table. waitress plonked a dish on the table without telling us what it was. service poor. it's a shame as the standards used to be very good. the place needs redecorating too, it is definitely looking tired.",2
very decent dim sum. quick and friendly service.,5
grear dim sum at reasonable prices,5
good service. good food,5
order the mixed meat and seafood crispy noodles!,3
"used to be good but not anymore, poor quality food and ridiculously expensive. never again.",1
"we always have great food here. not greasy or heavy like lots of knock off chinese places.  particularly liked the vegetarian roast duck, have never had anything like it!  the staff is friendly and attentive. would recommend.",4
been to this restaurant several times and food always good. disappointed to find a 20% festive surcharge which put a dampner on our visit,3
"roasted duck has too much fat to my liking, but the roasted pork belly is really good. their chinese dishes are also excellent. do come here for the good food but expect less on the service. :)",4
"we tasted the crispy duck and it is really very comparable to the last one we had in beijing. not fancy, reasonnable price for a good and tasty food, very well located in the heart of chinatown, it is worth its reputation.",4
"the duck is really very good here! however, this is the typical chinese fast food joint where terrible service is expected, so don't expect much from them! best for a take out if you don't want to deal with angry waiters.",4
"visited many times and therere mix of good and bad experiences. in rush hours just dont expect great customer service, they are likely to bring you the bill before you asked or even finished your food. the taste is ok if you know what to order.",3
chinese restaurant in china town london. food is very good and authentic.,5
this restaurant is not even worth one star. poor service (and have a look at the comment written by yiwen yang please) and i wonder how much msg they have added to the soup!,1
terrible roast duck and pork belly!,1
"cantonese restaurant that is perfect for big groups. the roasted duck, sweet and sour pork, fried rice and sour & spicy soup are recommended. most dishes are for sharing. do not expect impeccable service - they are known for their food but not service. this place is popular with locals and tourists.",4
food is very tasty! long queue thou. worth waiting.,4
couldnt accommodate to a sesame allergy,1
"unbelievable food, not expensive and the service is quick and kind. love it",5
"popular place among the asians who just visit or live in london. there are a lot of nice menu including barbecue pork, roasted duck and fried squid. the price is reasonable however you would not expect luxurious service. in addition, during the peak time you can expect long queue.",4
"exceptional food, fast and friendly service, and actually really reasonably priced, cannot recommend enough, especially for a group, though make sure you book in advance, especially weekends!",5
"overrated food. ordered a variety of dishes roast duck, morning glory,   beef and veg, pro ribs. service so so. pork ribs were dreadfully inedible- not fresh. do not serve dim sum.",3
to be honest the food is good but a particular bespectacled male waiter shouted at me for raising my hand to order my food and took my order in an extremely rude manner. was on the brink of walking out.. it spoiled my whole dining experience.,1
very good chinese restaurant in the londonian china town. roasted duck is a must,4
"ignore the appearance, food is excellent - try the slat and pepper ribs",4
good food and service.,4
"amazing duck, tasty food, and authentic. be sure to get here early as very busy and for good reason! one of the best chinese in china town.",5
the best cantonese goose around.,5
very tiny and busy and hurry you to leave!!!!,3
loved the duck and hot pot.fun meal for groups!,4
"best roast duck, pork in london china town, delicious southern chinese food, very popular, must try restaurant in london",4
"great food. nice vibe. cool area, being in china town - bit different. you feel like you've escaped the typical london scene. ",5
the service was terrible. the people there do not care about guest's reasonable.food is not that good.,1
lovely food.,4
"best duck ever!what a juicy duck skin, even better than any restaurant in hongkong!",5
food is good but staff there is rude. no interests of coming again.,5
"good isnt bad but not worth the price, paid more than 50 for two people. service is good and the place is busy",3
it's ok. food was good but far too expensive for the service and the decor. it is bang in central london which is what you end up paying for.,3
always too busy. staff more focus on business rather then customers. price affordable. ,4
food was lovely. not cheap but guess not used to london prices ,4
"good to have a meal in here, the opening time is quite longer than other branches.",4
my family and i went for a lovely day out to china town  we decided to have lunch and my word it was beyond amazing the customer service was perfect and so was the food id definitely go back.,5
decent food. the portions have got smaller and they do the dodgy 12.5% service charge included nonsense on the bill.,4
"come early if you don't want to wait! food was really delicious, especially the duck!staff are friendly but i felt there was a language barrier issue",4
love this place. popular amongst my chinese friends too.,4
"great meat, some of the best duck and roast pork ive had, however just a bit cramped inside as tables are so close together.",4
"it used to be good, now small portions",2
"superb. really excellent food. always busy but you can taste the reason for that! hot pot seems a speciality, but i didn't try it yet.",5
worst service ever i have experience in chinatown! they treat chinese people even worse. always rushing us to order super annoying. will never come again.,1
"for chinese food, perhaps one of the best in london.",5
the duck is excellent - but a restaurant of this calibre should train their staff better. i'd like them to explain the dishes properly to my non-chinese diners. politeness is key for repeat business!,4
nice little chinese restaurant in china town. tried the fried rice and hot pot and they were so nice. the duck was so good as well. would recommend to try this restaurant.,5
forgot to take pics until we were done,4
great food but the service is terrible...,3
(propably) the most famous dish roast duck.. the duck is a little lax. average level.,3
standard chinese food though slightly expensive. not very friendly service due to busy regime it has everyday. no advanced booking. first come first serve basis and be prepared to sit in narrow tables. do not recommend coming here in crowds bigger than 4 people.,3
cantonese cuisine. you can have an excellent meal or just a mediocre one. unpredictable. the service is the typical standard in chinatown,3
"good:gives out a free orange as dessertbad: with a compulsory >10% service charge which is not (clearly) shown on the menu outside. quite cunning.non-traditional ingredient. the barbecued sweet pork is cooked from a cheaper kind of meat, as opposed to the traditionally used part of pig, making it dry and hard.",3
"popular chinese restaurant, must try if visit china town. food are great",4
food was delicious and not expensive.,4
"tastes just like home. i highly recommend their roasted duck, a must try",5
was highly recommend by some thai friends however there was not much room and the food was sub par.,2
"best char siu in london. exceptional crispy noodles with beef and black bean sauce too. only 4 stars because the waiters are probably the rudest on the planet, i'll give them some slack though as the food is great",4
best cantonese roast duck ive ever had hands down.,5
tables are a bit small but the food was great.,5
generally rude receptionist. unfriendly and lie.,1
expensive for the quality of food. dishes are small and some came out lukewarm. the rice is the biggest trap at 3.2 quid per person. service also needs improvement. we weren't greeted and had to try several times to flag down servers for menus and orders.,1
expensive and mediocre service for 12.5% service charge!,3
excellent and authentic food in the heart of chinatown.,5
rubbish service !,1
"service was good, food comes quickly and they speak english. one dish was really good, rice noodles with beef. the other, fried noodles with shrimp was not so good. spring rolls are really small, don't order.",3
a little too much sauce on their bbq items.  made it too sweet.  had better and worse.,3
"best duck on rice in town, esp when they take off the bone. terrible service though. other dishes not good. ",3
closed at 22:30 on wed. please update correct hours.,1
"lukewarm, bog standard chinese food.",2
"excellent food.  good price. crap customer service though, but serve fast.",5
"delicious asian-approved duck, portions were a little small though, and most of the other dishes were severely overpriced.",4
"best authentic chinese restaurant in china town, was brought here by a chinese colleague and we now come back once a month for a feast!",5
"lovely food, reasonably priced. staff were friendly but we did get the feeling of being rushed through our meal. ",3
good food but pricey,4
we ordered pepper crab to go and the taste was amazing! crab is massive and only cost 20!  will definitely go again!,4
"crispy duck not crispy at all. went there because everyone is saying that it is worth a try. well, not again. never ever go there anymore. disappointed.",1
"if you miss a typical good cantonese roast duck or pork, this place would be a good visit. there is a ""little four seasons"" next door whose food i find to be less tasty.",3
"a little on the pricey side for chinese food, especially given the local competition. this place is particularly famous for the duck. ",3
nice food but waiter especially take away are extremely rude.,3
"the most horrible service and food i have ever eaten in my 43 years of my lifewaiters all rude, food so-so. some dish i ordered never came and yet the waitress dared to stare at me as if i owe her money",1
good place for authentic roast meats. busy place.,4
what cheats - paid for half a duck take away and this is what i got! this is more like a quarter!!! wheres the wing and leg?!,1
unique hot pot place for winter days!,5
best chinese in chinatown for grilled meats. the hotpots are pretty good too.,4
not as good as i remembered,3
"the food was okay, but nothing more",3
"cozy chinese restaurant, reasonable prices. very good noodles dishes, i totally recommend the singapore noodles. duck was also delicious",4
a very good place with great portion of food. is worthy for tasting.,4
i love the hotpot!,4
roast dishes here are the best in town! service is absolutely horrendous so i would recommend taking out instead of eating there! tables are cramped and some waiters shout at you and throw you the bill even before you're done eating! ,3
nice foods and fair price. service wasn't perfect but just fine,4
staff were rude and the food wasn't all that. place was really crammed downstairs. had to switch seats a few times. would not recommend ,2
"a nice place to enjoy their famous chicken, duck or pork with crispy skin",4
"the food was served cold and too quickly for me to believe it was fresh. the sweetcorn soup was tasteless. i also had the 3 barbecued meats on rice and i didn't see anything special in the duck, though the portion was generous. had some way better chinese food in other restaurants around.",2
their roast duck is lovely. the melt basically melts in your mouth. not to mention the tasty crisp skin...indulgence.,5
enjoyed night out with my friends. delicious meal,5
"supposedly famous for its crispy roast duck and crispy pork belly.  they are ok and might find other restaurant that do them better.  it is always busy,  over crowded table arrangements, interior need a long overdue upgrade work.  ",2
"this is a horrible place to enjoy china town. always prompting you to eat quickly, staff is eager to take your table away if all your friends are not there on time. avoid.",1
"peking duck was succulent. one duck is enough for four people. kailan vegetable dish was also very good. we will definitely be back to try their other roasts. the only downside is that it's crammed and little messy, but that is typical of most chinese restaurants in chinatown.",4
nice food. quick service. roast pork was the highlight.,4
"roast duck is very good!  roast meat,  especially the crispy one, is good tool.  still maintain that ""authentic"" taste, unlike many other ""westernized"" chinese food!  derive is not bad too!",4
"well, the waitress here has a very bad service and attitude and even make a bad comment on our payment method. i have to say it is our right to choose to use money or card, ok? very terrible experience and wont go this place any more! disgusted attitude and service!",1
"tried the crispy prawn ball specials ,6 tiny prawn balls for 13.9 , not special and rip off. bbq is ok, braised tofu poor and tasteless. maybe other chinese are better.",1
good place to eat china food,4
"great roast duck; it's pretty much the only thing i come for. the roast meats are also pretty good but some of the other dishes can be average. efficient service, but not expect it to be the friendliest.",4
the best roast duck in the world.,5
"the hotpot was very flavourful. the noodles felt more like instant, however. average atmosphere and decor.",3
"although i waited long time for my taking away grilled duck rice, the waiting is totally worthy!",5
food is generally nice. duck is pretty good here. atmosphere not impressive though.,4
restaurant 'four seasons' in london's chinatown has the best roast duck cantonese style (i prefer it on the bone) in the world according to the financial times. i agree.,5
very nice place for eat in london. duck is the one very frever in this place.,5
"despite its reputation as the best chinese restaurant for duck in london i though it was nothing special. food, decor and service are just average for chinatown.",3
"poor food, dirty toilet, cold service.",2
"duck is alright, and its a good place to experience some hong kong style table service",4
"poor service, very rude. the waiter took the menu away while i was still looking at the food when ordering. ridiculous! gave us very little time to order, very impatient. do not recommend this place! no respect to customers. ",1
beautiful food very friendly staff had a lovely experience will return highly recomend ,5
"four seasons has to make some of the best roast duck in china town. highly recommended. its a bit cramped, staff could be more friendly. service and meal can feel a bit rushed. but if you just come here for food, it's can be forgiven.",4
love the duck here even if places in queensway are better,5
the food is quite good but the service is rude expensive,3
very very tasty. the roast duck is tasty. the soup is tasty too.,5
wow.. food is exceptional.. true chinese cuisine.. love love love it.,5
amazing roast duck. crowded.,5
"char siu and roast duck are always tasty here. if i ever need to eat a chinese meal and want to feel satisfied after, i come here.",4
"place seems really authentic, we were basically the only non chinese people there. service was really poor though, and food though tasty was not that warm. it's a shame as could be a really good place but the unfriendly staff is off-putting.",2
good duck. there are 2 doors. one for quick meal and the other a restaurant. ,4
great food and customer service!,4
"started promisingly, but service was very poor after more tables were seated. duck was cold and soggy and the replacement never arrived. avoid.",1
came here for the duck. absolutely delicious. there's often a long queue of eager punters and tourists waiting for the duck.,4
very good and authentic chinese food,5
dinning place with chinese cuisine.,3
great food. service can be questionable but that's the charm of eating here. recommend the duck.,4
good food and atmosphere,4
good food. very popular so have a waiting time before being seated but worth the wait.,4
four seasons used to be known for its good quality roast duck. don't go there - a bunch of bones for 15  this place is s tip off,1
"it really is ok. nothing special, not bad either.",3
the best chinese food you can get in town.,5
overall nice place with a good food. we less like the attribute.,4
very bad service. not recommended at all,1
the duck and tofu were great and the staff were friendly.,4
one of the best tofu in london.,5
great food and service. highly recommended the pork stomach and chicken hotpot. it sounded strange to me but was fantastic... glad i tried! good price. 2 of us with 3 dishes below 40,5
very good quality food. one of the best chinese restaurants i ever visited.,5
all the service below charge 7.11 pounds,1
great place to have the best roast duck. apart from that nothing else to mention in good terms. service is a joke. chinese get the best treatment,2
crispy duck is good so delicious,5
"the roast duck too fattening! the cut is bad, too huge a piece! worst is their white rice, so cold and it seems like overnight rice... be frank the roasted duck tasted quite good just the cut is bad. other dishes are alright.",2
good choice for cantonese dishes and amazing  (pork tripe chicken stew),4
good food.,4
"came here feeling hungry and excited but left feeling like id been robbed. very expensive! food isnt that great. the satay sauce was awful, thai style chicken had no thai flavour at all and the roasted bbq pork was not tender or as tasty as ive had in other chinese restaurants. overall i was disappointed.",2
"as others mention, you should probably order a whole crispy duck, which is a huge meal for two or a main course for three. it's what they're famous for. hands down best i've tasted in london. service is verrrry brisk, even for chinatown, but not pushy. prices are reasonable. definite recommend.",5
just the same as every four seasons. can get crowded.,3
"their dumplings are sublime. i thoroughly enjoyed all the food i had here, and the tea is lovely too. service was quick, but no staff spoke to us really; they just showed up to take our order, but we didn't mind as it felt more casual that way.",4
"very nice dishes, but waitress are in a hurry...",3
"tried the most famous - pork stomach with chicken hot pot, very good! the only prob is that queue is always very long at peak time.",4
"amazing traditional british-chinese, big on portions and taste!",5
a great place for chinese food and tim sum,5
disgusting fly in the soup. highly not recommend to go. the service is extremely poor and the portion is small. not worthy of money at all,1
"good food in a very authentic place. the atmosphere is not great, staff is not really nice but the food is very tasty and well prepared. the very vast majority of the customers is asian; to me it is the best proof that the food is authentic and good. i recommend this place",4
delicious food and staff were friendly to us. really good roast meats and sweet and sour dishes,5
"overpriced food, some of it not made fresh just reheated in microwave. slow service. they forgot our rice, couldn't start eating for at least 5 minutes. 12% service charge added to bill despite not having it displayed in advance anywhere.",1
"food here is so good, it makes the somewhat transactional service and the often long queue worth it.their duck is exceptional.",5
one of my favourite resturant too. especially their crispy pork. highly recommended,5
"the service was absolutely shocking (from the door staff and the waiter). the menu is not clear and the food is ok, although our dishes arrived 10 minutes apart.",1
how this place is regarded as only 3.6 is scandalous!! this is by far the best chinese restaurant i have ever been to in the whole of europe!!,5
the bbq meats are nice. service is good.  my advice is to book to avoid the queue which is hard to justify the wait outside,4
"excelent food, reasonable price, could improve the service",4
"the food was not bad actually. the duck was a bit dry but chicken and beef dishes were nice. the french beans on the side were really good.however, service is not great in this place. staff is rather rude and pushes you around.it's also rather pricey and i think you're better off with some of the take away options around.",2
"the deep fried duck was the only option because i came in a party of 2. hot and sour soup and mapo tofu wasnt great. but it was the closet thing we can get from home. overall, decent experience, decent food and great waitress services. slightly pricey.",4
absolutely outrageous service.. no consideration for customers. a little chinese club where queueing doesn't mean anything.. food is good to be fair but not worth giving them your hard earned cash.. loads of other chinese places as good around here. and as my italian companion say: simpatici come un bacco in culo..,1
5 star all for their roast duck. always go there and order it. other dishes are average but the duck is just outstanding and even better than what i had in hong kong.,5
"great chinese in the heart of china town, food is fantastic and value for money.",5
"staff friendly and welcoming, food is delicious and you definitely get what pay for, will definitely recommend this restaurant. will definitely be back. been quite long since i've had tasty chinese food.",4
"food was not bad , the service awfully bad and the staff is horrible. never smile and showing attitude.",1
"the duck was good. and so was the service. the lady serving us was warm and welcoming too. however, the rice for 4 of us costs almost as much as the 1/2 duck we had.",5
"the noodles are okay, everything else was disappointing and overpriced. very very rude staff. will never go back",1
"roast duck is probably your best bet here.everything else is fairly standard chinese restaurant fare. none of it was bad, but all pretty average. about the same standard as the rest of the street.",4
good service and nice food,5
great chinese - reasonably priced - huge portions,5
the roasted duck is not as good as it used to be. i heard that they changed the chef.,3
"famous chinese restaurant. recommended for roasted duck, pork and chicken ",5
"best roast duck ive had, even compared with asia. those who rate low just arent used to chinese standard of service. in chinese culture its more about the food, not the niceties of service and looks. heavily underrated, should be a 3.9.",5
"this is a really good chinese restaurant. friendly staff, tasty food, good portion.",4
"quality of the food has gone down, prices gone up....and felt pressured to eat and get out quickly. was one of our favourite places, but we won't be returning",2
"go every year on my trip to london,beautiful food and very pleasant staff.",5
"food is good, poor service waiters don't care",3
pretty good roast duck. also tried  the braised beef noodles. generous serving. place is crowded so go early.,4
the duck is awesome. the cantonese duck is highly recommended.,5
a friend of ours recommended this place so why not! must try the boneless duck! only thing i didn't like is that they hover way too much as if they want to make sure you're out when you're not eating anymore.,5
known for its duck and rice. would recommend.,5
"lovely meal, good service and friendly staff",4
"duck and pork belly were the star dishes. the rest were just alright. service was meh and slow, except when it comes to the bill.",3
"very rude staff. charge for us 5 service, but i dont think they deserve it. poor service",1
sensational duck. wonderful crab. a solid chinese eating place. busy and popular. service was good for a chi ese restaurant. getting the bill was not a hassle. they were prompt.,4
"note to the waiter guy today in the white shirt, at 12pm (2nd jan 2019). if you have a runny nose and need to use a tissue, thats fine. but dont use it, get your fingers right in there, and then.... proceed to serve people food!! without washing your hands !!!! dirty!!!",1
the hotpot - pork stomach and chicken in black pepper broth is a must have here. make sure you get there early to avoid the queue.,5
"we are three frieds visiting london. we enjoyed the meal which was  extremely good, the service was very polite and professionnal. i recommend the place. thanks very much",5
ok but needs a bit of a clean!,3
food was alright but took too long to come out. people that ordered after us got their food way before us. staff are pretty rude.,1
good cantonese duck!,3
"food is great (roast duck and noodle dishes) but service is very rushed and lets the place down. staff are very eager to rush you and show no emotion, just try and get you in and out as soon as possible. don't come here for the service",4
"totally overpriced for their food. charge $4 for a bowl of white rice! and service is so so and other than the duck, i wont even be back for it. goldmine definitely better",2
duck is amazing. worth queueing for!,5
took my mum here for her birthday after a trip to watch motown years back. we now go atleast once a year. absolutely amazing. great prices and great service. must visit!,5
"good roast duck, but unfortunately they were understaffed. waited long to order and to get the bill.",3
a place with normal food. just order the roasted meats and youre good.,2
"soup is rich, chicken is tender but slightly lacking in flavour. nice fujian fried rice and veg. however, service was very poor and slow. we had to get up to call for service while they hid behind the counter on their phones.",3
"food was tasty as always, 4/5 because we had to wait 10mins after sitting down to be served.",4
waiters and waitresses are pretty rude but the food is tasty. cost of the meal came up to ~80 for 4 adults and 3 children which is pretty good value considering we were all stuffed afterward.,4
"although the duck was one of the best i have had so far, the rest of the food was rather disappointing, the service bad and the food overprices. you can eat much better for a cheaper price. i would not recommend this restaurant.",2
great hot pot dish. fast and kind service as well.,5
if you want traditional cantonese then this is wonderful. chilli crab and spicy chicken to die for. if you want your local chinese takeaway this may not be for you. if you like good food and honest straightforward service. this is for you.i loved it and will be visiting again!,5
"this is probably my best chinese restaurant in  chinatown, but they automatically charge 12 percent service without telling you in the first place. not good. will think twice next time",1
poor service! wont go there again!,1
delicious food and a good selection of dishes on offer.,5
"nice chinese food. good service, prices, clean space and a perfect location. duck, soups and noodles are some of the best dishes i ever tasted in london.",5
"we booked a table for 8 before new year, it was very busy. the food is amazing! portion is good, service can be improved!",5
we didnt enjoy the food: sweet&sour chicken was too sweet; chicken with black bean sauce was way too salty. they seem to treat chinese customers with more attention and treats at the end of the meal.,1
"such good quality food. really pleasant service. fast arrival of tasty food. we had very good salt and pepper squid, and excellent crispy beef, actually it was all superb quality, and flavour. highly recommended.",5
"overpriced.service is really bad,no juke . paid 6.7 gbp service fee for a 57.1 gbp meal just to be ignored",1
decent chinese food. good place late since it was open till 12 or so and still serving food. service could be better but i dont mind it. we got what we wanted.,4
very nicei like it,5
lunch on ny day today. friendly folk and great food.,5
"we were a group of five the duck was good, pork char sui excellent, i loved the pak choi and the wok fried noodles had a natural smokiness. the only let down was the fried dim sum.",5
come here for the duck but not for the service,3
more famous for its hotpots compared to its chain store next door. it still has a few signature dishes from next door. almost always a queue on weekends,5
good food and service. always there's queue.,4
food was great. the service was good. the waitress was really nice and adorable.,5
"great food, great value, and served in an authentic chinese restaurant",5
watch out when paying your bill as they added 24 to my bill by so called mistake,1
"appallingly rude staff. having eaten here several times before, i queued in the rain, at a busy time, on my own for 40 mins to be told when i reached the top that i they wouldnt serve a table for one. the manager shouted not today! at me. one suspects it may be somewhat race driven too. a shame because the food is rather tasty.",1
the food is good but the staff sucks and they are really rude. they barely speaks english.,4
very authentic korean food. customer service is way better than some other restaurants in china town. must visit !,5
"too expensive. 2,80 for a small bowl of rice",2
service is bad. food is ok. price too high. not recommended. ,1
"very small portions, dont go if youre hungry. pancakes are good, anyway.",2
excellent food and pricing for a korean restaurant in central london.,5
fantastic food and service,5
"nice place, slightly overpriced for what they offer. ",4
tasty consistent korean cuisine! london prices but worth it..,5
soft tofu soup is nice ,4
food is really good however it's a little overpriced. overall good service and food.,4
good authentic food for not too much money. a little gem. ,4
korean chicken is aaammaaaaazzziinnggg,5
service was horrible :( staff are un-friendly and rude. go somewhere else,1
quick service ,4
service badand the food is just good,1
smile first ^^,4
"rude staff. i called up to see if it was at all possible to reserve a table and the lady over the phone shouted ""first come first serve"" then hung up. i called again and the lady said ""stop calling we busy at the moment"". er sure, way to keep your customers!",1
"food was ok, though it was a bit pricey. restaurant was cosy. service was a bit slow but i didn't find the staff as rude as many of the other reviewers say, maybe i was lucky. ",3
a bit pricey but ok. expected more.,3
very expensive place. foods are tasty and delicious but they charge you too much for the amount they are serving. ,3
ever since the recent change of management the service has improved significantly and the spicy chicken wings are fantastic.,4
"their general attitude was terrible. arrogant and rude ""manager"" put us off even ordering from here. stay away... they were ridiculing us due to a little misunderstanding whilst we were sat down, unbeknownst to them i am a native speaker... they should take down the flag outside before they give us a bad name.",1
truly a great place for authentic korean food that i love and enjoy not just their food but their people for their outstanding efforts in all they do to king and country,5
"very rude staff and bad service. food is the way expensive. wouldn't recommend to friends. other than that, a waitress has forced us to order meals which are more than we need.",1
feel bad whenever passing by. they could have done better.,1
"quite average. we went in seeing a lot of asians inside, but that apparently is no guarantee for quality. i had tempura which was done very well, but the chicken i ordered had very little to do with chicken. service was friendly. bit overpriced.",3
go to yori which u only need to walk 5min more. this place is rubbish. manager with arrogant attitude pissed me off and even tho they r asians they act like racists towards asians lol,1
i always love going back 2 this place. can't get enough.,5
"the tuk bok ki i had came with a sauce that was too watery and not spicy enough.i also had some cuttlefish that was too salty to eat.service was ok, but they refused to give tap water.",2
very awful customer service. do not recommend!!,1
amazing food. you have to go try it.,5
"giant portions - we had a bibimbap each and a pancake to share and could barely finish. very delicious food too, and the staff were friendly and service relatively brisk,",4
it was ok. rude staff though,3
this place was too good...... 1 grain of rice was 10 pound....#worth........... they charged me for going to the toilet #worth,5
the food is very nice! however the waiters are not. no smiles on their face! ,3
too expensive and food didn't taste great or fresh apart from korean chilli chicken. not much of a side dishes aswell. would not recommend. ,1
good korean food the bim bam bap hit the spot.,4
"service need to be improved, not happy with their attitude",2
"terrible. for one, their 'salad' consisted just of lettuce and mayo. toilets disgusting. ",1
double fried korean chicken. just try it. honestly everything we tried was phenomenal.,5
"amazing food, good service.",5
"authentic korean food. i tried kimchi-jjigae, it was super hot, so now you are warned.",5
"not value for money! the food was good, especially korean style fried chicken. liked maki with prawns, but i believe it is very pricy for what it is. amount of korean appetisers was very tiny as well. did not like green tea. service charge 12,5%",3
"service was bad. fried chicken is good but the kimchi pancake we ordered was bad and too pricey for what we get. too much batter too little kimchi middle part wasnt cooked , kimchi fried rice taste very bad too. could only taste the burnt part. please dont try unless you want to be disappointed.",1
good korean experience,4
"overpriced and not even nice. the ""ginseng"" chicken soup was msg and chicken. the owners are korean so it came as a surprise that they chose to use msg for the soup.",1
"the only thing korean here is the name. absolutely awful and very expensive.the food is more chinese than korean, and if the food isnt bad enough there is a brothel above it.",1
the food and the staff are amazing,5
"very friendly staff, very good food! thank you!",5
very expensive and nasty salty food,1
"we were hungry, went there, staffs were nice, served us faster. food was good. the only issue was gratuity was included 6 was added forcibly. we order just a main course, hot beverage, and one dessert for tips to be that high. it's not like a english thing to do in the uk.",4
"very, very overpriced for the quality they provide. service was slow and kept us waiting for tap water despite constantly reminding each other to bring it (never received it though). 5 for a handful of cold spinach and the place wasn't clean. avoid.",2
amazing place.great food.,5
"low quality, medium level prices, doesn't worth it",3
terrible place to eat at. dont waste your money and time.,1
"good taste, seems like authintic korean food, in taste and look.",4
best korean restaurant in london,5
"apparently ordering 12.5 of appetizers isn't fine, but ordering 7.5 of main dishes is. you must order a main dish. also it's very expensive. i got the sushi and it just wasn't good. you're also going to pay 12.5% gratuity on an already incredibly expensive menu. not recommended.",1
tasteless ginseng chicken. rice half cook. fried chicken is a bit dry inside. bibimbap was ok.,2
"quick pleasant service but food quality is not the best, the fish we ordered wasnt fresh..",1
"rude, impolite staff. like talking to a brick.",1
very taste enjoy,4
"the worst restaurant in london ever, the fish wasn't good and probably neither fresh!",1
"nice food but extremely rude staff, these girls are the worst waitress i've ever seen in my life.",2
amazing food,5
korean restaurant - nepalese chef,1

rubbish ,1
they serve big dishes and for reasonable prices. very welcoming staff. great work.,5
superb food (best chicken ever) and nice personnel,5
don't advertise on deliveroo if you won't accept orders,1
the chicken was delicious and the staff were very friendly.,5
not bad. the quantity was quite large. every one can definitely get full there.,3
the food was great due to the taste and it's quality. the food satisfies you without making you feel bloated.,5
love it here. would recommend to visitors and locals alike.,5
customer service and food was way better than other korean restaurants in london. staffs were quick and friendly to all customers.  highly recommend bibimbab and kimchi soup!!,5
best chicken portions and price for two! plus  jampong is great.,5
i have been going there for many years as the food is fantastic! never got disappointed so far :) love restaurant owners as well! they are very nice and really care about the customers.,5
great food at reasonable prices. friendly service.,5
delicious and the staff is super friendly!! after many years i never spotted this place for some reason but we finally decided to give it a go and we loved it! thanks for the staff that was very helpful in giving advice on the options.,5
amazing food much better than expected given it's location in a tourist hotspot.excellent friendly and helpful service from all staff too!,5
"nice little korean restaurant, food is really delicious",5
very good,5
small cosy spot but terrible and overpriced food. should have just had a green tea.,1
"the restaurant used to be one of my favourites a few years ago, but changed their recipes a few times and not keeping the standard. the ginseng chicken soup, for example, while the soup being very hot, the chicken within is cold inside, and tasteless. quite disappointing.",2
"good place, nice music, nice food, a bot experience tho",3
"popped in for a quick dinner with my boyfriend. the place is very small so if you think you can have a private conversation, you will be disappointed. however the food was really nice and staff friendly so i would recommend going there for a taste of korea.",4
"very cute, authentic and tasty ",5
overpriced mediocre food.,1
i have to give all the stars i went with my friend and my 2 kids one with sp needs so he can be over the top i gave the staff a heads up but they were polite and helpful food went down well with 2 fussy eaters and all 4 new to the style of cooking (&taste) kids want to go back,5
"good food and good customer service, certainly we'll come back next year too. <3#btsarmyeverywhere",5
ginseng chicken soup doesnt worth 18 at all. its very oily and taste like msg. the rice in pork bibimbab is very soggy and there are barely any meat. do not recommend,1
it quite nice tasty of korea food. i like the fired chicken wing with korea source. but other is normal and fair price.,4
exelent food and treatment....lovely restaurant,5
"very nice food, excellent service. portions are much larger than they look in the menu.",4
"i just went to this place today as i was strolling through chinatown. food is not good, very very overpriced, stingy menu (have to order rice separately for 3 pounds #lol), bad service, and tips were included in the bill which i def didnt think they deserved to get. i will never go back to this place.",1
went with my girlfriend and we loved it,5
"food is average and over priced for the quality,plus has to pay 12.5 % service fee which doesn't exist at all. definitely not recommend and will not go back again.",1
"frozen meat for the bbq and had to pay extra to get lettuce. that said, the service was quick and the food was good. they have a nice variety of korean and japanese dishes. the staff was friendly and, overall, we had a great time.",4
love fried chicken,5
"absolutely awful. the kan poongi was the worst i've ever had. is trouble cuts of chicken, dipped in gelatin and then batter. i wouldn't give it to my dog. barely any of the servers are korean so don't expect any empathy when you're shocked that you have to pay for rice or kimchee.won't ever go here again.",1
quite expensive and doesnt taste good especially with the rice. the noodles soups are alright but it is still disappointing.,1
"very quick service, excellent food, really cool and quaint setting.... staff are friendly and quick..... and i got two water",5
very nice food. the only issue is that the vegetarian menu is very limited. it would be nice to include a veggy bibambap.,4
food is fresh and tastes really good. you can go there for traditional korean or japanese dishes and korean hot pot. the staff is nice and friendly.,4
very good food and friendly staff. min.20 for debit/credit cards. the seafood pancakes are delicious.,5
very good food and quick service,4
i always love coming here. the food has never disappoint me. a very fair mix of japanese and korean food that's all so tasteful and filling. highly recommend coming here alone or in groups.,5
very good food and staff were really friendly. a little on the expensive side in comparison to the other restaurants around the same area,4
"staff were friendly, food was delicious and the portion was quite decent! but the service charge was pretty much compulsory even though it said it wasn't",5
small portion according to price paid there are better korean restaurant's but in france,3
nicely done korean food.,4
worst korean restaurant i've ever been. food was over priced + 12.5 % service charge. if you want to drain your money from your bank then go there. will never ever go there again ,1
"food is big portion, beef is a bit dry.",3
food is awful. i ordered korean bbq and they serve me frozen meat. no taste as everything was bland. paid 100 for 2 people so not worth the money. please avoid this restaurant. owner is lovely though,1
"pricy and bad service, food is very average",1
"food is very pricey here, nothing special in my opinion. at the time a lot of other places were packed so i thought i would give this place a try, there's a reason why this place wasn't packed.",3
always great food here and attentive service,5
too expensive,1
"the foods are overpriced for what they offer. the staff was seem to not happy when customer come, no greeting at al. avoid",1
"very nice foood, nice boss as well",5
"the pork belly was like over cooked, or they cooked it several hours before. i couldnt even chew it. bad experience. never recommend.",1
"suffered food poisoning from this place (only meal eaten in the day then violently sick shortly after) really disappointed with this korean restaurant. dishes eaten: beef, kimchi pancake, green tea.",1
"my kimchi and pork soup was only kimchi, no meat in sight... too expensive for what it was. ",1
nice food but not with a smile,3
best korean restaurant in london. clean small peaceful haven in china town. the second we walked in the door all was good in the world. service was kind and food came quickly. the food was abundant and delicious. we had kimchi pancakes chicken banban chicken udon soup beef boulgari.  all excellant. two can easily share a serving,5
good korean restaurant if you're craving for korean dishes they have large selection of items. great place to go if you are hungry large portions. this is real korean.,4
great place in soho. delicious korean food and good staff. food is a bit pricey but no complaints here!,4
"perfect! really good food, service super nice! i will comeback for sure! ",5
nice korean food ,5
"london prices; food is delicious; too much meat stuff (but i think korean food is, anyway), so the choice is limited for non-meat eaters or muslims, like me (:-)).",4
not authentic korean cuisines. even the basic kimchi was disappointing.,1
okay place for lunch and groups - no raw egg on my bibimbap,3
"food is okay, customer service isn't bad but isn't good either. everytime i eat here i just felt like that they just want me to finish my food quick & leave asap hahaha & they win on that cause i leave as soon as i finish my food nowadays. cause they make me feel so uncomfortable. :)",3
i can't agree with the many one star reviews here.  solid food and unfussy service. the lunch menu is excellent value.this restaurant represents the front line in a war against the synthetic corporate borg on the south edge of lisle street.  ,4
their food used to be pretty good and traditional. recently the food quality dropped a lot. wont go there anymore.,2
it's nice asian food i am customer since 2008 :-) the price is bit salted but the food still taste and fresh...it's a good choice for local people :-),4
"always a great friendly experience & lots to choose from. free side dishes. but soju is only by the jugs, not glasses. ",5
really good vegan friendly option in chinatown - the deep fried tofu starter is amazing! friendly service and complimentary kimchi. my friend ordered the pork and kimchi soup and said it was sublime.,5
i ve tried better but seemed quite authentic considering only asians were eating here.,3
tasteless hot pot. disappointing.,2
for korean food in soho,4
worst korean i have ever had. the dish looks nothing like the thing on the menu. very expensive compared to other korean restaurants too. avoid!!!,1
the best korean restaurant in london with amazing customer service and amazing food at a good price :),5
very good food great choice authentic fantastic service.,5
nice korean food at a good price with good variety,4
incredibly rude service and bad food. i would never go there again. you can see some of the five star reviews here are just management rebuttals belittling their patrons feedback and telling them to grow up. i expect the same thing to follow my review to keep their rating at a mediocre 3. no way to run a business. ,1
edamame was not soft a bit hard and under cooked. toufu soup taste was bland. ,1
the sushi was fresh and delicious,5
"food very tasty, came quickly, staff very sweet and attentive. good range of dishes, good value.",5
"very nice korean food. taste is similar as what i used to have in korea. thank u for bring in to london. have only try korean food, the japanese food was not my interest. spicy pork is really nice. kimchi is not free as what offer in korea. will come again when in london",5
"the food is good, but it is a bit expensive. the staff was nice and the place has improved over the years, but with improvements the prices have increased. also they now offer some japanese dishes. ",3
"tasty food, got there just before it got busy- recommend not getting there at peak time unless you're willing to wait. nice, helpful staff and decent prices.",4
"this is my third time of going and i really enjoy it .if you like chinese ,you will love this !it's similar but fresher tasting and less oily .love their food choices and the idea that they have a different view on food ;see it as  medicine .",5
friendly service,5
tiny place. typical.good portions and very good food. got there a little bit late (about 11pm) but they waited for our order.nice service and not very expensive.i recommand.,4
great place. great food and at a reasonable price. worth a visit.,5
small restaurant with great typical korean food. prices are average for the area and the food is delicious. be aware that korean food is usually spicy and ask for advice to the waiter or waitress about what you are going to have. ,4
nice food and good environment. all in all you can't go wrong,5
great food. friendly service. a little gem of a place,5
good for when you are in chinatown but want something a bit different.,4
scrumptious options but a bit costly.,4
"i ate worst  in my whole life. i can cook better than the chef in this restaurant. taste nothing. also,  is worse than the instant you can buy in korean grocery. ",1
"i remember this being my favourite restaurant when i was in my early teens.more recently, it hasn't quite lived up to my memories but the food is still delicious and there is a lot of variety to choose from. comfortable atmosphere and friendly staff.would recommend.",4
waiting at the table 15 minute for someone to come and get order. food is too salty and horrible. seafood is not fresh at all. we don't  eat and they don't even bother to ask how was the food. waiter just give us the bill. really bad customer service. what a shame of charge 10% customer service. never go there again.,1
good taste!,5
will come again nice food.,5
"definitely try the spicy korean fried chicken, it is amazing",4
great food and attentive service...highly recommend..,5
so yummy foods. loved the cosy env.,5
fantastic food. so pleased we came here. will visit again.,5
"foods were great! i specially liked the bibimbab. i came here often wit my friends and family. i loved it there and their foods. however, some of the staffs were quite rude and one of them was a guy who work there and seem to have an arrogant attitude.",4
"the food was ok, but the staffs were extremely rude. i never saw any ruder staffs in my life. strongly not recommended.",1
"so we ordered the unlimited hotpot, and this place refused to serve us more food when they thought we ate too much. terrible service, will never come back",1
horrible service with very impatient staff. the ingredients were not fresh and the hot pot didn't taste good either. won't recommend it if you want something local. ,1
"good food, but the experience is what makes this place great. you'll get a boiling bowl of broth and you select raw ingredients to cook in it at your table. staff is friendly and welcoming to newbies by making recommendations. ",5
"we always love a good chinese hot pot. little lamb does one of the best chinese hotpots there is. unlimited food. friendly staff, good atmosphere. not too expensive. fast service.",5
i do not reccomend. trust me go olle for korean bbq and hot pot super yummy. this resturant is a joke!,1
"great chinese hotpot restaurant. attentive staff,great selection of meats, fish and vegetables.",5
"watch out for the extra fees , dipping sauce not included, service subpar would forget our orders several times, try somewhere else",3
the waitstaff were prompt and friendly. the quality of the food was good. we came for the 26 (+service fee) all you can eat. we thought it was a fair price.,4
"if you rate this for more than 3 stars, it means you really need to experience hot pot dining more, even in china town. price, service, quality of food, none was satisfactory.",1
"amazing food and attentive staff. really love the concept. they have a great selection of fresh meat, fish and veg. if youre find yourself in the area and want to try something new, you wont be disappointed.i will definitely will go back.",5
good hotpot specialist!,4
"the food are so expensive compare to other similar hotpot!!! the all u can eat plan have many choice of food, the taste is fine. but the portions are small, and many popular food cost extra!  not recommended!",2
"what a tasty treat!  if you weren't looking for it you would miss it...and miss some very tasty hotpot.  they had a variety of meats, vegetables and broth.  all in all a very good meal for a reasonable price!",5
great,4
"the food is very good with an affordable price, they are served very quickly once the order has been placed even when it's busy. the service here is good, the waiters are very polite  which made the experience very pleasant. would definitely recommend for people who want to experience traditional chinese hotpot",5
"food was average and worth a visit if you fancy hot pot, however there are other options nearby for better quality. you have to pay for sauce's where others offer for free with your meal too.",2
so bad servicevery expensive and terrible hotpot ! never comeback,1
"great authentic food, friendly atmosphere, super service. very reasonable prices for w1. best go as 2 or more, share hot pot. i will be going again - much less expensive than a flight to ulan bator!",5
average chinese hotpot buffet. quite authentic comparing with others in this area.,4
not too bad food but staff could be friendlier,3
"23 per person all you can eat appeared quite steep, but was more than compensated for by the freshness and variety of ingredients. 10% mandatory service charge, waived upon presentation of student card.",5
"decent hotpot, with a range of different meats and vegetables available in an all you can eat format. be sure to get the special sauce.",4
"get the special spicy stock, and about 3 dishes per person feels right. my recommendations would be the fuzhou fish balls and the mongolian bean noodles. at 20 it's not bad for the experience.",2
"great spot for hot pot where each dish is small but cheap so you can try a lot of different things. a good meal not including drinks will cost you around 20 pounds, and i recommend the split pot so you can try both the spicy and non spicy broth.",4
"good hot pot experience, missing ma la spicy soup. good value for money for london",4
"if you order buffet, don't expect that they will serve you the best quality meats. taste is good though.",3
one of the best hotpot i've tried in london!,5
tasty food but abysmal atmosphere in basement.,4
"greathotpot restaurant, good for group of friends and big meat eaters",5
food and service is amazing!! wish i could eat all night.,5
"service is very bad. staff and manager are all so rude. poor quality food, not fresh, all from frozen. not recomended",1
very bad service be careful when oder topping hot potyou need to right down everything you oderthey take extra money/ person,1
all you can eat hotpot with a vast choice of food to choose from. the only downside is the dipping sauces are charged extra and they come in very small plates. ,4
unlimited hot pot buffet is always a winner. the staff let us stay until closing. would have liked more selection on the buffet menu that didn't incur extra cost but the extras were priced pretty heftily.,4
very calm environment with plenty of good food. staff are great!,5
better dining environment than most hot pot restaurants in chinatown. slightly more expensive but the broth does taste nicer. you do have to pay for dipping sauces though.,4
so good nice service,5
hotpot was good,4
too salty. ordered a 2nd round then got told it the last round?? i thought this was unlimited buffet? place didn't seem very clean. bathroom and stairs grubby. i wouldn't eat there again. meal for 3 over 120. not great value at all.,2
meat wasn't fresh. some of meat changed colour.it costs us for 30 pounds per head without drink but still hungry. one of my friends has really bad diarrhoea. avoid it for your own good.,1
"the hotpot was fantastic! spicy but also flavourful broth, and the lamb and beef were tender. the different seafood was also great quality. lovely first experience and would go again for sure!",5
its the best hotpot restaurant in london unlimited refill dishes in 2hr its more than enough red hotpot is great! but recommend trying the whiteand all staffs not too much have a interest to us but there very kind. it makes me had a comfortable dinner,5
amazing customer service. lovely food. would definitely recommend this to all my friends and family!,5
"not worth it for the money at all. the quality of the meats were especially poor and given the very expensive prices one would have to pay for the hotpot, you would expect better ingredients. the beef had a very weird rubbery texture and taste and does not taste anything like beef. totally not worth the price!!!",1
excellent service and amazing food for all the family. highly recommended. the management is incredibly well mannered with an eye for detail. will be back again.,5
delicious hotpot! great and speedy service. the staff were also so welcoming and friendly! i highly recommend this place!,5
"good place to go for a hot pot in london,  lots of choices. interior is not that bright, could have used some renovations. ",4
excellent food. very good service.,5
great hot pot place,5
today i went to this restaurant it was really tasty the lamb was very fresh and the vegetables were very good as well and the waiters were very nice will be coming back again,5
all they want is making money from us. we ordered lots of stuff but then they just gave us less than what we ordered. but the bill still charged all even we didnt have it. the price they put on the bill is not clearlynever come back again!,1
"staff were rude, obnoxious, poorly organised, struggled with the food order, over charged. a generally unpleasant experience.",1
so good i'm returning with more friends: ),5
"really bad service,  rushed us out after 2 hour!",1
got tummy upset even before leaving the restaurant:(,5
"friendly staffs, decent food",5
good food.,5
"great hot pot in central london. there is an all you can eat option which has plenty of choice. we choose three stocks for the pot and we ordered a large variety of meat, fish and vegetables. the price is reasonable and the service was friendly, i would recommend.",4
amazing hot pot. best place to go in china town for spicy food. the staffs were polite and service was phenomenal. the food serve very quick.,5
"i visited little lamb yesterday, the hotpot was delicious, the restaurant location is very close to picadilly circus, chinatown. i spend only 25gbp for one person. very nice.",5
too bloody expensive. the staffs were not very greedy. poor services for new clients. never coming back again!!!,1
this is the best chinese and also mongolian hotpot in chinatown. we really loved the food. it is not expensive.,5
"definitely the best hot pot restaurant in london, nice services, great menu choices and really decent food and at reasonable prices. my friends and i have been here many times and it has consistently exceeded our expectations.",5
"the best hotpot restaurant in chinatown!!! they offer a variety of food for the hotpot and it was delicious, the price was reasonable and the staff was very friendly and approachable. i enjoyed my time there; the place and the atmosphere was a great place to relax and eat. very recommend it",4
went on sunday to eat hot pot with friends. amazing food and great customer service. the tall female host was incredibly nice to us and made great suggestions on what to order. definitely will return. would recommend to all!,5
food was very average. the prawns were bad - not fresh and sticking onto the shell. long wait for food after ordering.,2
"no desserts.. would not ket me  charge my mobile, food was authentic.....",3
booked this restaurant through opentable. restaurant cancelled the reservation without letting us know in-advance. totally recommend again dining here.,1
dont forget my order:),3
"i got noodle soup takeaway but they didn't give me any cutlery like chopstick and spoon, in addition, they use box rather than bowl for the takeaway soup, make it very difficult to eat. the food was not impressive as well, will not visit again.",1
good food and decent service for chinatown.,5
"almost walked past htis place but glad i didn't... very yummy tasty food, it's simple but very good!",5
i really enjoyed visiting this place. everything we ordered was impeccable!! the food tasted delicious.,5
the menu in london chinese restaurants is often so predictable. here the food is much more exotic. a very tasty meal for a good price  - washed down with a decent house white.,4
i've already been here three times. the spicy dishes are quite good. chinese bbq sea bass is one of my favourite . ,4
"small and simple place in chinatown, but the food came fast and was excellent and fairly priced (had chongqing noodles and dumplings). our waiter spoke little english,  but went out of her way to help us.  this might just be a little gem we found here, we'll definitely be back. ",5
great food and nice atmosphere. a must-try for spicy food lovers. authentic sichuan style!,5
nice restaurant. many choice and good moment after theater piece near of there,3
great,5
"really great food at reasonable prices, with space to sit upstairs and downstairs.",4
very tasty and rather authentic food (and i'm native chinese btw). and it's easy to book a table even on busiest days because it's a bit hidden away in the road parallel to main china town street.,4
ok,3
good but expensive.,3
proper spicy stuff. reasonable prices. not children friendly. staff seemed a little rushed.,4
order correct but dishes lukewarm... we can forego the discussion on taste and presentation,1
rude and bad service. they even lied that they don't have place just because we were not big group and they want to offer table for more people so that they can earn more money. never gonna go again,1
looked nice and tasted nice until getting severe stomachache after the meal...will never come back again,1
good for the price,5
great authentic chinese food,5
very nice chinese restaurant,5
"nice food, nice staff",5
worst food i ever ate,1
rude waiter,1
never again,1
"26.5 per person buffet. limited choice. fish and fancy meat need to pay extra money to get. a lot of rules, not like buffet. but bbq are really nice!",3
great taste at reasonable price. staff was very happy to help us customising the order. will definitely visit again.,5
inadequate service,1
all i can say is that dont give me the attitudes. just put on some damn smile and serve as you were supposed to. gosh. i wont go back in there again for sure. i wouldnt give the star if there was an option. horrible service and average food.,1
great food and experience!,5
taste is average but price is much higher than average.,3
"decent place for lunch, i think they have changed to some sort of bbq setup now which i have not tried.",4
"very clean and nice environment, staff were friendly, polite and welcoming. food were fresh and tasty, amazing chinese bbq, the service was brilliant, prices were very competitive as well.",5
small and surprisingly quiet place with friendly service in the middle of a busy city center. portions were very generous. enjoyed the place a lot!,5
best grilled squid in the town. the highlight of london in terms of grilled meat with modern decor. it brings color to chinatown restaurants,5
i love the special bbq technology and taste was really gorgeous!you can chose different flavors and i will come back again soon with my friends!,5
"best ever grilled place in china town with fancy decor. must-try restaurant in london! great taste, friendly staff and reasonable price. will recommend to everyone:)",5
"they have a new restaurant, new furniture and super delicious chinese style grill menu. it was delicious expierence! i will invite my office colleagues to little wooden hut again.",5
"i was taken here by chinese friends and was not disappointed. the chinese bbq was delicious, as were the cold korean noodles. helpful staff and good food.",5
"delicious chinese bbq, friendly staff, and cozy atmosphere. i like here, highly recommended!",5
seriously. the food service is so slow. i could eat a cow. a whole cow. a party of 7 on the second floor. we waited 30 mins for the cold dish. another 30 mins for a hot dish. 35 mins for a bottle of wine. 45 mins for the second hot order. ....... enough says. never return.,1
"food quality was great the first time we went there when the restaurant was just opened. however, now its trying to save budget and the food quality is reduced somehow...a shame.",3
"omg. this is one of the best barbeque restaurants i have ever visited. i suggest you try the spify cabbage as a starter, it's so nice and succulent! the meat was very good as well, so juicy. all in all, the service was great as well. with the servers helping us with our meat.",5
first time chinese style bbq with my friend in little wooden hut. fresh ingredientseco-friendly barbecuespacious dinning environment. five-star recommendation. you cannot miss it,5
went there with 2 friends and ordered a lot of bbq. the lamb bbq is so juicybbq squid is a little bit spicy. all in all- 5 stars!,5
"way too expensive for this kind of food, not worth the money.",3
this is the best bbq restaurant what i have been to.also a very fantastic place to have a party there.new technology for bbqamazing!,5
"good place to chill or spent time with your colleagues ,family and friends,been there twice since it was refurbished and reopened as a chinese bbq house last week, tasty original chinese style, cold noodle soup etc, highly recommended!",5
"this place is too pricey, compare to other restaurant in china town. food is ok but most are overprice. the quantity per order was tiny. do not go to this place when you in london.",1
great foodi think it is the best grill lamb in london. next time will bring my friend together.,5
"i really don't get all the negative reviews. this is such a lovely place. very tasty chinese food, one of the most authentic i had in london. service was quick and the young lady was kind and enthusiastic. we will definitely go back. oh, and dinner for two was 25 with service, for this area it's more than reasonable.",5
"they changed to become a grill bbq place and its not for the better. staff are confused, the menu is too pricey for the quantities you get, and the whole place could use an exhaust fan. go elsewhere.",1
"the dishes are okay, but not the attitude of the servers. they show little kindness and hospitality. i feel like i'm not really welcomed. the other chinese restaurant is better than this.",2
"very tasty, spicy chinese, helps to know some mandarin when ordering. reasonable prices, clean and they take cards. beef tendon cooked to perfection, spicy honeycomb to die for (it doesn't contain honeycomb btw! :)will definitely visit again",5
"better to avoid the crowds in gerrard street and dine round the corner in here. don't be put off by the seemingly plain, functional interior. the food is fabulous and generous in amount!",5
"loved their original menu so much, used to be my favourite place in london for food. however, they recently changed their menu.",4
"i really enjoyed this place! they accommodated to a dietary restriction and were very concerned with whether or not i liked the food. they did a fantastic job, and i hope to return here next time i'm in london!",5
best chinese in town. enjoyed every meal i've had here. dan dan noodle is my favorite. you can't go wrong ordering here. the lunch special for 2 is also a good deal.,5
"the prices are good and the food is so, so fresh. there is a certain mystique to heading down that street knowing there is good food there",4
always the best!!!,5
"cheap, authentic and tasty. they sell all kinds of cheung fun, noodles and turnip cake as well. ",5
1 fresh noodles und surprisingly friendly for chinatown,5
this place is great. get a huge slab of turnip cake (lobakgo) and bags of buns (chasiubao) to make dim sum at home.,5
best noodles in london and also try the dumplings which are amazing after 5 minutes of steaming,5
love this small shop,5
"the secret shop in the middle of chinatown, cheap ho fun that's fresh and still soft to handle, yummy bao also available. all so cheap. it's amazing what you can find down a dark alleyway.",5
"this hidden germ sells the best chinese tapas,  such as char siu bun.",5
"a noodles factory hidden behind all the flashy chinese restaurants in chinatown. this is a true hidden gem that sells fresh noodles, in big bags and low prices.",5
cash only,5
"a fresh noodle factory in the heart of london, pretty much unheard of. grab the bags of noodles for a few pounds when you want to cook them, they aren't as good within a few days as fresh (no shelf stable food here!) check their fridge for other extras, you'll find some dim sum favourites.",5
here's the menu incase you wonder what they got,5
"love their products. always get cut rice noodles,  and sheet noodles for my ho fan and cheung fan. i love their turnip/radish cake as i cut and pan fry them. delish!",5
amazing fresh ho fun - perfect for making dried beef ho fun. massive portions as well for a pound. i would definitely recommend a visit to this wonderful establishment. pork buns are a winner too!!,5
i bought rice noodle rolls from here. i really like what they make. but.. the place can be easily missed and the surrounding area is really dirty. the place itself is very very compact and not exactly appetising.,3
best place for fresh noodle. note you have to use them the day you buy them,5
got the best radish cakewhy are they closing:(((,5
"been visiting for last 16 years , price always remain the same for the ho fun 1/lb weight. freshly make every days, lot softer and tastier than those purchased from supermarket shelves. this is the best place to buy ho fun in united kingdom, there's no place like this and quality of the noodle can't be beaten",5
a hidden gem to find chinese rice noodles (hor-fun) priced at 1 a pack. also available are fresh cheung fun and various baos to bring home to steam. this is a small shop in the back alley of dansey place - just look for the little sign atop the door entrance and go inside.,5
"honestly, get in before is too late!",5
best place for noodles and pau buns!,5
tasty,5
"fast service, tasty food, very popular and clean environment. not expensive. good selection of chinese dishes available. credit cards accepted including american express. ",4
"great food, some have also good prices. one of the best chinatown's for sure. everything is pretty high quality",4
"terrible restaurant. the ribs tastes like days old, ziran lamb can't tell if it's lamb or pork.",2
top,5
"nice restaurant, nice food",4
no don't waste your money tasteless food poor quality,2
"love this place, a must visit for the food and atmosphere too.",5
manchester chinese town is better.. both is surrounding.. okay if you use public transport.. don't bother driving there..,3
you must visit! good is amazing.,4
"some good dishes, good service. the ambience is just fine. the sweetsour prawns where very tasty and also the crispy duck. it was also good the starters plate and the won ton",3
good place for meeting up with friends.,5
"at the london chinatown restaurant you can find fresh, handmade dumplings!! the place is correctly famous for its fried dumplings, which are pretty delicious. don't get anything else, it's not worth it. bad customer service, but hey, that's part of your chinese experience! ",3
food wasn't too bad but it was the staff that really let this place down.rude manager and the rest of the staff were very miserable and all seemed in a rush to get your money and get you out of there.,2
loved it. the best restaurant in china town,5
"great selection of food.  my only issue is when there is a sign saying 'street food here', which points you inside a restaurant.  if the food is off the street, then its not street food.",4
i like this place,4
staff very rude and abrupt,2
very good customer service,5
lovely place very busy,5
"very nice place. first tried it with a spontaneous crowd of my own followers, the staff were very helpful, food was great.",5
"poor service and food was okay, nothing special, have had better takeaways",2
what a wonderful little place that serves traditional chinese food,4
loved the food at golden phoenix.,5
great dim sum! comparable to dim sum found in hong kong restaurants!,5
"great dim sum selection. freshly cooked, all reasonably priced. smallish restaurant fills quickly. friendly staff. ",4
"well, i am a chines food fan but to be very honest one can find better chines food at other places then so called china town but yes should visit once & have experience of your own.",3
great food hear. very busy. constant supply of fresh food to the buffet! for the price i personally think that it's great value for money!,5
"fantastic part of london. authentic food, very reasonable prices. great night or day.",5
worst restaurant i have been to. rude and unpleasant straffmy stomach hurts after,1
"great meal, we were really satisfied",5
"china town is found amongst all the good things that are to be found in london. in the heart of touristic london it is energetic and colourful. it also has high quality and incredibly affordable food. choose anywhere, you can't go wrong. ",3
awesome +wow,5
very nice,5
i would put zero stars this place is completely rubbish. the waitress we had was rude she gave us wine that tasted of vinegar and when we asked her to taste it she said it was fine and told us to taste vinegar is we wanted to drink vinegar.,1
"great service super quality food, highly recommend. great atmosphere and very friendly staff. will go again.",5
one of my favourite dim sum restaurants in chinatown.,5
mediocre. overpriced. not actively unpleasant but not good either.,2
well quite a good restaurant for the prices,4
"not bad, went on a monday lunchtime and it was quite quiet. shanghai dumplings are better at jade garden and generally the food is good but there's nothing outstanding. even though it wasn't very busy there never seemed to be any waiters around when we needed. the booths at the back look cosy.",3
best place in the west end.,5
"tried chinese noodles + roasted duck here. superb taste. can't guarantee on other items, but you can definitely try these.",4
"tiny portions that were completely overpriced. staff rather unfriendly. food came out in 5 minutes but was cold, felt like it had been reheated. very disappointed! local chinese takeaway was much nicer for a quarter of the price!",1
good for a fast lunch staff could smile a bit more,4
my favourite dim sum establishment in chinatown - the most authentic flavours and staff are friendly,5
"fab food and great service, we had the duck and singapore noodles. good beer selection and some great set menus ",5
"chinatown in london is small, only two/three small streets. but its nice to see it and eat in some cool restaurant.",4
very typical chinese shops and food. some weird massage places but charming ;),5
"london's chinatown is a wonderful place to be, with genuine quality asian cuisine spread over a couple of roads. favourite restaurants include the lotus garden or dumpling legend",5
the choice of food exceeded my expectations. there is a lovely walk around and a good selections of restaurants ...try more than one place ...,5
huge choice of oriental places to eat just off leicester square.,4
"not much atmosphere, food served very quick as is rather simple.it was all well cooked, but a little over priced.",3
"superb place, had an amazing chilli beef",5
tons of aging chinese (and a few japanese) restaurants. some great chinese stores. good photo opportunities ,4
"cheap & cheerful chinese buffet. always busy, great place for a quick meal.",4
who doesnt love china town! its fun and fragrant. i got to try different cakes and desserts.,4
weird staff not very friendly. i had stomach ache after eating there. not coming back for sure.,3
love chinatown,5
"always busy, always crowded but i love it. you can choose fron a lot of restaurants. and also in love with the food stores. i bought a lot veggies and fruits  to my thai dishes. bit pricey but absolutely worth it.",5
the set lunch at 18.50 was great. lots of goodies and far better than any other place in chinatown at that price.,5
chinese new year is always great in chinatown even when it's pouring with rain. lots of food and entertainment on offer. ,5
great food and loads of little shops to buy asian food supplies.  you must try the kowloon bakery for their pastries ,5
nice food and service!,5
"having seen a few chinatowns around the world i have to say this one is not bad.  it's got a number of grocery shops, chinese medicine, bakery, shops with a bit of everything and asian restaurants peppered throughout.  and it's right amongst it in the west end.  ",5
"china town is a must visit area of soho, try to head down to chinatown during the chinese new year festivities for a really good time.lot's great restaurants (not so good if you don't like oriental food i guess!) and some excellent shops and bakeries.",5
"chinatown is definitely the place you have to visit if you want to try either chinese cuisine or buy chinese food. various food choice, dim sum, hot pot or common chinese cuisine. most of the restaurants are good, however the services of some of them are really bad, and the food was way below my expectation. ",4
very good place...try the lon don china special noodles,5
authentic chinese dim sum for a good price.,5
"popped in for the all you can eat buffet. some selections were ok, some not so good. very busy and noisy but can't complain.",2
"delicious food, good service at moderate prices. best dim sum in soho",4
if u very hungry its great place to eat and have good time,5
"good food, rude waitresses and gross toilets. wont be back",2
"located close to piccadilly circus, chinatown is teeming with people and activity as expected.  if you're looking for good chinese fare, this is definitely a place to visit.",4
lovely selection...delicious....cheap.,5
"an experience, fantastic food",4
"one of my favourite places to be, all those chinese restaurants provide my country's food, some are with original taste not the kind suitable for british, heehee, if you like to try the real chinese food-new china is one of them.",5
"mediocre food at cheap price. you pay for what you get. mostly quite dried out, and obviously reheated.",1
decent food. good price.,5
been here for dimsum and had a good time. but mix hot & cold in balance so you can lighten up your afternoon for a fair price :),4
if you like chinese food the variety is good. i would recommend the new world on gerard place for its excellent dim sum,5
"a great environment, full of great places to eat, from cheap buffet bars to more upmarket restaurants. super market sand corner stores selling chinese food to take home. the cakes next to the kowloon buffet are great but you don't want to eat them as they look cute wit the hand made pandas sat on top!!",4
very bad service the waiter was very rude and aggressive after we did not understand what he said..i will never get back to this place because of him..food was nothing special on top of it..,1
good customer service,3
ordered 20 lunch meal for two. ended up costing 22. small portions and very rude staff with mediocre food. avoid - better restaurants around.,1
they didn't provide a proper bill despite multiple insistence.,2
"traditional chinese dishes, large restaurant space, great food.",4
"typical chinatown restaurant, food okay, service okay, neither outstanding.",3
horrible! very unfriendly stuff! cold dishes! overpriced for that kind of food! horrible toilets! definitely not recommendable!!,1
food was good service was terrible,2
very nice atmosphere and very delicious!,5
decent food but rather expensive,3
great choice of dim sum . fabulous food service was quick and pleasant. will be returning soon.,5
not too good better options available in china town.,2
very expensive for common chinese food not worth the money,2
food was pretty good and service was fast.,5
"horrible service. went there with chinese friends that said food was mediocre. for me food was ok, nothing special.",2
"terrible, the food is full of msg...",1
amazing food. good portions. 10 pound special for crispy duck set. would recommend for great british chinese food,5
it's a busy restaurant in london china town. ok but hectic,3
"another chinese restaurant in london chinatown. bit expensive, food is ok",4
the food is good i don't really like chinese and i'm scared to try new things but this was the best food ever but the minus of the restaurant is that your orders get messed upb,4
"i guess it requires renovations, a bit more cleaning and a better distribution of tables. we were all packed in a tiny place - but i was there for chine nye -. food quite good",3
"never have i experienced such rude service. from the start. food was ok, but not at the cost of arrogance. i went here with friends, but they seem to think being in a tourist 'hot spot' gives them the right to treat customers badly. thankfully people read google reviews and don't bother with this place.",1
my favourite chinese restaurant in the whole of china town in london been eating in there  for 30 plus years  great,5
fast service and good food.,5
great food. great service.,5
"been going to this restaurant for years. usually have dim sum about every 6 weeks. love the siu mai, kai lan with garlic, prawn toast, stuffed bean curd rolls and yam croquettes.",5
good food and good service. nothing special though like most chinese restaurant s.,4
decent food and decent price.,3
standard chinese food that is fast and reasonable,3
their vegetarian noodle is good so is their tea. their wc is not clean.,4
"had the most amazing meal, china town has atmosphere and a real buzz",5
"horrible service. the staff was rude to my friends and i, and the waiter did not want to explain the dishes to us. the food was ok, but i was turned off because of the service i received. there are far better restaurants in soho with nicer staff that i can spend my money on.",1
ive ordered won tan soup and fried won tan...the fried won tan was ok but not something you expect to get in a chinese restaurant...the won tan soup was ok too but still not that good...friendly service and ok prices tho,3
unbelievable that in 2019 we still can find a place serving shark fins in central london.,1
love the food!!,5
food glorious food.. good eating all around.,5
"excelent food,  quick service, lacking atmosphere due to busy location",4
just ok dim sum. thick cheung fun. very oily deep fried veg rolls. all party must be there in order to get a table.,2
"a great place to visit in london, easily accessed by leicester square tube station. i love how easy it is to navigate as the streets are pedestrian only. so many restaurants to choose from - a fabulous choice of dim sum from 12 noon onwards.",4
worst service in london... with hundreds of people constantly crowding chinatown the staff at this restaurant could care less about service or if you walk out -  someone else will easily walk in. the food was decent at best.,1
terrible dirty bad mannered staff and the amount of oil in the food was rediculous,1
it is not a huge china town for example such as china town in thailand but it is a nice place to visit in london . also it is near piccadilly square.,3
"decent food, depressing service. the staff didn't look at us when taking our order nor when receiving payment. we enjoyed the food but not the rest. the mandatory service charge was definitely not deserved. wont re-visit; i'd advise you the same.",2
i always love have dim sum at this restaurant.,5
who is the head chef?,4
nice place... good food and excelent customer service,5
"sad place indeed, food very mediocre and staff are just rude. dont waste your money and pay that bit extra for a genuine experience.",1
"excellent food, great service, good atmosphere and comprehensive menu. one of the better ones in chinatown.",5
"fantastic japanese food at relatively reasonable prices and a great selection of sake, we had a sparkling sake that was easily the equal of a good champagne. the bar downstairs is pricey but refreshing quiet for a friday evening.",5
"try the duck, or at least the half duck",5
"good prices, enjoyed the chefs special. food was tasty but nothing to write home about. service not bad - a bit perfunctory but they were busy. not a romantic spot. lots of locals and families. always a good sign.",4
went here by accident the foid was great! would recommend,4
"nice place , good food and drink",5
too much vinegar in duck with ginger and pineapple and overally i can't tell that i enjoyed it much. the serving was smaller than i expect from chinese restraunts.,2
lovely foodgreat staffwell worth it!,5
"if you're accustomed to american ""chinese"" food, get ready for a real experience. this is like nothing you've tried, and as authentic as you can get outside of china. i love london's chinatown restaurants and eat there every time i visit",5
long queue and food was over priced,2
good chinese restaurants,5
so far so good. staff always chatted together ignor customers request.,3
chinatown has to be on anyone's list. great food,5
very busy place. no halal restaurants. had a nice time with family members. children love the bakery and toy shop and nice shops for presents.,4
we were 9 did not book a table they accepted us great food,4
"food is delicious, but smaller portions than i'm used to, and higher prices. very nice asian ambiance.",5
love it here.busy,5
always come here for delicious food when i miss home in london. such a vibrant and nice community. always worth for a trip if you want to experience south china culture:)),5
try china noodle there..is really different,5
"bought whole roast duck takeaway this evening.whole duck chopped and packed into two tiny plastic container. very oily. stange enough,cant find any drumsticks in the two containers. definately wont go again.",1
fantastic place to eat,5
"lovely grub, eat till you burst.",5
my favourite dim sum restaurant in china town but only if you want traditional dim sum. might not be best for people who are not used to having traditional dim sum.,4
great dishes at affordable prices,5
"the most unfriendly stuff and service, very bad experience. the crispy duck is very dry, looks poor, the beef tastes old and dry too. we ordered 3 persons menu came with only two set of saurce, can't compare with real peking duck. will never go again!",1
food was poor and staff slow,2
good service and good dim sum very tasty :),4
wonderful place... loads of chinese restaurants... love the bakery there... amazing stuff... ,4
i love chinatown food a bit to expensive but very tasty,5
very tasty and cheap chinese food,5
my favourite restaurant in chinatown. best service; one of the few chinese restaurants that does not rush you to finish the food and pay. price very reasonable. dishes are healthy and not too oily. i come here to eat almost every week! ,5
first time to chinatown and a great first experience! the chicken dumplings + chicken fried noodles was exceptional - will definitely come again!,5
tasty chinese meals,5
"very good food, people are alittle rude but it's worth the food",4
to many time go there getting bored. but it's good place to visit if you are visit london,5
"i will often eat here when in london. food good, service fast, one waitress a bit direct and comes off as being a little rude but a good place to eat overall.",4
"a very busy but exciting place to visit. chinese food here is different (but delicious) from chinese food served in the usa.example, chinese fried rice in new york is fried with soy sauce to give it a distinctive light brown color.  in london and france the fried rice was white.",5
brilliant food,5
absolutely stunning great experience,5
"i would give this place a 0 star if i could.  the food is not only not authentic chinese food, it is also not cooked well.  the pork strips tastes like something that is better served in a mcdonald or a wok-to-go place.  the beef is stringy and not cooked properly.   the rice is stale.",1
i spend a lot of time in and around this area when i go to london. it's always bright and vibrant. a shame i haven't got the money to comeback and live in london. lots of happy memories of the west end!,5
yummy! really excellent food! i recommend this restaurant,5
"absolutely tasty food, can't get better. staff are lovely. won't be disappointed if you come here",5
didnt feel like you could relax here as i felt the staff were in a rush to get you out to get the table filled for someone else to eat  but the food was great all tou can eat buffet,3
chaotic fun & good food,4
great value meal for two. very tasty too,5
"decent prices and the food was very nice and plentiful. its not the best in terms of decor, but it's not a dump.",4
"helpful staff, good food, good value.",5
"a man server is very rude and inspite of it, they even forced me to pay 10% tips. whenever my family placed additional orders, the rude man server sighed and told us why we didn't order at one time. the service was terrible and the rude server must be psycho.",1
food came bit by bit and in most places dim sum always come together. when it finally did arrive it was nice. tables perched on a stage we're left stranded for about 20 minutes before they could catch the eye of the waiter. they left after half an hour of starvation and boredom.,3
"very nice interior. we had the 10 set menu. but were not offered this initially; we had to ask. except for the duck & pancakes (duck very dry) , the rest was very nice. portions a bit small for 2.",3
excellent food ..and outstanding service.,5
food was not as nice as i thought it would be and expensive for what you got. staff not friendly didn't ask if the food was ok. if they did i would have told them it was luke warm.,1
enjoyed london china town music and dance,5
"the pork was not tasty , need some more vinegars and sugar, this restaurant used to be a good one but after changing the management pork dishes lost his original taste",2
"for central london, you can get a very reasonably priced chinese meal here. situated right in china town its really easy to find. a large menu with good value set meals (probably the best way to enjoy your visit). food quality is fine and it's served piping hot. some of the staff are a bit dour but others pleasant.",4
"the food was good, but the venue was very old og tired. the staff was extremely stressed,  so the leve of service was not good at all. er hardly got to order out food before the waitor rushed away. when we were almost done eating, they cleaned  out tables and asked if de wanted to pay.",2
great idea of all inclusive restaurant in combination with chinese cuisine. disappointed a bit that price at the entrance is different than inside (guess higher or lower),4
most boring place i have seen,1
"good restaurant with great location most of the time is full but for sure you will find a free table. the food is amazing and cheap. the portions are massive so don't order a lot of things, you won't be able to eat all of them. the staff is great and they will give you a lot of attention.",4
"good food, pleasant service",4
"such a tourist rip off, portions are child size , although i must admit tasty.. prices way too high... service below  average... avoid eating here, if you can",1
enjoyed my business lunch here. the food was superb!,5
"speedy service, very friendly helpful staff, delicious food, huge helpings!!! very reasonably priced. see you in april when we are back!!! (review by the teachers )",5
"the food was ok, id say tasty... but the bill didnt have any prices on it and after reading these google reviews about the billings, i feel that we might got be fooled they also dont accept contactless or apple pay",3
"friendly, central, excellent value. sat in a booth - bit cramped, but fun!!",5
"fantastic. food, food stores, and people. ask for credit card conditions before ordering.  if crowded, you willl have to wait.",5
great food section. amazing atmosphere. great vegetarian menu. food was delicious at great prices. i went there for lunch with my friend. great services.,4
"the food and the wine was great but the service was poor (the table next to us provided much entertainment with the service they got). the dim sum was a little expensive, there were only 4 veggie options and a lot of that menu had sold out.",3
"food was great, but it was super busy and we needed to wait 10 minutes for our table. after all, stuff was pretty rude and we felt that we need to leave quickly our table because there is a pressure from people waiting for the table. i didn't feel that welcome at all.",3
crispy aromatic duck was of great quality.service was satisfactory.overall a good experience!,4
"very good food, need to improve their service. also, majority (not all) staff is a bit rude",4
great food. kids left clean plates for all dishes. was a return visit and have not been disappointed.,4
amazing food. best calamari i've ever had. nice staff and atmosphere. central location in chinatown with affordable prices. would highly recommend.,5
"the food is quite nice, but it hard to tell how much you are getting. furthermore, the food made me feel a little sick the day after. the staff are all very nice and the 2 people meals are more than enough for 2, and possibly even 4.",3
"value for money,but nothing special, buffet has no test after food can stay for hours waiting till it's finnish,and bring new cooked food, it's good whenever you are hungry, it's eat as much as you can.",4
food just about warm. not cheap. / disappointed.,3
"good place for a quick meal, portion sizes could be bigger however.",3
"one of the worst chinatown experiences we've had. very poor service, the soups we were brought were cold, the dishes were overpriced with small servings, and the quality of the meal itself was below average.",1
tasty food and nice staff,4
been coming here for years. great food and staff and in my opinion the best place to eat in china town.,5
nice food and very friendly staff.,5
awful and rude service! terrible!,1
one of the more busier resturants in china town,5
"chinese food in different parts of the world and i would have to say this was one of the worst. besides being relatively affordable, by uk standards, the food was just not that good",2
good food and a lot of hustle and bustle.,4
"poor quality food, the least flavourful chinese restaurant ive ever been too. the service couldnt be more careless. food only thrown at your table and theyre always trying to clean it up even if you havent finished yet. on top of that its quite pricey it compared to the others in the region. dont waste your time",2
good food recommend the 10.00 lunch deal very good value.,4
bit fast food taste,3
"not bad, dim sum where of good portion size - a bit too salty though. the stir fried beef ho fun had good wok hei but the noodles were too dry and needs a bit more seasoning.",3
always good dim sum,5
"while the menu has a huge selection, the food was  pretty bland in my opinion.",3
good food...,4
not the best by far... plenty better restaurants around,2
"genuine chinese food, quick service even when full",4
worst food i have ever eaten!!!  this place was so poor i actually feel like i have had my money stolen.  the food was not off but it was so poor it tasted like it.  we asked for an omelette and got a fried egg.,1
food was fantastic here. great place to eat,5
amazing food! staff are not really chatty but not awful either,4
"food was edible... had the beef stir fry and pork cashew - would not recommend either also worth noting, a few of the good reviews for this place are mistakenly for the whole chinatown and not the actual restaurant.",2
"food is wonderful, service can be a bit unreliable. note that the total bill includes service.",4
lovely note out with family lovely food lovely restaurant,5
"tons of  buffet food, very cheap at 5.00 pp. as we ate full plates 5 times.",5
go there and they its good,5
good food. affordable and efficient service.,5
great value! great food!,5
"great place to visit, you can expect good food but you are paying chinatown prices.",5
good food and dim-sum. photos of dim- sum dishes so that the non-chinese can be aware what they are about to order. attentive service.,5
me and my wife have been going for 10 years and we are never disappointed. they are famous for their dimsum but mains is also delicious,5
"great food. decent portions, good slection of food. the service not so great. very pushy staff. once we placed our order and our food arrived. the staff was gone, with no one in sight. we waited a while to have someone come over. in the end, walked up to the counter ourselves to ask if we could have the bill.",3
a strange restaurant. the food was really nice and the prices were quite cheap for what we had (the set menu on the inside cover with courses). 5 out of 5 for the food.,3
nice duck nice truck nice f..,5
their dim sum is worth trying when youre nearby around lunchtime.,5
"rubbish, food was freezing cold, whilst the price on the door looks reasonable i feel ripped off, cheek of it is they add a service charge automatically for cold food. can tell they don't rely on repeat business",1
"the food here was amazing, i want to go back! best chinese food i ever had, staff were helpful and welcoming.",5
"a reasonably priced restaurant for central london. the food is tasty and plentiful. staff are a little brusque but allowed for a small change in their set menu, so i was happy with that.",4
"one of the nicest, my chinese friends go. it's most vibrant china town than others. chinese shops and many other restaurants as well.",5
food was served quickly and efficiently. the staff are friendly and helpful. nice food,5
"my recent visit on monday bank holiday was fantastic. the food was so tasty. i could identify each piece food by it,s taste. i can recommend the london chinatown restaurant to anybody. john barry",5
food poor at best. staff utterly disinterested on the point of being rude. avoid,2
they are really kind and their food are the best i really recommend this place,5
super nice chinese food!!,4
great food and reasonable too!,5
tasty food and polite chinese service. but not clean,3

i highly recommend plc soho. the staff are exceedingly helpful - karolina in particular provides a superior level of customer service; and alex is a most exceptionally professional beauty technician.,5
consultation was very good looking forward to seeing results with the treatment.,5
naomi is a bit rough on the skin and also hope the length of treatment can be the same as indicated on the website. this time is 15mins shorter.,4
"if any of you guys go for laser hair removal, ask for alex! she's literally the best around and i wouldn't want anyone else to do my laser for me! highly recommend her. she's literally the best out there!",5
i had treatment done here and i payed 1000 but there no chances whats so ever! waste of money and time. its all fake and no results!,1
good selection of chinese food and some kitchen products.,4
loved it everything you need,5
"gotta hand it to this place, with a storefront that can barely fit 40 people there was about 20 people in line at any time. the selection of produce is defintely cheapter and fresher than other places but its no `us sized asian food store. but it serves its purpose right? fresh asian food and good prices. can't complain",3
"cheap food, good service, nice environment.",5
good sized oriental supermarket,4
"a wide range of asian food, ingredients, and goods. very cramped for the amount of people visiting daily, very crowded in the weekend.",4
"a little bit small, but has a lot of authentic chinese stuff that i'm used to from hong kong.",4
"it's a nice place to shop some oriental food, but it's always crowded and sometimes it smells so horrible.",3
good selection of asian goods. ,4
"there are three major supermarkets in china town, this is definitely the worst ",1
best prices in china town - london,5
"has most of the things i was looking for, especially my chinese cough honey drink ",4
complete range of chinese spices and products,4
literally a chinese super market selling chinese goods what ever you are looking for from the east you are likely to find it there :),4
always busy but really good selection of asian groceries!,4
good durian,5
almost everything asian anybody could want is here.,4
"nice range of goods, very cramped aisles, though.",4
a good selection of chinese food and ingredients. can be long queues at checkout.,4
"same selection of products youll find at any other loon fung supermarket, except this one is way to busy and sometimes the staff proves to be quite rude. youre better off looking for another supermarket, youll have a far better experience.",2
"nice selection and prices.still, i have had an issue paying with my non-uk credit card, like being triple charged (they promised it'll be reversed)",4
"good supermarket to get chinese groceries, can be a little busy.",4
wide range of products but massive queues,4
"a little chaotic with staff not really inclined to talk if you are not chinese, but nevertheless a wide selection of products on hand.",3
quite crowded but the stocks are nice and the prices are reasonable.,5
"great selection of chinese food, as well as japanese, korean, indonesian, indian and other east asian cuisines. this is my go-to asian specialty store when i want to stock up on food. they also have a good selection of fresh chinese vegetables. staff is usually quite helpful. the value is not bad either.",5
one of the best chinese supermarkets in london chinatown,5
awesome shop! they have stuff you really cant find anywhere else in london!,5
"the market is very nice, the local employees are kind and very attentive.",4
"mentally overcrowded and extremely cramped so unless you arrive at a quiet time, don't bother. good fresh vegetable selection, however.",4
was really lovely very down to earth not fancy by any means but the food was amazing choice wide and not expensive at all,5
"love this place been going for years, great products, cheap prices and friendly staff.",4
cheap price can get many kinds of asians,4
chinese provision shop with lots of food stuff.,4
basically you can buy everything here. nice.,4
"very large selection of chinese goods. however, at peak times, this little store becomes so packed it is difficult to move around especially when the isles only fit about 1 person.",3
"lots of people, especially in weekends. have to say cashiers are really efficient, will go buy things again",4
"really, really reasonably priced and a fab selection. great place to get different tofu, chilli sauces, noodles, miso and  interesting ingredients - like sesame sauces",5
"my favourite chinatown supermarket; great selection from many countries. it's almost always busy, i've been there when the queue was right around the shop but the staff is super efficient so it moved pretty quickly",5
i greeted the cashier serving us and she didnt reply. when we said thanks and bye she even rolled her eyes. what was that for?,1
"diverse supermarket with many food items, fresh produce and groceries.",5
you could find anything here,5
it's a place selling chinese groceries,4
crowded like no other. avoid at all costs.,1
good but too busy.,4
"huge variety of supplies. strongly recommend their mooncakes, top quality and cheapest in chinatown!",5
since it's mooncake festival time so had to try the moon cakes. it was my first time trying one. i think i may have had very high hopes so when i tasted it i thought it was an okayish moon cake.did not try other items but this one was passe,3
best and largest selection of asian products and groceries in london. there are 3 floors dedicated to different countries and cuisines so you know its extensive. :),5
"it's a small place and always crowded, but somehow they manage to have variety of things, good prices and fast service. loved it, would come back again!",5
in the heart of china town this supermarket has nearly everything you can think of and would be difficult to find elsewhere.get place to discover a new favourite snack or to stock up tastes of home or travel.good staff and a well organised shop but can get a bit tight at times.,5
"this chinese supermarket claims to be london's oldest supplier of oriental foods. i don't know about that, but they do have all sorts of exciting chinese goods, from noodles and sauces to exotic fresh fruits and vegetables as well as their famous 'wing wing' sausages. they also have in-house butchery and a fishmonger.",5
the pork i bought in here on december 14th is stinking but its expiration date is 19th. this is the second time that i paid for the spoiled pork.,1
"yum.. 2 bottles of lingham's malaysian ginger chilli & garlic sauce, gluten free soy sauce by yutaka, 2 kg of pak choi & 2 packets of rice vermicelli & rice noodles. my kitchen is going to be busy today! allow time for your shopping  as loon fung are always busy.",5
lots of things here and they accept apple pay or contactless unlike the other asian supermarkets in chinatown but the aisles are very narrow and gets packed during the evening,4
very good products but customer service could be improved.,2
supermarket is great but i don't give it 5 stars because they don't accept american express,4
the place is packed in the weekends. the aisles are very narrow and you have to squeeze yourself past other customers so feels quite stressful and isn't conducive to a good shopping experience. the queue to pay is quite long too but it moves quickly.,3
best variety of asian foods you in london. butchers improved since renovation. brace yourself for the queue! it's like primark in here.,5
great mart selling asian items. they also have a section selling fresh seafood such as fish and prawns. will recommend here if you are looking for asian products,4
very popular- expect to queue a while but great selection - much better to buy dumplings from here than your typical supermarket,5
good selection of foods divided into countries. great frozen section and good service. a little expensive compared to other supermarkets,4
this is one of the best chinese supermarkets in london. there's so much to see & buy from fresh produce to frozen to the more unusual you wouldn't see elsewhere. well worth a visit,4
great supermarket in the heart of soho that carries an extremely wide selection of foods. i don't know a better shop. always busy but with s good atmosphere.,5
you can find almost all needed chinese food in this supermarket ,4
whenever i need to stock up on my chinese food then i go here. the staff are always very polite and helpful,4
busy shop....in chinatown....,4
they have a good selection of stuff but the isle are narrower than the trenches in vietnam and the staff are so rude at check out. avoid,1
"the supermarket is a lot smaller than the opposite of the street one and something is really more expensive than the another one. for fresh veggies, i think this one has less choices and some veggies are not provided. this supermarket might be suitable for only chinese buyers but  not other nationalities like thais or japanese.",2
expensive and incredibly busy chinese supermarket selling all the standard brands from the east.,3
a lot of asian food,5
closed for good now,1
reasonable choice.,3
good for oriental foods ,3
disorganised,2
"a lot of chinese food, but the price is a bit high.",4
great choices but always overcrowded! ,3
"you can find anything, and i mean it",4
good quality of selection,3
apparently they used the packaging to trick me buying this useless meat.,1
can find most chinese food,4
chinese in london need this!,4
if you're in soho go buy something from this shop!,5
very good chinese food ( hong kong style ) really worth having a try. not your typical tourist trap,5
"decent selection, but higher prices than outside central london. good meat section. way too crowded much of the time, try to come midday.",4
one of the few places that does the duck pancakes.  took the opportunity to put some in my freezer as they are a hit with the family.,4
"perfect place to look for ingredients you'll struggle to find elsewhere.during my last visit though, my friend asked a staff member if they had something in stock and they simply replied that they weren't sure and walked away. this was the only instance we experienced that here and it is otherwise a nice environment.",4
good supermarket but small space can get really crowded it smells bad and be aware of pickpockets in the shop and on the town.,3
"just fantastic shopping, so many great smells, just go and try something new",5
new layout is better but it is still crowded,4
spring rools,5
"good oriental grocery , fast lines and they have durian !",3
"very authentic and loads of choice. i love coming here for fresh food (vegetables, meats, fish).",5
well stocked oriental super - great for those homesick expat chinese. packaged soup bases are a godsend. the exotic veggies dept on the ground floor are worth exploring,3
one of my favourite asian markets. it does need some refurbishment though. always very busy.,3
"i've been coming to this place since i was a kid, huge selection of chinese food, vegetables and drinks fresh fish and meat, and some kitchen ware too. they now also stock some japanese, korean, malaysian and other oriental foods. ",5
i always buy meat from there xd,5
it's one of the most popular chinese supermarkets in town and often crowded.,4
brilliant range of asian shiz,3
"great chinese supermarket,  lots of food and ingredients found here,  but always busy as very popular ",5
huge selection of oriental food products packed into 3 floors,4
probably the most well known asian supermarket in london as they carry products from all over asia ,4
good place to buy chinese style foods that u cant get anywhere else. does get a little hard to move around sometimes,4
great asian supermarket,5
got loads of nice produce and veg at very good prices and its in the best area for asian food dumplings noodles etc..and most are busy.,3
amazing asian supermarket! where you can find many things! love it.,5
you can find almost all the goods from china,5
"after all these years i wonder if they're owned by the same people. generally more squeezy, but prices are strangely 5-10% less than across the street!! yes. for the same soy sauce or frozen dumpling, it'll cost less. so just squeeze abit, and know what you want. ",5
"sells a good variety of mainly chinese products/produce, but they also have other asian foods; korean, japnese and thai. it is quite cramped for space, so avoid busy times.",4
the largest chinese supermarket in london china town. there is even a butcher within this store. be aware that it also means the smell in this store may not be pleasant. the price is reasonable and customary. you can find almost all the ingredients you need for preparing your chinese cooking.,4
a great variety of asian groceries. be aware of long queue.,4
"retailing humble chinese foodstuffs, new loon moon's gerrard street store has expanded exponentially since it opened over 40 years...",4
"one of a few chinese supermarkets in the area, loon fung is generally better for fresh foods, having a large butchers counter stacked with beef, pork, and delicacies like chicken hearts. others are better for dried, frozen or snacks though, as their selection here is pretty small.",3
good range of ingredients at reasonable price,5
friendly staff a lot of range food good price,5
"decent selection of essential asian ingredients and snacks. it is, however, really crammed inside",3
fantastic asian market! they have everything!!!,5
a well stocked chinese maze. very crowded on the weekends. ,4
"everyweek supply point, at the heart of london china town.",5
good selection of chinese and east asian food.,4
a goos place to buy chinese groceries,4
a good selection for its size at reasonable cost ! well worth a look !,4
dirty and overcrowded place,2
this place is not in the same league as see woo and its pricier as well.,3
smack in the middle of chinatown..nice selection of asian vegetables and food.a little pricey though ,3
"loads of nice foods to buy. fruits , vegetables, cakes and noodles",4
superb for all things asian and more besides. very busy and isles narrow so not the place for small children or buggies!,5
great place to find anything asian. a bit too packed.,4
"great selection, can pretty much find any asian foods here. the isles are quite narrow and busy so try not to arrive with a big backpack on",4
good selection of fresh produce,4
great place to buy all kinds of ingredients,4
great for chinese food supplies but beware there is que from hell when you want to pay for your goods.,4
superb chinese supermarket selling everything possible from fresh eels to dried mushrooms. ,5
good selection of chinese groceries. usually a wait for the checkout though. ,4
"very wide selection on south east asian groceries including fruit, veggies, meats and some alcohol. i shop there regularly. recommended.",5
they always have what i need.,5
"great variety of fresh & packaged chinese ingredients, despite always being super busy, the staff are always smiling & incredibly quick to serve you. always loved this place, make sure to pick up a loyalty card!",5
"better than most asian grocery stores in terms of inventory, but still limited selection of japanese products. poor selection of sesame oil, for instance. the meat section stinks something fierce. prices are cheaper than tesco but not as cheap as they used to be. ",4
sometimes can buy some nice meat and fruit from here,5
you can get many things from here.,5
"good, tasty, sizeable portions of food and loved the seaweed. sadly, the food that was served was mostly lukewarm. a little warmth would have made the food taste even better. ",4
if you are stuck in the area and need to visit a chinese supermarket this is a good place to visit but realistically you are probably better off visiting one further out of the city.,4
"i've been to 3 asian supermarkets in china town and i think this one is the best. a great selection of noodles, frozen dumplings and alcohol. ",5
"well stocked oriental supermarket. fresh meat, fish and a a good variety of veg all reasonably priced.",4
everything one might need for chinese cooking.but always very busy,5
"i always shop with them,got good stuffs",4
"terrible staff..ill mannered,unhelpful..esp the ones at meat counter.wont go again...",1
utterly delicious,5
i would love if i could talk to someone in the market to check some receipt tips! really good to find everything you need for a chinese dish.,4
very rude staff,1
a very busy and small but this supermarket is one of a kind. all asian foods and you can have most stuff from here. good costumer service as well....,4
good selection of asian groceries. there's also a chinese butcher which is hard to come by in london.,5
its quite smelly yet you can find almost any asian food here.,4
"always packed, never able to find anyone to help you or answer questions. but it has a ton of products and the prices are very reasonable.",3
"great shop in china town, much to choose from and very affordable. good!!",5
better than it was. prices have become more competitive than they were. service .. there is some now.. that's an improvement. stocks a slightly different range of brands than competitors. we find ourselves in fung a lot more frequently than a few years ago. maybe i'm paranoid but .. the hygiene standard of the butchery could be better.,4
"loon fung tends to be my go to supermarket in chinatown. anything i can't get at lf i pick up at one of the others. it has a good range of fresh produce. the aisles really could do with being wider, so you can move around easier.",4
a busy oriental supermarket with a very diverse stock level,4
not great,1
"food quality was ok, once the order was made and then corrected twice!  then had to send two plates of noodles back as they were cold.  had to ask for a plate for a member of the party so they could actually eat.  extremely poor service standards, and attitude bordering on rudeness.",2
"cold food, cold room, bs staff tried to say food was correct when i pointed something out. i've been going to china town weekly for 40 years your bs does not work. 3 out of 5 on the hygiene.",1
one to avoid. terrible service and takes ages to get any food served. better off heading to wai chai corner further up gerrard street.,1
good food served speedily so could make the theatre on time. reasonably priced,4
unfriendly staff - decent quality food.  no space between tables.  recommend to avoid.,2
"they forgot our order, there was no apology, staff were rude, chucked food down on the table after we chased it up and didn't say a word. all in all not an enjoyable experience and would not recommend.",1
"unfriendly, incompetent waiters",1
"the worst chinese i have gone to in china town, would advice not to go. service slow, staff don't understand english and walk around as if they are dead. the chicken i ordered did not taste fresh, it had a stale taste to it. over all the restaurant did not look clean  stay away even if you are hungry.",1
very delicious food! it's not salty like some other restaurants. it was clean and customer friendly. the stuff answered all our questions. all of the meals were on the table within 10 minutes.,5
this is the worst restaurant in chinatown. actually it's the worst restaurant i have ever eaten in. if i could have given it no stars i would. staff rude and unhelpful. food dreadful. restaurant not clean. do not eat here,1
"lovely dim sum, only disappointment was the wait due to staff shortage.",4
dumplings tasted like not fresh and had been frozen. staff not attentive to anything. wouldnt go back but my experience may not be a common occasion and others may love it.,2
"terrible service, so unfriendly. no smiles, pleases, thank yous, let alone is your food ok? or why did you not want to pay your service charge? - we waited a long time for our food, with no apology for it.  very expensive for average food & extremely poor customer service - do not waste your hard earned money eating here...",1
"if you're very picky about service, then this might not be for you, otherwise the food is amazing. this is our go-to chinese restaurant. my personal favorite - beef brisket noodle soup.",5
good food but a bit rude service. would be 4 stars if staff were nicer,3
good dim sum and lots more seats than it looks like from the window (all 3 floors),4
"first of all i was afraid to choose this place (because just 3,1 stars) but surprisingly everything was good. staff maybe isn't very friendly but polite and attentive that is more than enough to enjoy a dinner. prices are too big but portions were good, fast delivery.",4
"we like slightly scruffy looking places that surprise you with good food. this is one of those. we had dim sum and really liked it. so-so service, but we kind of expected that. good value.",4
"really enjoyed the set menu, food was lovely.  service not as bad as reviews make out. they did forget our prawn crackers though. i left happy",4
service was slow but good. the food portions were decent. the food came out hot and fresh.,5
decent food. special pricing on christmas was a bit unfair. prices were double the normal price. understand its christmas but thats a little outrageous. service was efficient. 20 for fried rice??,2
great food. great customer service.,5
disgusting food. will never come back again. extremely unfriendly staff.,1
delicious food and fast service.,5
"poor quality food, poor service and dining areas filthy not recommended",1
"authentic chinese dining experience with great quality dim sum, but be prepared for your seating to be a little squashed and for decor that needs a revamp. food quality makes up fir the surroundings.",4
they serve really authentic dim sum even from a hong-kongers perspective. gotta try their crunchy custard bun which is well-made. will definitely re-visit next time.,5
"not very flavorful at all, especially for how expensive it is",1
alot of choice and alot of food which was delicious,5
good food at sensible prices. nice location. try a window table.,4
pass off chicken cooked in soy sauce as kung pow chicken  extremely poor. i won't ever go back.,1
i have visited this restaurant in china town a few times and have been happy with the consistent quality of authentic chinese food. one of the very few real chinese restaurants in the china town. not a tourist trap! if you know to order you will not be disappointed. friendly data offering good and courteous service.,4
the service was bad.food was too salty and weird.,1
"pleasant enough place with efficient staff. the food itself was slightly above average for the area. while most of the dishes were fine, the shanghai dumplings were disappointing as their skins were too thick.",4
excellent dim sum but normal dinner is quite expensive.,4
"this restaurant chinese food is average. but the service could have been better.  the waiter put in a wrong order first. the he forgot one of the orders. we also waited a long time just to get some white rice. by the time the rice got here, the other dishes were cold. the waiter didnt pay much attention. may be they just didnt care.",2
best chinese food in london always go here when in london and never dissapoints leaves me wanting to go back weeks later. drooling whilst typing this lol,5
very noisy and staff should smile very bad staff particularly her name is ying,1
average support. food just not tasty as for this price. the sweet and sour chicken was hard. in singapore rice noodles more additives than pasta and in addition too much salt. definitely not recommend!,1
"indifferent customer service. food okay although served on cold plates. service charge included, even though customer service was almost non existent. food hygiene rating only 3 out of 5. poor value overall.",1
unfriendly staff. staff does hardly know any english. the wine we had ordered never came. the roasted duck was salty and more bones than meat. expensive for what they had served. worst chinese restaurant i've ever been at. when we made a remark the guy started arguing... 1 star is too generous,1
"worst chinese in china town, poor service, food purely grease and cold. it is over priced rubbish. when i was there 5 tables arrived and left again staff were pure rude. i wont even feed it to my dog. if i had a choice id give it know stars. stay away.",1
"food is good, great portion sizes!! however the staff aren't particularly friendly or welcoming... was a bit awkward to order because it seemed like they really didn't want to be there  but the food was really good",3
we bought first 20 pounds and then he will have more hand more money,1
"service is lacking, prices too high. won't be visiting again",2
excellent food and service. aaa,5
crispy duck was really nice the main courses were very disappointing. service charge a bit of a joke as good customer service was non existent.,2
"nothing special, just your standard chinese fare. we went for a team lunch. we ordered lots of dim sum to share. good and efficient service and everything went well. just nothing special really.",3
"food was pretty good but i do not think that it justified the price. prices here were definitely on the high side, but the location is inside of china town so it kind of makes sense.",3
decent priced dim sum,4
"food was pretty standard at the time but had stomach upset afterwards, not a good sign. i don't recommend it, there are tons better places around that won't give you food poisoning. i had the sweet and sour chicken.",1
horrible service with disgusting food. will never come back here again. most of the waiters do not speak english and feels like they do not want to serve you at all. waste of money and the evening is ruined.,1
bad food and even worse service.,1
great food and excellent service ,5
standard food and extremely awful service!!!!!! the worst experience in london. never visit again and will not recommend this to anyone who wants to dine here.,1
great dimsum,4
food was good but way too expensive. service was absolutely terrible. we used to come here every couple of months but this was our last time.,2
service non existant... but charged for it....food was okay... nothing special for chinatown... 300ml bottle of chinese beer is 5 quid (after service charge) ..,2
"it was the worst experience. the waiter was very unfriendly and unpolite. my pregnant wife asked for a table away from the ac the waiter said, she should put her jacket on!! the atmosphere of the restaurant was from the beginning not very nice. i would definitely recommend to try another restaurant. its a shame of china town london. :/",1
"this has to be my favorite chinese restaurant ever, i try to get here for lunch whenever i'm up in town. well frequented by chinese nationals is always a great sign. i ate there yesterday and the duck with ginger and pineapple was as tasty as always. treat yourself and make a beeline for this place.",5
our go to place for yum cha (dim sum). great selection of items for not too bad a price. service is better than a lot of chinatown restaurants but dont expect too much.,5
nice meal. service was ok for a busy lunchtime. ideal if you want a leisurely lunch rather than a quick bite.,3
excellent service and food. can't wait to return.,5
overpriced mediocre food. they invited a group of drunk guys in who were loud. the outside is nicer looking than the inside.,2
.wonderful service and food,5
food was nice i did send back two plates off food as i did not want chicken but the lamb meal i orderd was to hot and they was fine about it did not put it on bill i was very picky and staff was really good about it was not rude and understood,5
horrible food. not sure how it's still going,1
"centrally located, fast service, some food is good, some only average. i would recommend the beef brisket soup noodles, it was excellent. price is reasonable. ambience is good, the restaurant serves a variety of locals and tourists, both were treated the same which is good to see. will try the dim sum next time, they looks delish.",4
slightly cramped place particularly upstairs. food is good and reasonably priced. staff is okeyish.,3
amazing selection of dumplings... our favourite chinese place in china town,5
shocked to see such bad reviews. we went a week ago food was amazing and the portion sizes were great. very relaxing atmosphere and great to do some people watching i would definitely recommend and will be going back,4
"good food, but a bit stressful enviorment (part og the experience)",4
"one of the best chinese restaurant in china town. when ordering allways stand and bow with hands together. say "" ha soo"" you will be greeted and treated with much more respect. must recommend the duck 10/10 the beers are quite expensive but then again your paying central london prices. see you soon bruce lee.",5
"lovely food, reasonably priced drinks, fast service. an excellent place for a group get together!",5
excellent dim sum. really enjoyable and super cheap.,5
"terrible place avoid at all costs.take a look at tripadvisor if you dont believe me that this place could be so bad.....it is truley the worst place ive ever eaten, then been sick after. ",2
"dumplings are great, esp. with prawns. there is 12% service charge.",3
food was too greasy... poor service...,1
do not pay with contactless here.,1
"tried to call to make reservation and encountered the worst telephone manner ever. if that's how they are with customers wanting to make reservation, i can't imagine what poor service they provide for dining customers.",1
"bad service, really stressed out waitresses. we had a table just beside the dishes that where really noisy. the food was ok at the best and extremely over priced! avoid this place at all cost! ",1
"food was ok but not great, service brought things which were not ordered",2
beautiful as always,5
i tend to believe it is a bit expensive and if you want to enjoy a quiet time to not be kicked out sooner you finished - then avoid to go between 5pm - 9pm.,3
one of the best places for dim sum in london. n.b. service is average,5
i always feel like i'm back in hong kong whenever i come here.,4
3.80 for a small cup of cold rice says it all :),1
just terrible !,1
worst customer service ever will not be back again for sure,1
a great dim sum restaurant with very nice staff been coming here for years and never had a bad dish,5
fantastic venue for dim sum with chums,5
do not eat here. food disgusting and raw...,1
pretty authentic and well made dim sum.,4
the worst place i have ever eaten in. ,1
tip: go get dim sums for lunch! ,5
nice dim sum,4
worst service ever. they took 20 minutes after placing the order to tell me that they didn't have barbeque meat. that's all i ordered! never again.,1
"the food is fair, but the service is terrible",2
all dishes are overlooked while cold. the quality is low with poor service. make sure they repeat what you have ordered otherwise you will be surprised when you see the dishes,1
"great, yum!!!",4
not a very good buffet. the meat was dry,2
can confidently say this was the worst meal i have ever had in my entire life and this is coming from a person who has had food poisoning 3 times. ,1
the foods tasted the same as those in hong kong. the environment is quite nice and clean. it is a little bit pricey though.,4
friendly staff and some quality chinese food.  the g1 menu for two fed us very well,4
really great dim sum,4
"tricky price outside, it shows 5,5 pounds for grilled duck rice, but somehow they will inform you, it's 7,8 pounds in the evening...",1
underrated!,5
"food was ok, but hugely overpriced for the quality. no dim sum at the time we went, even though it was advertised in the window...  and the rudest staff i've ever encountered. i certainly won't be going back here ever again.",2
super expensive for average experience. paid 11 for a beer!,1
there dim sum is a must. especially the one with peanut and hoi sin sauce (can't remember the name but love the food),4
great food and good price,4
disgusting,1
"dim sums are decent but slightly inconsistent, with the siu mai being a particular highlight. service is quite typical for a chinese restaurant, being busy and efficient ratger than welcoming, so don't expect tpp notch services. for a place for dim sum however, this is definitely a place worth considering in chinatown.",4
worst restaurant  in london,1
really good dumplings,4
great late night noodle stop (go for crab or brisket!),4
"actully quite nice, its good standard. enjoy dim sum a lot and we go there with friends alot.",4
excellent satay chicken skewers and spring rolls and the best duck curry i have ever tasted,5
tasty.  great services and reasonable price,5
"worst service ever. i ordered two dishes for me and my wife. mine came first and the other one never made it before i finished my own one. i asked a few times to chase it, eventually we cancelled the order and left. when we left the place, i saw number of chiefs just smoking outside, not preparing dishes for customers. ",1
over priced crispy chilli beef 11.20 for that and its soggy complete rip off,1
"we are here on christmas eve 2015, the food was ok, service was ok, but when we got home that evening i felt nauseous, but luckily wasn't sick, felt better the next morning, my wife however had diarrhoea all day. maybe a i've off but i'm afraid i just wouldn't risk rating here again.",1
flavourless food - the main dishes were nearly inedible. will never return.,1
excellent,5
sat upstairs and got dim sum. was very nice and came back. also works out much cheaper than you initially expect so win win.,5
"superb dim sum (served at lunchtime only i believe). i really don't get the bad reviews here, was excellent on my visit and i want to go back soon! ",5
"great staff, ok food.  but reasonable prices.  the floors are a bit sticky too.",4
the food here is amazing (i recommend the three meat roast). this place is always busy and for very good reason the staff are great although a little stressed at busy periods (helpful and nice all the same).,5
"the food was very low quality, vegetables had no flavour to them and the noodles were dry.service was also terrible. our food came at different times, and the waitress just kind of dumped it on the table and walked off without a word.",1
not too bad a place to get your midnight eats,3
"wanted to bring our 15 yr old on a chinatown experience in london as we are international travellers, very rude staff unless you are chinese don't seem to want to know you, would not go back again",1
the food is delicious.a world taste of chinese food.,4
"if i could put 0 stars, i would. terrible food.i'm sick of it how the food is awful, plesse avoid it!",1
"pretty good beef ramen, also a very nice variety of dim sum. unfortunately the chef made a mistake and made us the incorrect dish but it also tasted nice. ",4
"basic but tasty lunchtime special of meat and rice (you can chose what type of meat), tho no veg, at a very reasonable price.",3
good place to eat!,5
we had an amazing lunch here. ordered about 8 or 9 dishes between 3 of us,4
"great staff, great food, reasonable prices.",5
good quality chinese food at reasonable prices for london.,4
"amazing authentic food, staff is quite rushy",5
the best food and dim sum in chinese town. ,5
"i always visit here if i'm in china town, the best crispy duck great prices",5
better than expected - will be back for dim sum for sure.,5
"good service, dodgy grub. steer clear, there are better options",1
"man kann dort essen, es ist geschmacklich in ordnung, man kann`s aber auch sein lassen. das personal htte auch freundlicher sein knnen. die sanitren anlagen sind ein graus.",2
waiters hover about too much.,1
excellent food excellent service friendly staff highly recommended,5
the set menus are good value and a much nicer alternative to the buffet type set ups in the area. you also can get a pint of lager which seems quite uncommon in most other places in the area.,5
"don't order two meals and two starters for two people, there will be enough for 5!!",4
i found the rice to be to undercooked starters and mains arrived at the same time and the beer was flat. there is a lot of choice in chinatown will find somewhere else next time.,2
"i ate dim sum at around 4 pm, so your experience during the busier later hours might wary! the staff was quite quick in my experience, and they also kept answering whatever questions i had about the food whenever i called them to my table.the food was also super delicious.pretty sure they forgot about my sauce, though..",4
horrible service and so so slow even when they are empty it took 45 minutes for some dumplings for 2 people. :( they were delicious but horrible service and wait times. (i've been twice and can confirm it wasn't a fluke),1
not so clean. wouldn't risk it.,3
"mass produced food for profit, no interaction by staff, food very bland. not worth the money and premises in need of refurbishment.",1
food ok but nothing special compare to some other restaurants in china town.,3
"nothing special, standard chinese food",4
very good dim sum place is a bit quirky but great food,3
"really awfull. the terrible food was only surpassed by the horrible service. i have never experienced worse service anywhere in the world. we had five different dishes and they were all undercooked, overcooked or simply missing any taste.",1
"did not like the food. had some stomach issues after eating there. the staff does not speak english,  so you can ask about the dishes and make your choice.  will not return here again.",1
"terrible service, they bring us food which we didn't order. we ordered few vegetarian dishes and all tasted terrible (even rice).",1
"deseptive, its at least three floors high. very busy, large portions, big menu, fast service and reasonable prices.",4
good and quick service. good food.,5
really good dim sum.   peking duck average.  quick service but barely polite,3
excellent all round ,5
"serve very bad,food too expensive,only rice 6 pounds.no more next time!",1
"it was my go to chinese in chinatown, but i have just got back to mine with a very funny tummy :(  do  not order the salt and pepper chickenalso i think its gotten a bit more expensive. service as you would expect in chinese tbh",2
interior was a but old.dimsum was very good. the duck and cha sieuw with pork was served cold. but flavour was good.,3
i ordered food they brought me the wrong food then told me that he didn't have the food i ordered when i said i didn't want that food and i wanted to leave it said i have to pay for the food rude staff very disappointing,1
great food and really kind and supportive staff.,5
average food. good place for a private chat as most of the staff can't understand english. she followed me from the w lounge.,3
"food is not even average, duck had a lot of fat, the rice was not anything special, and the prices are quite high for the quality. avoid, there are many other great options around.",1
"such impolite and rude waiters, one of then didn't listen to me when i was asking questions about the menu, he got pissed and start to say ""oh my god"". i love chinese food and the restaurant is lovely but we are still shocked about the rude ambiance ....",1
a pleasant and convenient stop to eat before the theatre.,5
worst chinese food ever. unfriendly staff overprised and absolutely tastefree,1
"this is mine and my friends go-to place if we want to have a big and cheap chinese meal! service is typically chinese, if you have been to china you know what i mean. the food is amazing and it always comes fast and hot! this restaurant does not disappoint at all! authentic chinese food for reasonable price!  ",5
the food was cold and tasteless ... i will not mention the toilet,1
had a lovely dim-sum meal with a very big selection of food!worth going once with a very big group of friends! very friendly waiters :),3
avoid! i wouldn't even give this place a star if it would be possible. the worst duck i have ever had. rice was completely without any sauce and the duck was just bones and fat.,1
"came here for lunch and had the lunch special: 3 types of roast meat with rice (roast pork, bbq pork, and roast duck). service was quick and the portion was huge. would definitely come here for lunch again. ",5
"currently our favourite restaurant in chinatown (gerrard st., london) for dim sum. always freshly cooked (though no trolly - select by tick list :photo & english). great value. fully recommend. ",4
dim sum was nice but not served hot. also dont order their taro coconut milk dessert its not real taro :/,3
"delicious food, unpleasant service.",3
"distinctly average. between the two of us 50% of our food was pretty tasty (if a tiny bit cold), but the other 50% was not at all good. avoid the barbecued meat dish unless you like fatty inedible cuts of pork on plain cold rice.",2
"decent dim sum, similar standard and prices to nearby places. was disappointed to see shark fin on the menu, highly unethical and wasteful practice. should not be encouraged.",3
"with many similar chinese restaurants on the main street, this one just about stands out. authentic food with delicious dim sum. service can vary but is always quick. can be quite crowded sometimes with long queues. i would probably avoid the busy peak times during dinner",4
great dim sum and reasonable price!,4
less than aversge. choose another place.,2
we went there for a business meeting and we're not disappointed by either quality and selection of food we were served or the friendliness and level of service we received from the staff. highly recommended,5
"not great, food was greasy, golden dragon across the road is slightly more expensive but it is a lot better than lotus garden...",1
authentic chinese food at reasonable prices.,5
"busy buffet in a central location, feels small. upstairs and downstairs dining areas. fairly standard choice of food well presented and tasty. staff good and prices reasonable for the location. would go back if i were to visit the area again.",4
busy but excellent value for decent food,4
"really nice food, good environment and welcome chinese",5
price is quite honest for the offer. anyway poor choose and very fatty chops of meat.,3
best value soho eat all you want fixed price. biggest selection of traditional chinese meat and veg options. can be very busy eith large parties nefore theatre time.. large capacity. friendly staff. regular meal.out for me for many years.,4
it is okay for a quick meal if you are hungry.,3
nice food but they put a service charge on with out advertising on the windows,3
very good food in there for main and starters but sadly very poor for dessert but thsn i mainly go for dinner very good for price and how many there is,5
always a good selection of freshly prepared hot food... still running their slick and good value operation after many years in soho... would always recommend... ,5
i love this place eat as much as you like 10 95p xx,5
"all you can eat 10.95 chinese food loads of choice , would recomend & return",5
"food ok , cash only and 10% service charge on top of bill. also no draught beer all out of cans, coca cola served out of 2 litre bottle. plenty of other choices in area . shop around i will next time",1
"decent enough selection. most of the choices were rather bland. not bad, just very little flavor. personally, i expect chinese food to have some decent flavor. if you prefer bland, give it a shot.",3
all you can eat buffet. quality of food is average but if you are really hungry and can eat 5 plates of food it is worth the price. i paid 12 and ate 4 plates of food.,3
"the food has to be the worst chinese food i have ever had! i was with a large party so did not want to make a fuss, but it was really really bad. you have been warned, pay a bit extra elsewhere for something that at least will be edible. the best part of the meal was some tinned prunes - gives you some idea.",1
"it's a chinese buffet in a china town-london.it offers several dishes in a cheap price.but, it's just a cheap price.overall dishes are so oily.",3
totally fine. slightly lukewarm food and hanging a sign in the window but the higher price they'll charge you sneakily by the till leave a bit of a bad taste in the mouth.,3
"got so sick after eating there!  i went to the toilets and i ve seen  how dirty it is , it was worst than the public toilets you find in a park or train station! i won't go back there ever again!",1
not impressed with the food at all,2
"good was ok, but could have been better.",3
eat as much as you like and tasty,5
prices are good but the food is not really really good.,3
"my girlfriend and i went they're today. after we ate we soon began to feel sick. after 4 pain relief tablets, 8 hours of time both of us still have a lot of pain and the need to vomit. overpriced, low quality",1
nice food and reasonably priced,5
if the food had been a little warmer it might have been a lot better. it was cheap for central london but not exciting. i will not be visiting again.,2
good value,4
"if i could give this 0 stars i would. the food is flavourless and dry, the egg fried rice is cold and the noodles taste like plastic. for the taste of the food it is so overpriced. i would never come back here again, massively disappointed would not recommend.",1
"dont not give them any tips....look at the total cost...they add the tips in.....u getting your food  ""walking up & down the stairs"" , and still asking for the service charge..... unbelievable",1
"very nice restaurant. service was good. toilets are downstairs. only downside is if you are seated downstairs you have to walk up, get food then go back down.",4
"foul, dry, tasteless, poor quality, too salty, cold. these are just some words to describe the food without being too insulting. looks great from outside but please avoid like the plague. it's disappointing discusting and must be shut down.",1
great flavors and lots of choice.,5
not as bad as people say. the staff was really nice. the food wasn't that bad. maybe not as tasty as we could expect it to be and some times the food is a bit cold. try it for yourself! it really isn't that bad!,3
"there was good variety of food and the staff were very nice and prompt, but it felt very crampt, especially having to go to and from the buffer, we found ourselves bum brushing on people's tables, not nice for them, and there was a minimal selection for the dessert, although the jelly was very interesting and tasty",3
miss charged. dont look st the price on the window this is incorrect. food was luke warm greasy as sin and left with a lovely film on my tongue. will never return,1
"10.95 on a saturday lunch time, chinese buffet so you can go back again, good choice of dishes , fresh prawns used in the paella/rice dish bill for four adults with 3 soft drinks and 1 glass of wine was 58",4
i m really surprised for negative feedback ...is very busy  and full filled buffet ...they are  serving really good dishes for 11 pound...they must to open an other restaurant .,5
gorgeous food & a really good selection of dishes staff attentive but not invasive the restaurant was clean as were the facilities there's also a lower floor to the restaurant for those who don't find the stairs an issue l would definately recommend this restaurant,5
not enough space... food not great,1
nice all you can eat in chinatown.,4
niceee,4
only recommend to go there if your tastebuds are dead. if they're not then they will be after eating here,1
"i have been to this place several times, food is always fresh and delicious but unfortunately the staff are very unprofessional, unprepared, and most of the time rude.",4
cheap but low grade greasy food offered,2
"very fast and good service, we were seated immediately and served. there is quite a variety of choose to choose from. my favorite is egg fried rice and sweet & sour pork.. delicious",5
nice food ,5
good food in good price. but the stuff isn't polite. they are seeing you as pounds.,4
"it's okay. if you're really hungry, you can definitely get value for money here, but the food isn't amazing. the staff can vary between incredibly friendly and incredibly rude for no obvious reason. most of all, i'm not sure why they add a service charge to your bill. it's a buffet. you do 70% of the table service yourself.",3
for the price the foods ok but the seating crowded and up stairs seeting is extremely hard to get,2
"good food, appreciated.",4
disgusting greasy umedible food that is stone  cold... stay away!!!,1
value for money buffet in a busy cramped restaurant with dirty toilets & no toilet paper. service charge is added onto the bill which is ridiculous.,3
"cheap and cheerful chinese buffet in soho, what more could you want? pretty similar to any if the other chinese buffets in china town.",5
"fair, food a little salty. but staff are fine.",4
the food ok but the treatment of the staff very bad and apart they charge the tip in the account but the treatment of the horrible staff,1
"full of deep-fried frozen foods. considering the quality of foods, the price is not even reasonable.",2
"good fresh food, great variety of chinese cuisine. peaceful, the service does not rush the customers. quiet, comfortable to sit, dine and have a conversation. spacious. highly recommended. good price of 10.95 per person, plus 10% table service. big pot of tea 1 gbp.",5
"friendly, loads of choices, delicious foods. i will return again.",5
very good and fresh food.,5
songs of the good was cold,3
very very good!,4
"decent food , cheap in central london",3
"i go with  my  family  for  years  , we love  the  food",4
nice food and variety! tasty!,4
"absolutely disgusting food. extremely poor quality, cold, tough ribs and generally a very tasteless. its also expensive not a great variety of food. this place should be shut down. don't go. be warned.",1
better than most of the chinese places i've been. worth it! ,4
i've been there and after i ate the food i started to feel really sick. never again.also the staff is not that nice.,1
quite cramped. food nice. can be long queues. don't pile your plates up. just go back again. polite staff.,4
"nice place, food was good. got a table very quickly and staff were polite.",5
terrible food was freezing. they watch you eat. terrible customer service. food was horrible.  96 for 6 people to sit for 10 minutes,1
idk why but this is my favourite buffet in soho.,4
cheap and almost cheerful,5
"very delicious food, great prices and beautiful place!",5
"barely any taste in the food. trash, go somewhere else",2
bad quality food and quite salty.,1
good value,3
terrible food. very small selection of food.,1
very average to poor food,2
fairly good service,4
"disappointing, oily flavourless noodles. rice looked unappetising, meat choices were quite nice. expected a higher standard in this area.",3
"really big disappointment, everything overcooked, dry meat. even sweet&sour sauce was just sour sauce. total waste of money. all you you can eat, but i couldn't even finish my initial plate... service not very friendly.",1
so many tasty food for a very good price,5
basic and service pretty much non existent. if you love all your foods deep fried in batter and coated in sugar syrup then this is the place for you. 10.95 per head.,3
"excellent food at great prices, especially for london",4
food is tasty and relatively varied,3
it's ok. i have had much better. too few meat options. price is quite low but i am not sure i would go again. meat parcels in singapore sauce was good.,3
"this chinese restaurant wasn't that great, the food was dry and unappealing. and there was bugs in my drink.",2
nice food.,4
extremely rude staff. doesnt even deserve 1 star.,1
nice food good value for money,3
"below average , with terrible service",2
don't eat the wingsevand the toast. there to dry.  but if you don't want to get drunk eat here....,3
"quality buffet, best in china town",5
not up to mark.did not enjoy at all.,1
"luke warm food, hardly any left in the containers at 6pmnot worth the money",1
"as buffets go this ranks right up there wide choice on offer, good wine hit and miss thou as to whether the dishes are hot, warm or cold but when they do get it right the three stars i gave become four  desserts i would give them a miss thus back to three.",5
"worst chinese buffet ever, and ive tried a lot. i would have put no stars if i could. you get cold food little choice of dishes, warm beer, flat coke and  obligatory service charge even though you receive no service. i wouldnt feed my dog this rubbish",1
"okay buffet food. nothing special, but not bad either",3
not bad- good to grab a bite and run. i was there for 10 minutes. could probably use a better selection of food- and have it refreshed more often.,3
"food is good, service could be more welcoming, check your bill - we been there few times and a few mistakes",4
nice place. good variety. the duck is delicious! the prawns always a bit salty.,4
very fu*kin bad food,1
"excellent buffet, loads of option. value for money",5
decent cheap buffet. however i had an upset stomach after eating here.,1
nice food but space is small and no deserts available. otherwise ok.,4
"poor food quality, dining area downstairs smells of toilets, bad customer service and uncomfortable environment",1
"loved it!!!great choice of food, quick and efficient. all food was hot and tasty. queues out the door, must be doing something right. i think people who have given bad reviews need to get a reality check, it's an 8:95 buffet not silver service!!!!",5
mr woo we love you !we had a woo-nderful time,4
"the food is not very good and the service is one of the worse i have experienced. unfriendly, agressive when you ask for something, they treat you like nothing. not even goodbye when you say so. avoid avoid !!!",1
a lot of to choose,5
the food was ok could of been hotter instead of luke warm,3
food good reasonable price. good selection of drinks. shame no ice cream for desert.,4
"simple, loads of food and 10.50 excl see charge. fills you up good",5
terrible food terrible service,1
10.95 + 1.10 mandatory service charge per head for the all-you-can eat buffet. but you'll find it imposible to stomach much of the flavourless and luke warm strands of meat around bones. there are many other restaraunts around piccadilly circus that are better,1
"for 11.00 pretty decent. food was good, but a bit greasy. lots of fat.",4
"this is your basic all you can eat chinese buffet. around 10 each, but they add a 10% service charge. the food is ok, lots of options and free tap water if you ask. ",3
"great value for london, good selection of food however some standards were missing on our visit fried chicken balls and chicken and cashew nuts to name two.",5
even if it is most expensive from other buffets in china town and they charge for service but definitelly they serve the best food in that area,5
"great selection of east asian food, but sometimes you need to wait for food to arrive.  staff is informative and friendly. if you want to get full and like sweet and sour,  this is the place. ",4
went to mw all u can eat buffet  had a bottle of water with the meal and was charged 5 for the water please check the price of the drinks before ordering,1
nice..m,4
great food! the waiting queues could get really long during lunch and dinner.,5
"chip price! but you get what you pay for. chewy food, rude staff, dirty toilet. service charge in the bill..for what? it's a buffet. shocking food and no manners at all! never back again.",1
"so bad! water from the tap and i paid for that, cold food, bad rice, not good quality. don't go it's not worth.",1
really great food. eat as much as you can. take some doggy-bags and fill them up but don't let the staff catch you. they will kill you and cook you and eat you. be careful,5
the starters and mains were good but i have had better and a wider range in other parts of the country. the roast duck was nice. the desserts however were atrocious oranges were bitter and the jelly desserts were vile. toilets were passable but didnt like the 10% service charge.,3
"good choice of food,friendly staff..no problems..happy",5
"walked in expecting a decent buffet, it looked tasty from the outside.  apart from the lemon chicken there was absolutely nothing tasty about it.  everything else was bland, and the sweet and sour sauce was disgusting, nothing sweet about it whatsoever,piss poor dessert selection.",1
not great .staff are very cold. not expensive,1
"i personally don't like how they arranged my seat, there were few more 2-seat table on first floor but they brought us to very very corner at downstair that facing the wall, i don't mind if first floor was full then. taste was expected as not delicious so my rating was based on my experience and their hospitality.. ",2
it's your average chinese buffett reasonably priced and a medium selection of food. i've had a much wider selection elsewhere but it did ok. ,3
very good food service not great very dark down stairs.,4
"very inexpensive, with a massive variety of freshly made buffet food! ",5
pretty good food. not great though.,3
so so food. not the best in chinatown but you can fill up. fast rotation on waitingline.,3
wouldn't even give it a star if i could everything cold part from 2 dishes would recommend no 1 would ever come hear might be cheep but it shows in there food only got thing if had was soup and that wasn't the best would not recommend,1
"food is mediocre, very salty and poor lighting in the basement. priced similar to other buffets in the area.",2
"food luke warm, tasteless, and overall lack of options. i at least expect the food to be cooked to a standard that's edible and hot",1
"the food is fine for the price, but salty. this is not gormet eating but filling your boots on a budget. good choice on the buffet.",4
fair,3
- food was too cold- food did not taste very good- variety is okay- 10 % service charge- price is okay 12 ,2
all you can eat chinese at low prices,4
"good value for the price but nothing special, if you have a big appetite, this is the place to go to.",4
accept credit cards without extra charge. small fast food buffet. more seating available in the basement. ,5
a decent selection of food at a very affordable price.,4
food food great price for central location,5
great food green tea 2 give it free with the meal,5
always have a lovely meal here.,5
"quite good for the price, maybe one of the best buffet in the aera",3
good buffet. not the general run of the mill food,5
food could have better,2
"the best china buffet in london for my opinion, recommended.",4
good value for the heart of london x,4
friendly staff however avoid at rush hour or you will feel the warm welcome vanish within 5 minutes and the need for you to move on by the staff more evident but as i said the staff are friendly and the price is good for what you get.,3
not recommended price for outside door is not the price what is charged in final employees speak very nasty and not give receipt...... food s not fresh.....,1
"dirty tables, cold food, dirty cutlery, dirty plates not sure if i felt ok after eating",1
very reasonable price for the self service buffet. quick friendly service. will definitely come again,4
"cheap but low in quality, still better than the ones around",3
there are no knives,3
food is delicious,5
went on here for a cheap eat 12 for the meal then service charge them 5 for a bottle of water please check before you order the toilets were dirty no soap and no toilet roll i'm told when i complained they get checked once every night great,1
best one in  the west end just get one  drink,5
if there is something less than a star then i would rank it. very awful and disappointing food and service. initially you think its cheap but you endup paying more than what you expect. very disgusting toilet and also dirty resturant. bad experience and will never pass its street even again,1
good variety and nice food right in the centre of things.,5
great choice from the buffet. all delicious. toilets downstairs.,5
"we were seated quickly, eventually served for a drink then not seen again.  food & drinks were very average, not worth the money.  they automatically added 10% tip which i didnt pay.  wouldnt go again ",3
brilliant food,5
this was the cheapest buffet we could find in the area.  it is busy and popular  food is good and freshly made and continuously replenished and there is a reasonably large choice. there is a large dining area in the basement.  i don't know why these buffets charge 10% service when there is none really.,4
great place for a quick lunch or early dinner,5
cold food and at the end service charge added to my bill. without table service.,1
"good food, diverse, nice staff",5
"one of the best chinese buffets i have ever been to. no complaints, only praise here",5
"very bad food and unclean restaurant, i dont recommend it to any one. also staff very rude and un polite. toilets were very dirty. prices are much higher than what they say initially.",1
is ok,3
simple british chines buffet. nothing real chines just the british taste and favorite.,3
food was cold.although lots of dishes not enough decent food. disappointed,1
excellent value for money. don't expect any airs and graces. but food is great and not expensive and they let our 4 year old eat for free.,5
there's a good variety of food and all so tasty,5
"very bad food all fried and very dry, refused to grant discount to my 10 year old chlld. we we refused to pay service charge we were told that we were not welcome and to never come back.",1
food was not very fresh. all of th fruits are canned,2
"my wife love it, tofu is her favorite. i personally really would like to see some sweet and sour chicken there, but when you mix lemon chicken with some sweet and sour sauce it gets closer to that taste... so basically we are coming there to eat only tofu and prawns :) nice people working there, very polite and kind.",5
great food a well priced. staff friendly and polite,4
our favourite buffet place... love it,4
m &  m heaven ... but not much else,3
for quick meal it was okay,3
worth a try,5
"ok food, ok services",3
avoid at all costs! cons: expensive cold food raw food rude staff pint of heineken comes out of a can buffet selection is tiny  hidden charge for tip/gratuitypros: near the hospital,1
not the best buffet selection. definitely not disabled friendly (narrow entrance and corridor and main eating area downstairs). downstairs area is quite dark and the 'caves' are too warm.,3
"poor food, poor wine",1
great place:)),5
"cheap lunch, same goes for service and food quality. you get what you pay for.",2
"staff were nice, but that was about it. food wasn't great, cheap price for london but tasteless/chewy food.",2
"awful. food was cold and stale, didn't enjoy any of it.",1
the best chinese buffet,5
"well, the staff is... and the food good",3
food is horrible and not variety! ground floor is too hot. im dissappointed with the food as its not good as before,1
"food is ok. the price it puts on window says 10.95 pounds, but they will charge you one more pound for the tip without informing in advance.",1
ok. looked clean. all deep fried.  no ice cream ,3
nice food. reasonable price.,5
wide variety of food but taste not great,1
verry good food and perfect location :),5
variety. good turn over so food does not get  too much steamed.,4
great delicious food!!!,5
good food here thou the last two visits the food has been cold or like warm.  also the 10% food service charge added to your bill automatically when your being watched and feeling uncomfortable when going for food or leaving the table.   the service has not met my expectations of a 10% service charge.,2
"cold food, flat beer, flat cola..",1
not bad at all and cheap,4
"very hectic and loud, bad food.",1
"food was terrible , just about ate one plate of food . it's cold and nasty , like it's been reheated . dessert bar is pointless unless u like prunes  .",1
tasteless and greasy food. the service was good though.,1
i will never eat here again. food tasted stale. staff were not friendly,1
"very good prices! a good food,clean,with kind staff",4
worst buffet ever. i'm very disappointed,1
gets more expensive everytime i go there.,4
cheap buffet.decent food..not bad for the price. don't expect 5 star food for 1 star prices.,4
they food is good but unfortunately i can't  say the same about the staff.,1
food wasn't good,2
"agree with the other reviews. aggressive staff, poor and tepid food. way overpriced. avoid.",1
"wide choice of chinese meals, reasonable price",5
great buffet at this price,5
excellent service and dishes.,5
food disgusting... waste of money!,1
"would never go again!. food was cold and the people who run the buffet are so rude, then put a tip on my payment. i asked the man at the front why i had to pay if no one was  serving me. all he did was  laugh and pulled my money out of my hand and gave me my change. will never go again! ",1
not nice at all,1
as buffets go  mw buffet is a nice place with a good selection of food. the desert section could do with a bit of variety as it looks unappealing. the staff were a bit rude and we did feel rushed out the door with the bill placed on the table once we had one plate and we were going to order more drinks but decided not to and to go.  ,2
"food is okay, service is simple; it is a buffet.",3
food was disgusting. staff is realy rought. there are is no chicken at all. i am really disapointet. nevar go there.,1
disgustingly oily and bland food. plates and glasses have a film of grease as well. we left feeling ill and will definitely never return. ,1
perfect,5
"you won't feel proud for going here, but you will feel full.",3
lovely staff but the afternoon buffet was luke warm to cold. we paid full price for the buffet for 3 people but only managed to eat 2 spoonfuls each. food tasted horrible. the place is dusty and dirty.  would not recommend this place to anyone.,1
a good meal as always.,5
"really not worth the money. rude staff and hidden expenses put on the bill afterwards. disgustingly dirty toilets which are ""cleaned often"" and very average food, at best.avoid.",1
"definitely waste of money, food was not tasty, very dirty place, toilet looks like recycling point.",1
"we caught up with some long unseen family here for lunch. no one had any issues with the food, although service was a bit spotty. beyond that, it's what you expect from a deal buffet. it won't make your dreams come true, but it'll take that tenner and make it count by filling you up.",3
good food! can't get enough of the shrimps!,4
not a good selection ....plus the food was bad,1
i wanted to give it zero stars but wouldn't give me the option the food was terrible the choice off food was a joke and i hope you don't need to go to the toilet because it was like going down an alley absolutely disgusting!!!,1
"waste of money. one star is so much,dirty pleace.",1
"beggars belief how bad this 'restaurant' is. i dont expect much from buffet's but the standard of food and service here is utterly, utterly appalling. i will never be back.",1
"i went there yesterday. i find the food is ok, but i do not think it is fair to get charge service charge.",4
went in for the buffet it was all vegetables and very little chicken in the curry when we went to pay there was aldo a 20% service charge i did not find it good value for money,1
"don't even ask. food was soggy and oily as hell. i'm sorry to say it was a disappointment by all means, not even the price (+10% service charge?) gets this more than a single star.",1
average food at best.,3
good location,3
"warning bells should have been ringing when we were made to pay before even being able to see the food. food was vile, not much to choose from at all. also had to walk down lots of stairs to get to the toilet. definitely would not recommend.",2
good food and in budget,3
you get what you pay for let's leave at that,3
just wow...,5
insect beatle on the table when eating are food do not go  there should be closed down.,1
"disgusting food, most dry and old, lemonade is a sprite (?) with lemon ... definitely not recommend !!!",1
shame can't leave no stars or minus one stars as it's a health hazard,1
best buffet in town!,5
"unique flavours from the philippines and other filipino deserts such as ube brownie, buko pie and halo-halo. excellent service and a clean environment.",4
mega wer etwas anderes probieren mchteawesomewho want like to experience other's tastes of ice-cream this place ist the placetobe to taste pilipino ice-cream ,4
"first time there, i got hola hola and it was amazing. customer service was great too :)",5
"the ube flavoured shake was really good and proper sweet. it was thick and heavy so could only finish half the cup, yummy nonetheless. the stuff are very helpful and lovely too.",4
had the ube bilog. it was very very nice.,5
"we were at this place for the first time. i was surprised that even though it was recently opened, there were a lot of people there and a lot of guys who always came.  good luck and thanks",5
it's really good,5
"good, but a bit overpriced for its own version of halo-halo.",3
very delicious halo halo,5
lovely selection of ice cream to choose from,5
yummy donuts and milshakes!!,4
lovely dessert,5
"my favorite place in london. omg one weekend, i've been twice there... love the ube ice cream ",5
go here for the ube ice cream in the milk bun. so good i had 2 in one day and will be returning later today for another :d oh and weekend donuts!,5
the binong are great,5
"tasty snack, i'll be back for the milo i've cream.",4
"i arrived the second they opened, dying to eat their famous burnt coconut icecream. they hadn't finished making it so i patiently waited and in return for my loyalty they offered it to me in the house! so that was crazy sweet.  plus now i'm obsessed with this ice cream, it was incredibly delicious!!",5
a filipino ice cream/dessert place in chinatown. this is like my comfy place in london where i get to eat my favorites,5
amazing place to try unique ice cream. the calamansi juice is sooooo refreshing. even in the middle of winter!,5
"great desserts, the ube shake was really good.",5
"the guyabano ice cream (no dairy though, great for vegan or lactose intolerant folks) teleports me to my childhood. its so good and fresh  :,)",5
"amazing authentic filipino dishes/dessertscannot recommend this place enoughsmall and cozy, with affordable prices",5
so yummy! the ube ice cream cake was really nice. it was really busy though and barely enough seats but i think that it was worth it! a bit pricey.. especially for what it is. but its got a really cool vibe about it so its a fun place to go!,4
"very busy and it seemed like only half the staff were doing anything so it was very slow. the flavours arent really my thing so it was quite sickly, really more an instagram opportunity than a desert i would rush back for",2
it's a nice ice cream especially the ube ube ice cream is a must try flavour of ice cream they also have ube bilog which is their best seller i recommend it to anyone who was looking for good dessert place.,4
best filipino ice cream especially if you wanna try ube! halo-halo is a must try!,4
feels like home. they serve the best philippine ice cream in london :d they have bilog and halohalo.,5
"you can find authentic filipino desserts here, you can find it a little bit pricey but its all worth it. the ube and queso ice cream was the best with also the bilog which is ube ice cream inside a warm pandesal bun.",5
"is a little cool store, full with history and sweetness. the attention was polite and the treat in point, good presentation and flavor.",5
amazing dessert place. would recommend the ice creams,4
"first shop in london that i have tried halo-halo!  and its good, except for the ice they are using. because theyre quite big. but the ube ice cream is soooo good and cheap price as well.",5
loved it! the ube bilog is amazing,5
"very pretty deserts and drinks and for that i give them 2 points. the seating area is nicr as well. however, we did not enjoy it at all and all the various deserts we tried we could not have after the first few morsels.perhaps it requires a different pallet",2
i had the bilog with chocolate ice cream. i definitely recommend it.,5
authentic filipino food thats done with a twist and unique way. its as good as it looks. noticed its always busy because it must be really good. having said that though they move line pretty well with a system.,5
"everything from this cafe is amazing, make sure to get the ube bilog and ube shake!",5
"pricey but amazing philipino desserts, the taro (ube) ice cream is amazing.",4
"having never tried bilog before, i was entirely blown away by how soft and warm the milk bun was. it went really well with the ube ice cream i got.",5
"nice vibe, milo ice cream with a milk bun was nice. a bit too sweet for my liking, seating is a bit tough. i'd say priced 50% higher than real value, good nevertheless.great music.",4
"magical ice cream. it was great to try something from the philippines, something not as commonly found as your normal ice cream scoop. the staff was awesome and the shop is so cute!",5
well worth experiencing dirty ice cream! i had a fantastic coconut variety. reasonable price and good service.,5
"not your usual ice-cream parlour. unique flavours from the philippines and other filipino deserts such as ube brownie, buko pie and halo-halo. excellent service and a clean environment. would definitely recommend if in chinatown looking for something different!",5
the ice cream was outstanding! i had the purple potato and charcoal coconut. both delicious!,5
"love mamasons, they really know how to utilize ube and i would highly recommend the bilog as a lovely post dinner treat.",4
"overall great ice cream, with their speciality flavors being purple ube and black coconut. the taste is very good but definitely pricey. 4.5 for two modestly sized scoops. seating is plentiful but cramped and the shop can get very crowded. worth a slight detour if you're in the area already.",4
"this ice cream place is very interesting. it's not your usual ice-cream shop. the flavours they offer are quite unique, and the ube bilog is something i was very pleasantly surprised by and would definitely recommend it.",5
"i love this place, it was magical. the ube ice-cream in the middle of november was such an experience! loved it!",5
"amazingggg desserts, especially if youre a lover of ube like me! each dessert was 6.50, the halo halo was good, very filling good for sharing. ube brioche bun was good too! a must try in china town :)",5
"when i miss desserts from home, this is one of the places i go to. though the halo halo should have *more* ingredients, it still tastes like halo halo.i then tried the bilog, and it wasnt too bad, guess the price was a bit much though.it's a small place so it's hard to find a good seat.",5
aesthetic is amazing and wow their bilog was great and the ube ice cream is so great (first time ive ever tried either) id love to return,5
staff were not overly enthusiastic to serve us and prices are a bit high for the products received. not bad but wouldn't rush back.,3
this is a must to try when in chinatown. the price was about 10 if im not mistaken.,5
"nice cosy place for a quick dessert in chinatown! the ube bilog is an absolute must, with a great combination of the warm milk bum and the cold ube ice-cream. (which isn't too sweet!) so delicious! friendly service! would go back again!",5
"sometimes too sweet, but really interesting flavours! ",4
nice ans original. very much on the sweet side though and very filling.,4
my friend and i tried the ube hot chocolate drink and it was unappetising. the cream was lovely but the warm drink under was gross.,3
the ice cream sandwish was deliciousand the halo halo was very nice. would definitely go back.,5
"great customer service, the ube ice cream was too sweet but it was nice. the ube coffee latte was really good too.",3
busy but delicious and worth the wait!,5
"lovely decor, great selection of filipino desserts, great flavours and large portions. guyabano bilog is my summer flavour.",5
pricey...but it was a good one off treat.,5
filipino ice cream flavors on point! so so so good. doesnt get any better than this.,5
"i've had the ube bilog and it was amazing. soft milk bun, toasted and filled with your ice cream of choice (they focus on about 6 flavours)! may look intimating at first but it's well balanced between bun & ice cream, hot and cold and overall yummo.",5
"amazing! friendly staff, brilliant clean and vibrant flavours! my new favourite pudding without the guilty feeling. love it!",5
this ice cream parlour is quite small...and it's popular..so if you want to sit down you may have to wait.  i had the halo halo which was excellent and comparable to ones i have had in the philippines.,5
"very busy,orders being taken but the preparation of the orders not keeping up so long waiting times.",3
the bilog is worth a try!,5
the best delecious ice cream. try coconut flavour   simply the best,5
great deserts quick service and funky interior design.,5
the black coconut ice cream is the best i've ever had,5
coconut ice-cream in a soft hot bun. yum. perfect post wong kei.,5
delicious and unusual philippine ice cream flavours (and a few other treats) served with great charm in a pleasantly unpretentious setting.,5
"im obsessed with ube. ube doughnuts, ube bilog, ube coco, its awesome!",5
"oh my goodness, the ice cream was delicious! already sold out of black cones though so i am going to have to go back",4
food is great but space is very tiny and you can't fully enjoy it due to having to eat standing. pricey. very very busy at some point.,3
"the ube is delicious. very unique ice cream, definitely worth a try",5
"so being a filipino of course my expectations are high. the halo halo they make here is genuinely the best ive had. and im eating all the ube ice cream to make up for distance between here and the phil. i cant stress enough how bloody amazing the ube ice cream is! its a little pricy but man, its so worth it.",5
love the ube icecream!,5
"i love this filipino dessert bar, especially the ube bilog (ice cream filled milk bun) and ube donuts. they do great coffee as well. the place is beautifully decorated and the staff are always friendly.",5
flavors that will rock your head and will not find these flavors anywhere else.  had a taste of things on the menu and will definitely be visiting soon.  loved the fact the deserts were not to sugary.,5
"one of the best dessert places in london, ube bilog and ube brownie are especially excellent!",5
now this was the highlight of my full trip to london. don't miss out the halo halo drink & the bilog. the aftertaste is still on my tongue ,5
"small but niche place, few seating options and staff were clearly very busy but very helpful and patient. although a filipino location the food doesn't represent all filipino food completely. maybe because of some ingredient changes...",4
we went in to try their bilog for the first time and it didn't disappoint! absolutely delicious!,5
loved the milo bilog,5
"nice, but hardly got to try much as machines were not working and ran out of goods. shame really",3
really delicious drinks and icecream,5
lovely little cafe serving really tasty and interesting asian-inspired flavours of ice cream and other desserts/drinks. i tried the bilog bun with ube ice cream which was delicious. and you can ask to taste a little of the flavours if you are unsure!,5
"i enjoyed the dessert and the decor is hip and trendy. their staff were very friendly and accommodating. i will definitely recommend this ice cream cafe to anyone who fancies different exotic flavours such as ube, calamansi and black buko.",5
come here for all things ube (purple yam),4
really interesting asian flavours of ice cream and efficient service. will definitely return to try the other flavours.,5
"i love mamasons, they have the most interesting flavours in london. the kentish town spot is better, but the chinatown location is more convenient. all the flavours are great, and the space is fun, but seating is limited.",5
"great variety of filipino ice cream flavours served in plates made of coconut fibre. tasted yummy, service was good and the shop is lovely!",5
a delicious filipino dessert stop.,4
halo halo is good but a bit western version than the usual filipino taste. a bit expensive.,3
"lovely ice creams, favourite is the black coconut one - best one i've ever had",5
"delicious ice cream, generous space with table and bar seating. friendly staff :)",5
very nice but a bit expensive!,4
the best ice cream for me in london. i just love the coconut charcoal...,5
its a good place to reminisce classic filipino desserts. they retained the classic taste but added their own modern twist to it. everyone should go.,5
"i can't describe how good the ube coco is, you should try it for yourself.the place has good interior design.",5
nice to see filipino businesses prosper,5
interesting filipino ice cream joint. we tried their sweet potato flavour and that was pretty nice!,4
"love love love the ube milkshake, although is a bit too thick at the end, but the first few sips are excellent.",4
those buns. nuff said.,5
"ube bilog, ube doughnuts, i love ube everything ",5
loved the halo-halo and the black ice cream,4
best ube ice cream in london...,5
delicious. expect a small line. not a lot of sitting room but worth the experience.,5
top,5
the bilogs are ,4
heart ice cream and friendly staff!!,5
the taste of philippines,5
"must try their ube, kind service.please look after your belongings too.limited seating area and long queues are expected. no toilets.",4
"delicious, but be prepared to not find room to sit",4
"it's not easy to find ube ice-cream in london, now i know where to go to get my fix.",4
amazing ,5
lovely exotic desserts and friendly staff. try the queso ice cream!,5
great desserts and good service.,5
very good ice cream,5
original ice cream a bit pricey,3
"great place obvs. in chinatown second branch in kentish town. great filipino icecream in the heart of london across the road from leicester square station. specialising in ube, halo halo, pandesal bilogs and barako coffee.",5
delicious desserts! tastes like home.,5
"the ube hot coco, calamansi lemonade and bilogs top 3 for me, rest of the menu is pretty good as well! oh and the ube donuts on the weekend ",5
great icecream,5
fun and exotic.,3
amazing as ever ',5
nice little ice cream shop,5
the ice cream favour is very special. really like the cream cheese favour,4
the creamy ube flavoured bilog and refreshing halo halo is so delicous. staff members were so friendly and explained all the flavours to me. the shop interior is perfect for taking pictures.,5
ube (taro) and black buco flavour ice cream,4
friendly staff and great ambience,5
had the bilog bun with ube ice cream. freshly made and tasty. beware it can all get filling quickly.,4
best of the best ice cream ever,5
interesting take on the traditional philippine halo-halo. great use of local ingredients that are very similar in flavor and texture as the traditional ones.,4
"a filipino dessert shop where you can have barako coffee, ube ice cream, mamon and the all time favorite  halo-halo! a must try for someone who hasnt tasted ube. the place is a little bit small and people are coming in and out  especially its almost summer time.",5
perfect black ice cream with bread,5
i love the icecream there and the staff are really nice,5
ube ice cream in pandasal. tastes just like in the philippines.,5
amazing - had the best ice-cream sandwich there. ube ice-cream was really tasty and the bun warm and soft.,5
i love the halo halo it's open a new spectrum who knew ube ice was so good over a nice float.  at the bottom of the glass palm coconut seed and young shredded coconut.  it's an amazing experience.,5
i don't know what it's called but i had some donut stuffed with milo ice cream and it was damn good..,5
delicious ice cream ! the flavours are creative and the staff is friendly. definitely recommend !,5
"excellent place for a pit stop and a cool dessert. had the ube flavoured bilog, which is like a hot ice cream sandwich, warm on the outside cold on the in.my only comment is, put some mango flavours options and maybe a plain coconut flavour ",5
this is the difference between light yellow and white guys... ive wasted 3 for nothing....,3
can only give a 3 star currently as didn't stay too long or try enough from the menu. however what i did try (the ube hot chocolate) was delicious and really helped on a cold day,3
"delicious and interesting desserts can get very busy so be patient, it's worth the wait ",5
"amazing ube ice cream! very rich and creamy, with still a nice amount of the ube flavour. would definitely recommend the ""bilog"" which is effectively an ice cream sandwich, using their own take of ""pandesal"" - when served, bread is still nice and warm that perfectly goes with the ube ice cream.",5
all i have had is the bilog (hot ice cream sandwich) and it is amazing. both milo and queso flavors have been excellent. that hot sweet bun with cold ice cream is a fantastic combo.,5
"the flavours they offer are quite unique, and the ube bilog is something i was very pleasantly surprised by.",4
love this place amazing delicious dessert and milkshake,5
super small shop but full of big taste. the decor is fun and cozy and limited seating . i walked in blind not knowing what to order so i asked the staff for recommendations and they definitely led me in the right direction .,5
"ice cream was tasty, shame i couldn't try the black buko and ube flavours as they were out of stock when we went there in the late evening.",5
"beautiful little shop where a lot of filipinos congregate- and no wonder, since the desserts are delicious. definitely try the ube and white chocolate coco if you pass by, its amazing. i havent tried the halo halo yet, but ive heard good things.",5
good service. great vibe. but the milo tastes like chocolate and not milo but the rest is really good.,5
"enjoyed my experience there.  staff was helpful and friendly, service was good and efficient.  i liked the bilgo with ube flavour.  though i did feel it tasted a bit bland.",4
great to try and would definitely come back again!,5
as always amazing food experience...i always recommend it as an authentic food place in london.,5
definitely worth the visit,5
one word: bilog. the black buko ice cream inside the warm toasted milk bun dusted off with a generous amount of icing sugar is my go to.  staff there are all pretty nice and chill and the atmosphere of the place is just cool. can't wait for my next bilog visit,5
toasted pandesal with ube and the ube donuts are amazing!,5
"ube flavour ice cream is real yummmm  not really like the black colour coconut ice cream thou, was too sweet. really cozy place so would rather recommend take away",4
"it's pretty good, but pricey.",4
amazing halo halo and bilog and its a cute little cozy place,5
bit too sweet.,3
ube and coconut flavor. the scoops are sooooo big ,4
"i really like the mamasons in camden so perhaps i had hoped too high for this location, but the service and ambiance were both lacking. the treats are still tasty, but somehow less sweet when served poorly.",3
"enjoyed their yummy doughnuts icecream so much, as well as their brownies and the shake",4
had haircut in last three years here. rly good even i am not living in london and i was always coming to london to do haircut in this store. but sometimes the time to wait is a bit long ,5
best hair cut ever!,5
veronica is super nice and professional! will definitely recommend for waxing ,5
"veronica and her staff were fantastic- very thorough, detail oriented and welcoming!  i was very pleased with my shellac mani/pedi and look forward to a massage next week. highly recommend maple salon! ",5
great mani and pedi bought a voucher on groupon and really enjoyed it!,5
"nice lashes, if not a little too dramatic. i don't think the practitioner understood my request.",3
"would not recommend for waxing. it was particularly painful (small patches of hot wax applied 5/6 times on the same area), and when i came home- i noticed there were quite a few hairs left after brazilian hot wax, as well as after strip leg wax.",3
"i went for a thai oil massage and i was very happy. i will come back for sure. very professional and friendly stuff, also very clean place. i can definitely recommend that place.",5
"great eye lashes, she took great care and attention in making sure they were a high standard. super natural and great quality. i would definitely go back",5
"great central and convenient location to find and very clean and chic inside. i booked a massage through groupon and was well worth the price and quality, felt wonderfully relaxed afterwards! highly recommend",4
"elaine was super nice and great at spotting my pressure points. simple and no frills, but one of the best places for massages in london.",5
"went for a treatment with groupon voucher, and once started was very good and calming.  great conversation too.  good luck there",5
"great salon just few seconds from leicester square. i had a deep lymphatic massage and i felt so good right after. i am going every week for different treatments and it is worth it. staff is amazing, especially 'c'. very professional. highly recommended",5
"good, my barber you moved from elegant to this place. still with the high quality service",5
"amazing prices, big portions, incredible taste. highly recommended!!!5 stars :)",5
"cheap and cheerful japanese diner, big hearty dishes,  cash only!",4
"as someone who is half japanese, i can confirm that this is not japanese food. however, everything else is great! the food is cheap, tastes good, comes in massive proportions, and you'll get it no more than 10 minutes after you order on a busy day. you can eat for 8 and it won't come to 70! a great place to go to with friends.",4
amazing sushi & very good prices.,5
very cheap but nice food. highly recommend,4
great food long que,5
best place for good cheap food,5
very nice japanese restaurant well located in chinatown area with very reasonable price!! highly recommended if you have a crave for japanese food,5
i ordered chicken katsu curry. food is cheap which come in a large portion. food is nice too. the staff there is friendly :) recommend ,5
really good value japanese food in...chinatown. you're definitely not paying for the atmosphere or service but the food is pretty good. had a chicken katsu curry and a drink for less than 10. not bad at all for central london.,4
"the taste of food was great, but the women's toilets were nasty. it is about overall service, not just the food. for that reason i'm changing the review and taking two stars down. please improve the cleanliness of the bathrooms!!!",3
very cheap food which is tasty. i always go for the chicken katsu curry,4
"very tasty, good portions, great price!",5
delicious food and drink,5
just cheap but not great food nor experience,3
excellent food.,5
price worthy.,4
best best best japanese cheap eats in london. cash only,5
"not quite the same anymore compared to 10 years ago... food remained cheap, portions still large, just quality gone backwards a little since... hope they could improve as misato does bring back some great memories...",3
very nice food but not for the stuff,3
"the rice was soggy. the fried chicken wasnt crispy, just exceptionally chewy. they charge service charge, which is crazy considering the level of service. they wouldnt even give me a second spoon, when i ordered soup and rice...the sushi is pretty good, and good value, which warrants 3 stars.",3
"one of my old time favourites! if you are into japanese food, this is a place to visit. small seating area, so be patient..",5
probably the best japanese restaurant in london.,5

"had to give it 5 stars when a violin cover of despacito started playing. gorgeous food at a great price, look at all these reviews!",5
tasty japanese curry - we went for beef curry rice and chicken katsu curry rice. decent portion of main dish as well as side salad with not too much rice. service was fine. waiting time was short enough at 19:30 on a weekday. highly recommended. will definitely return to try the udon.,5
"great place for amazing japanese food, served fast and very reasonably priced in central london. waiting is normal for this place, always packed with dinners but isnt a long wait. leave when you finish, not the place to linger which is most restaurants in china town. bring cash and enjoy!",5
best curry and noodle soups.,5

"had good sushi here. it's a really busy place but the service is very quick, i had my sushi in 10 minutes from ordering at lunchtime. one of the best value for its price for sure.",5
this is just a quick eat restaurant.price is cheap and taste is just as you paying for.they accept only cash and charge you 12.5% service charge as i dont get any good one.its average around this area. i might come back one day.,3
cheap nice japanese food,4
"solid 3 star restaurant.good price, good portion, average tasting food.this place is definitely not a 4 star restaurant, but not a bad place to eat.",3
love this place. ive been going since i was young and the prices and portion size havent changed much. its got a simple menu but its so tasty and affordable so theres always a long queue during peak times.,5
massive portions & so delicious! only reason i didnt rate it 5 stars is because its cash only but a small price to pay (literally)! will definitely come back again.,4

great japanese food in london and the prices are so reasonable. highly recommended.,5

really good food.. decent prices.. cash only...,4
best place in the area. very very cheap and excellent food quality.,5
it's a great place to go to if you wanna stay in your budget. i would give it a 5 but they don't accept card payment.,4

very good food at a good price.,5

cheap and cheerful! portions aren't the biggest but very quick service. can get very busy around 8pm,4

the food is really good and really cheap too! people sometimes line up even outside to get a table (including me and my friends sometimes too :d) but its definitely worth it :),5
"close to the main attractions in london, misato is a very good value for money! perfect for a quick but very good meal!",5
"small but cosy restaurant with good cheap food. at the time of eating there, i loved it, a lot of flavours, however, when i got home, i had really bad diarrhoea probably due to bad food quality. furthermore, they only accept cash so paying was a struggle. i would probably avoid.",2
"yes, there was nicer places than this but they have all gone. somehow they have amazing prices and food today. i been here 10 years and yet i find myself here today.",5
this place saved my life when i was studying abroad in london!! best food with very affordable prices. i tried a variety of dishes and all were very good. definitely coming back here if i ever come back to london.,5
"nice, quick japanese food. not expensive. food come out quick.",4
loved this place written i first moved to london. needs some paint and a little tlc after visiting yesterday. absolutely dirt cheap though!,3
always my cheap and yummy place whenever i can't decided where to go ...... always delicious and very well priced almost always a line ... but never too long worth the wait,5
"i love this place. freshly made tasty food, served promptly.the staff are always respectful and friendly. keep up the great work guys!",5
"restaurant is small. food came out quickly, almost too quickly in my opinion. staff was ok, nothing special. for us ""come and go"" experience. pork was a bit dry, but the curry balanced it out. udon was small, but not bad. not sure if i come here again in the future.",3
"udon soup was a small portion. curry was mediocre. service was okay. the food came out right after we ordered, making it suspicious to whether it was freshly made or not.",3
"best place in london have been eating a few times here while i was in london. the sushi is amazing, we took them as a take-away a few times. today i finally tried a bento. really enjoyed it. it was very full but this is because its so popular. the staff was very friendly.",5
"excellent value and big portions. fast service and courteous staff. tables are quite crammed together, but for a quick meal it's comfy enough for a tasty meal",5
"absolutely value for money. had just the sushi which was satisfing. not the best sushi but for that cost, you get what you pay for. inside is not the greatest but i think for the cost for central london you really cannot complain. i have had the main meals here in the past and the portion will definitely fill you up.",5
great place when you just spent so much money in the city centre that all you can afford...is misato! great food for extremely low price. remember to keep some cash on you tho,5
"nice place to grab something to eat with your friends. food was quite tasty (all excluding the soup - too salty & without original chinese taste). everything was hot,  ingredients were fresh. we haven't waited for long.",4
"what sushi should taste like, one of 2 places that knows how to make sushi in london. rice cooked the right way sushi to die for. cheap too. please don't steal my seat though",5
quick and easy japanese one-dishers. my favorite place since i was a student. the price is very affordable and the food is not bad at all.,4
"this place is a gem. cheap and no frills, but tasty generous portions of fantastic food. honestly don't want it to get too popular, so i can keep it to myself",5
"big portions, cheap prices, good quality food, nice staff. only thing to say is watch out for the long queues. best to go at an irregular time.",5
one of my favourite japanese places in chinatown. well worth the wait and make sure you bring cash. the portions are good value and they have a few vegetarian options too.,5
"love this place. could of been a 5 stars, only down fall is cash only. would love to see card payment, would make it more flexible.  it great food. staff are cool too!",4
japanese cafe just off leicester square. basic decor (cash only) much loved by students. excellent food at amazing prices considering the location so expect to queue but service is fast so it's worth the wait.,5
great food. good portion sized and good price. have to wait for your whole party to get there before getting seated.,5
"good food, good location, excellent price and quick service. excellent local to stop for a short break not taking a take away food.",5
"amazing food, portions were also great, and overall friendly atmosphere",5
"cheap, tasty, fast service, good option in chinatown",5
had to wait for about 10 minutes before we got a table...but had to share the table with random customers...awkward...gave up making conversation with my colleague and just indulged in the food without saying a lot to each other...great food...the chicken katsu noodle soup was my kind of soul food...,4
amazing restaurant! cheap and so good!,5
"giant portions, great price, and delicious food",5
"i'll admit it doesn't good that great from outside but the food is great, good price and staff are friendly.",5
"this has to the one of the cheapest and filling chinese restaurants in china town. the restaurant is cash only. the portions are huge, definitely bigger than you'd expect for the price.",4
one of my favourite restaurants in chinatown. good price and quality. they only take cash!,4
"both my wife's meal and mine were delicious, with lots of flavour, and arrived quickly. and the price was very reasonable. cramped seating, but overall a great experience.",5
never ever disappoints. best japanese food and reasonable price! remember its cash only.,5
"correct prices, waiters are efficient, the food is tasty, but the place is dirty and greasy",3
"amazing food, and the prices are really good for the portion you get.",5
this is one of my favourite restaurants in china town. food is always fresh and delicious. tendon is my favourite dish which i recommend to those who love seafood. the service is fast and the staff was very friendly.,4
"so so cheap, decent portions and tastes good. really cosy little restaurant in london china town. strongly recommend for those hungry on a budget.",5
"very good, the food is very tasty and it's for sure one of the thibgs that i will remember for the rest of mylife for the fact that i ate salad whit chopsticks! lol... the table service it's normal but the food comes pretty quickly. the price is fair for the food!",5
tasty japanese food large portions at a great price for central london.,5
"big tasty portions,  quick service and good value..",5
tasty food but they only accept cash..,4
nice food for the price but it is cash only.,4
one of the best cheap eats in china town. the katsu chicken/pork is one of the best. the udon in a broth with prawns and veg tempura are also recommended,4
it's good but it's hit and miss. one of very few places in london where affordable food can be had. generally good food and very fast service but once or twice i've sat down and seemingly been forgotten about.,4
tendon was so delicious and also so cheap! its real japanese food.,5
"perfect cheap delicious fresh, try chicken katsu curry .",5
"good food, clean establishment, fast service.",4
chicken katsu curry very good value. discretionary 12.5% automatically added to your bill. didn't think much of the chicken soba noodles. fast and efficient service. definitely not the place to have a slow relaxed meal.,4
large portions for an affordable price and very good quality,5
cheap japanese food. great student dinning. chicken katsu curry. your welcome,5
"vey busy restaurant, food is okay, but fair price in city center, will visit again.",3
amazing and large dishes for low prices,5
amazing value for money,4
"down to earth, unpretentious but more importantly, delicious! my favourite lunchtime venue when i visit from out of town.",5
"i would not reccomend this place. portions of rice dishes looked big but the quality of the food was as bad as the service. and my ""soup"" was just water with the most exciting thing for me to eat being the odd accidental spring onion that was stuck to the bowl before filling :d. i added soy suace to give it colour and full flavor.",2
incredible taste!,5
fantastic place had a great meal and service was perfect,5
not sure how it has a high rating. i unfortunately agree with another reviewer that the ratings must be based on large serving size. food is mediocre.,2
"good value for money. youll end up with both your belly and wallet full. its good, do not expect anything fancy thou.",4
"handmade japanese udon, delicious ramen and great menu..excellent value for money! it only accept cash and it's not possible to reserve a seat, but it was never a problem for me, sometimes you just need to wait 15 minutes to seat.",5
excellent value. large portions and delicious food,4
good food and at a good price too!!,5
the best japanese restaurant in soho amazing food and greatest stuff,5
really nice massive plates of food and as cheap as you could get,5
great food for affordable prices and nice staff! we didn't have to wait long for our food at all. it's just that they don't have that space for larger groups so you'd have to wait a while to be seated. we were 6 people and waited around 15min with no line in front of us.,4
"amazing sushi. fresh, tasty, very cheap. simple restaurant, no decorations, no fency bs. great food. highly recommend",5
can't go wrong here. cheap and cheerful japanese food. always a queue here but try and come before or after regular dinner times to avoid queuing!,5
"cheap, fast, large portions and tasty. well worth the money and most of the time, the wait (unless you have to wait over 15 minutes, then ya might as well find someplace else). not many places sell that cheaply arouns chinatown. not recommended if you're going out to eat with more than 4 people.",4
"good costumer service, yummy, good price for nice quantity yay",5
very crowded long ques,3
the restaurant and facilities are really dirty.looked up hygiene rating and discovered they only scored 2.,1
cheap but delicious food!,5
misato is always great value for money. the bento boxes are fresh. the other dishes are very well sized portions. make sure you have cash,5
it's been close to a decade since my last visit here. the katsu curry once again didn't disappoint. huge portions at a great price. enjoy!,5
love this place. great food at great prices. never disappointed,5
ben to boxes very good and reasonably priced.,4
it's very good place for people in a budget. large rice dishes tasty and cheap. keep in mind that it's a bit crowded though,4

"small place, no-good looking floor space but to ignore. cheapest japanese food in whole london, full plates, great tastes and flavors. cash payment only.",5
"great food at a great price, environment is more homely than contemporary and impressive but warm and friendly nonetheless. is cash only.",5
a great place for a quick and cheap bite. the food comes fast and in large portions. highly recommended!,5
"great, cheap japanese food. will need to queue at busy times.",5
the food has remained the same. excellent at great prices. however the customer service has gone downhill slightly. new staff are not as friendly & welcoming as the previous.,3
"great resturant, with really good service, will for sure be re-visiting.",5
cheap and cheerful. can get very busy but worth the wait.,5
"nice staff, very helpful. food is amazing. oishi!",5
"really enjoyed their food! we had to wait for a few minutes to get a seat as it was pretty busy, but clearly this is evidence of how good their food is. we really enjoyed our menu and would go back",4
"we loved this place! the food was awesome and great portion sizes, the prices are reasonable and the service is super fast. highly recommend",5
one of the best value for money places in the area. pretty decent food. recommended.,4
"cheap, really cheap!! the food is not bad......wouldn't say it was the best japanese i have ever eaten but at the price you can't complain.what the place does need is a very, very, very thorough clean. it is grim. you wonder how some places get away with it to be honest. filthy.",3
would definitely recommend this place. excellent food with good prices.,5
one of the best japanese places in london and you can tell as there is always a queue to get in,5
the food always tastes good and is cheap! everybody typically gets the katsu curry which is a great choice but i also reccomend the curry udon and tempura. the sushi is good too but not the best i think.,4
the best budget japanese restaurant in london. and it's cheap too. what more can you expect?,5
i don't know how i didn't know about this place! awesome place for chinese! for what you pay for you get a lot more than you bargain for. the quality of the food is delicious and full of flavour. the staff are always about so you will be served in no time. i highly recommend this place as the food and service are great!,5
expensive for what you get but very nice all the same. green tea ice cream sounds honking but is actually really nice and worth a try.,3
"amazing menu and prices, although lacking in vegetarian options",4
"thus place is popular with japanese, usually a good indication the food is authentic. the prices are great and the servings generous. cash only and there can be a queue out the door to be seated but it's worth the wait. the decor is down to earth. favourite restaurant in london.",5
"great food, bento box delish, fast service, cash only",5
staff friendly with decent quality food reasonably priced. around 7 for large portions of classic (though not convincing) japanese dishes and 3.50 for 500ml can of sapporo. cash only and expect to queue as restaurant is quite small.,4
"cheap, but will not go back. they need to step it up, very run down in every aspect. had a fish, feel something going on in my stomach all night, thats not ok.",1
really nice and cheap japanese cuisine!,5
cheap for a big dish,5
"one of my favorite places to have cheap japanese cuisine ! dont get my wrong, the food is amazing!",5

you can feel it was cheap):,1
"cheap, cheerful and quick - good quality food",4
"very tasty, fresh, healthy and quite cheap food. friendly staff. sometimes it's necessary to queue for a few minutes because this place is very popular.",5
excellent place for couple and family to eat out,5
"consistently the best things about having to travel to london on business (and one of the few things i miss from the city!) amazing food, great prices - just be aware it is cash only and there may be a queue (well worth the wait though!)",5
"i like to eat there, i've been a few times i love the food",5
big servings for a cheaper price,5
"watch out for a ""recommended service charge"" which they try to enforce as mandatory.",3
rude staff. no manners. poor cleanliness and long queuing. no queue management,1
"my favourite japanese restaurant in the whole city. been going here for years and recommended it to countless people. keep in mind, it's one of  london's last places that is strictly cash only",5

"good portions, friendly staff,great  prices",5
"localised japanese food. reasonable price in london, but cash only.",4

the best authentic japanese food i ever had! reasonably priced and big portions.,5

favourite place for a reasonably priced set of japanese food. the place is not pretentious but the food and portion size are great.when in soho it's always top of our list of places to go.,5
"huge, delicious, cheap",5
very affordable and delicious japanese food. large portions that are sure to leave you feeling satisfied!,5
good food and great prices for where it's situated. be prepared to wait if you go in the evening though. oh! it's cash only.. be prepared! :),4
"udon noodle soup very boring. sushi supermarket quality. and service without a smile, or any kind of interaction really. and then they expect you to pay the 12% tip which is already conveniently added to your bill. don't reccommend.",2
"my favourite restaurant for last 6 years. nice food, great, friendly staff. thank you imani for serving us, you have great customer service ",5
fantastic cheap eat in the centre of london. highly recommended. be ready for a bit of a wait if you are going in the evening. amazing katsu curry.,5
"nice little family run japanese restaurant. accept cash only. used to be the cheapest in town, not anymore. still reasonable pricing. staff are friendly but maybe the lady that serve me my drink could have stopped looking at her phone while serving me. otherwise its all good. friendly staff.",3
"good value for money, servings are very large also. we came at 6pm and just beat the queue. i thought the match teriyaki chicken was amazing. will be back for the pure value of the place!",4
very cheap and big portions. flavour is unique.,4
"good food quality, nice staff, quick service, cheap, well located. me and my boyfriend love this place. they make us feel as at home! highly recommended!!!",5
for me the best japanese experience in london. not glamorous but very functional and delicious. for big guys the best portion of food per  in town! amazing prices. can get busy. cash only!! 25 years ive been eating here and it has barely changed. family run i feel the vibe.,4
"big portions, tasty food.",5
exquisite. wonderful service. excellent food.,5
interesting place with good food. felt rushed with no atmosphere,3
very good value.,4
"good quality of sushi. main plates are enough to be full. you need to wait long to find a table on saturday night's. in weekdays, it is ok.",3
"it always has a queue so this time i jumped in too. very tight spaces so if you don't like sharing or sitting right next to other diners avoid. short budget friendly menu. not amazing but it was fine - had the cold soba, tempura platter and chicken katsu.staff were friendly on my visit.",3
"great service, amazing price for food. can get very busy so be prepared to queue, but that's always a sign of a good place. only takes cash",5
the best japanese food i have ever had for such a good price in london.,5
i love the place and their food. the waiters are quick,5
i love this place and the food is so worth it!,5
food is mediocre but i wait for 40 minutes for a udon and my friend already finish her plate.,2
nice chicken. nice and traditional tasting.,4
this is indeed a proper taiwanese fried chicken as i am a taiwanese.,4
found was nice. the seating upstairs isn't very practical though.,3
delicious huge size fried chicken!!!not try anything else yet but will return. also the pearl iced tea was really nice,3
the biggest and tastiest chicken ever! will definitely come back for more!,5
delicious!! try the popcorn chicken or the dragon tea!,5
i am returning to this place since my last visit a few months ago. the standard has been maintained well. the chicken was crispy and juicy and the flavor is just about right not too salty.,4
"waited for 30 mins, and found out they forgot my order!! they had 6 staffs, and 5 of them were chatting and laughing the whole time! nobody noticed i was sitting there and still waiting for my food!",1
very nice shop... food is good...,5
unique menu and great bubble tea!! loved the chips.,5
juicy and tender chicken meat with crispy skin fries to a perfect point that is not hard to chew or soaked with oil. the perfection of fried chicken steak.,5
"friendly staff. chicken was very nice - had the plum chicken fillet. was lovely. chicken still had some bones in it though, not necessarily a fillet (that's the reason for the docked star.",4
chicken is ok but mantuo with condensed milk is scrumptious.,4
"come here for the amazing milk tea, not the chicken. i think good friend chicken a few roads away is much better and tastes like taiwanese fried chicken, but the milk tea is some of the best ive had in london. the selection is small but trust me, they are all delicious. decor is nice and staff are more friendly than other tea places.",3
"delicious fried chicken can be found here, good selection on the menu but don't come here if you plan on having some salad nonsense. the seating upstairs is a little low though making it a bit of an uncomfortable experience.",4
"amazing bubble tea, it's not obvious it sells it but it's just the perfect texture of tapioca and sugar. nice spicy fried chicken, huge taiwan style deep friend chicken chunks which are very satisfying. best new shop in chinatownone of the best bubble tea in chinatown for sure. this or yi fang.",5
good fried chicken. mozarella signature is my personal favorite. the service is really slow and they forget your order occasionally. expect to wait 45 mins for one.,3
"the service is the slowest, dont expect fast fried chicken.... just to get one fried chicken and there was literally only 2 people in front of us. we all waited for more then 20 minutes to get our chicken... the staff couldnt care less just chatting away",1
not very good attitude for their service.the fried chicken was not too bad. and not too good.,2
thick and tasty chicken cutlet! and you may want to have a cup of bubble tea with tapioca which is definitely a taiwanese local street food combination.one can choose to eat upstairs or takeaway.,4
the most delicious chicken i have ever had in my entire life. i can't stop thinking about it. the milk tea? mind blowing.i would die of happiness if they ever open a shop in edinburgh. the king chicken and all the nuggets were outstanding!,5
halal tasty fried chicken in the go in china town ,4
wow! best fried chicken in chinatown and halal! huge portion and amazing taste.,5
popcorn chicken thing is such a good snack!,5
"ayo this place slaps, service was real nice, staff are very friendly and they have good knowledge of the menu. one of the best places to eat in chinatown with street food flavor and amazing place to dine. seats are very unique and the place has character. would go back to london just for this place",5
ling waiting,5
perfect juicy taiwanese fried chicken,5
delicious fried chicken and bubble drink!,5
delicious chicken and bubble tea choices,5
super good food,5
nice new fried chicken shop.,5
best fried chicken in townreal taiwanese style,5
flavourful chicken with good seating,4
"fried chicken, try it and make your own conclusions...",4
just wish the spicy was spicy!!,5
"food is not tooo bad but over priced, really sh#t service from the girl with short purple/ grey hair... rude as hell. not spending my money there again",2
"the chicken is decent, but what you must try when you are here is the buble teas.",4
tasty authentic taiwanese fried chicken!!!,4
"overated, i find the chicken a bit too sweet and lacking in flavour. they claim to be no.1 but i've tried a lot better in taiwan. theres seating and toilets upstairs.",3
authentic chinese style. this is rare in china town.,5
tasty fried chicken. succulent and large portion with nice seated environment.service is a bit slow but feels definitely overpriced.,4
the chicken was cooked very well but the seasoning was far too sweet for my tastebuds. the fried chicken at good friend on little newport street is much more fulfilling and tastier. #friedchicken #tfc #taiwanesefriedchicken #chinatown #taiwanesefood,3
"i ordered broccolis,aubergine and sweet potato fries. all very tasty! but the waiting time is too long, and slightly overpriced.",4
chicken is not as good as good friend so i wouldnt come here for chicken. the drinks here are good though - not too sweet not too bland.,3
"recommend: chicken nuggets and bubble tea! the bubbles are really chewy. nice interior, seats indoor. the only drawback is the fries were soggy.",4
spacious and nice seating area. chicken nuggets  were succulent and juicy.,4
"i got food poisoning after have seaweed combo, chicken wing and  tapioca green milk tea. i need to rest at home for the last three days.",1
nice chicken perfectly deep fried and seasoned. but their fire or black bubble tea are equally awesome.,4
quality chinese food. at a good price,5
the fired chicken is awesome!,5
traditional taiwanese fried chicken in the heart of chinatown. five spice flavoured. fried to order. very juicy pieces. good portion. pretty pricey if ordering 3+ items. bubble tea served here also. seating upstairs.,4
"tasteless, too oily, and somehow undercooked. not similar to what youd find in taiwan unfortunately",1
not good for vegetarians,2
"food was dry, bland and horrible left out for too long and drinks extremely over priced with a disgraceful customer service especially for a place that asked for you to pay upfront. overall do not recommend, rude staff, horrible food and overpriced drinks ",1
worst place in london. very low quality food. rude staff. f thinking to go in because it is good value for money it is not.,1
small but we'll kept nice food clean,5
unbelievable bad they should be shut down.,1
relationship between quality and price is excellent if you like chinesse coucine,5
"bad lukewarm food, we were also seated in a small, dimly lit corner facing a wall. really disappointed that we went there.",1
"great selection of the most popular chinese dishes. eat as much as you can menu, so just grab a plate and go for it. don't expect 'a la carte', but the quality of food is good. very good value too, at just 7.95 per person. ",5
cheapest and best chinese food in chinatown,4
hope you guys never choose the resturant,1
food isn't great! the service is bad and you are practically seated on top of each other. disappointment!,2
"disgusting. don't waste your time or money. flavourless, cold food. i literally had 2 bites. if you want to throw away your money and get food poisoning this is the place to be !",1
"the food is of great quality considering its an all you can eat, the tables are clean and the food is always refreshed. only issue is the waiting staff, they tend to hang around to long and hardly ever smile. but for a taste experience its really good",4
"great value for money and friendly staff, very busy so prepare to wait but worth it",5
not what i was expecting not bad food just staff was not helpful,2
"actually it's really nice place- portions and quality are adequate for the price. the food was very tasty and i really enjoed it, especially, since the restaurant offers a really wide selection of dishes. if you want to eat a lot and cheap it's a great place.",4
not enough space . too cramped difficult walking with a plate full of food . staff seemed unhappy,2
the buffet wasnt the best but was still enjoyable for that price,4
best cheap chinese restaurant in soho london and a nice treat right next door,5
horrible greasy and cold. didn't eat it. just left,1
"horrific. cold food. stale food. dark chilly eating areas full of ugly chairs and sticky surfaces. distant and unengaged staff seemingly set on making you, the customer, feel unwanted and inconvenient. do not eat here...",1
"the staff could be a bit more welcoming and smiling. small place, not a wide variety, but cheap and the chicken was allright",3
don't step a foot in this place you will regret it,1
"great food, excellent prices, but the staff wasnt in its best shape. it didnt feel like we were welcomed in there.",4
not a dressing up type restaurant and no frills but the food is excellent.,5
very good food and proces.,5
"great food and not too expensive, shame they don't serve alcohol",4
"avoid!!!! at all costs don't go here ...  plates cold, food choice poor ... standard low and somehow when i paid the bill they added another 8 for nothing!!!!! best advice ...stay clear ",1
"i wouldnt even waste your energy with this place.. its filthy, food is disgusting, old, bland and watery and their coke is definitely not coke. the staff are also really rude.",1
cheap and cheerful and an awesome location,5
a little tasty buffett with some little choice but nice and cheap,4
dicousting taste of all foods,1
"yes the price was good, but the variety of food wasnt great. very small place. also saw staff eating better quality food than what they were serving the customers. wouldnt go again.",2
"the best in town, a humble place, but all delicious, good treatment, very friendly, the price is very low, i would not mind paying more, it is undoubtedly one of the places where i have eaten better.",5
don't serve tap water and tried to charge us more than the set price when we refused to buy a drink.,1
fast food at a reasonable price,4
good buffet selection left it especially the meat stuff beef.,4
"it says 10.95 outside, but later they charge you 10% extra for the service. what service? i did everything by myself. and the food is not very good. wouldn't recommend.",2
"reasonable price with not bad tasty, good experience all in all",4
"they asked money before we sat down. they are very rude, no welcome. they standing in front of door and make us nervous. foods are ok, price is ok, variety not enough but definitely not worth it.",1
this place has been going for years. excellent quality chinese in the heart of the city. where else in central london can you get a chinese takeaway for 5. nice selection of meat unlike some chinese buffets in town. friendly staff.,4
"my girlfriend left me after i decided to take her here, i want compensation mr.wu",1
great food so cheap mmmmmm,5
good value,4
good food cheap,4
food was great bit cramped got head butted by an umbrella ,5
"excellent, fast, inexpensive and unpretentious...perfect pre-show dinner.",5
not many options really small place,1
"very so-so a mean not many chooses!!!! no prawns or any seafood ,not good !!!",1
"it's more a canteen then a restaurant, but for that price: i don't care... food was good and drinks not overpriced. no service charge here because its self service. london on a budget...",3
worst chinese i've ever been to the staff are rude there isn't a very good selection of food everything is oily. also sit chinese people in shop window to make it look good and stick english people down by the toilets we're they also was the dishes. talking bout toilets wouldn't use them as the smell like a public toilet,1
"very poor, small choice, quite bland, plus why is there a must pay service charge when you are in a self service buffet ???? certainly won't be returning",1
fly's buzzing around the food generally unclean staff seem alright but i would eat here at your own risk,1
"food is good, bit small, and very hot",3
reasonable food for the buffett price with service charge added on when you are serving yourself! dirty toilets with no toilet paper. need cleaning.,3
"8 all you can eat in central london, for this rate, i am not going to complain",5
superb food at a great price.  i love returning every time i'm in london,5
chinese all you can eat restaurant.,4
"good food, tasty, good value for all you can eat, however they dont serve tap water which is a black mark against them. just because they dont legally have to as they dont serve alcohol what if someone faints etc, its unethical not to offer tap water if asked for.",4
if you want the best chinese in london visit karwoo in stepney green or forest gate,1
"this comment will be in italian and in english.ita:prezzo non male, paghi circa 8-9  a persona ma la scelta di piatti  ridotta rispetto ai suoi concorrenti.eng:well price, you pay around 8-9  each person, but the food choice is very reduced.",3
do not try not even for the experience,1
cheap and cheerful!!,3
"avoid, food was cold, tasteless and cold. the only good thing was the spring roll.  11 is better if you go  to macdonalds.",1
"the food was never 5 star really, but it was good for an all you can eat for 7 something.the food now is just bad. the staff are super hostile, not even unfriendly, hostile.",1
"awful service. we did not finish eating, did not leave table and they started whiping it!!!  all food tastes the same.you eat only onion",1
"poor choice, poor quality, poor atmosphere, poor taste, plastic cups ..",2
food ok - i have never been to a restaurant with staff so rude !!!! unbelivable !!! were not allowed clean plates and i had to scrape my own plate.there are other places to go for food just as good !!!,1
"good food, good price! my favourite buffet in the chinatown!",5
"definitely not coming back to this restaurant anymore. the staff were so rude especially that indian/pakistani waiter, horrible service!",1
rude staff and very poor food.,1
best place to eat in chinatown in london. we been visiting from 5 years and never get enough ,5
wasnt impressed with this place.  you get what you pay for.  price is cheap an thats reflected in the service and food.  when the menu tells you they dont serve tap water for free this sets your expectation levels.  food was average and more veg than meat in the dishes.  far better places to eat in chinatown,2
love the choice of food,5
"the employees are so rude, they asked me to go out and i did not even have two hours eating there, i just wanted to get relaxed, so i started comolaining about the service and one of the employees forced me to go out. i do not recommend it at all.",1
"you can as much as you want with 8, but if stay too long,  they will start the air conditioning on full speed to cold even if outside is also cold.",3
great value buffet.,5
"food was okay, the restaurant was clean,staff- courteous.",4
im full,5
"very cheap, no restrictions",4
"delicious food for a very reasonable price, prepaying for self-service is an excellent idea",5
"five stars for quick cheap food. one star for hygiene... top tip, do not go near the loo's.",3
"very cheap the buffet, and beautiful food",5
really enjoyable and cheap too!,5
"one of the cheapest buffets in china town. the restaurant its self its cash only and tables are tiny, you feel a little squashed in. limited selection of food but it tastes good and is replaced fairly regularly. cash only, which seems fairly common in the area",4
great buffet at very reasonable price,4
the food was tasty but limited choice,3
cheap and cheerless. tiny room packed with as many tables as they could fit which means the queue is standing right next to your table the whole time. food quality was average. all of the curry dishes seemed to be a packed with onion....lots and lots of onion....,2
no room in this place not a good selection would not recommend,1
nice place to eat,5
"great food. great price, 8 quid for all you can eat chinese in central london. can't beat it.",5
appalling service. extremely rude staffs. food was cold and tasteless. my friend had noodles which he said tasted stale. never going back again. its simply waste of money!!!,1
not very nice food and poor selection of dishes,1
"decent selection of food, very good value and always packed so the food doesn't stay out that long. been going there 2 - 3 times a month for almost a year now and will keep going back.",5
"staff seemed unwelcoming and unpleasant, forgot our drink order.environment was uncomfortably small and cramped, shoulder to shoulder with strangers, food was limited and low quality, and overall the place looked unappealing to the eye, would not recommend",1
not a huge selection. but for the price and in london it was great value. reasonable quality food too. restaurant was a bit tight. staff were friendly.,4
cheap and tasty,5
"simple, not very spacious, low prices, medium food quality, medium service experience",3
"salty and fatty foods. i only liked the sweet and sour chicken. the staff were not friendly and welcoming. i'd go here if i'm on a tight budget. however, the manager is cute so that's for two stars not the restaurant haha.",2
cheap and good. nothing special but i like it and always return because of the price. thanks.,3
"tasty hot food. had to ask for a spoon/knife (only fork on table).no option of  tap water in this place, very suprised.. 4 stars if water provided.",3
worst place ever the food is so dry and it taste  staled and then warm up i even vomited i will never eat there again,1
the place was small and had limited variety of food,3
very reasonably priced buffet. good selection of dishes.,4
"i think it is a case of value for money. a 10.50 all you can eat buffet that includes duck, pork, beef, shrimp cooked to an acceptable standard as were the vegetables.the restaurant was clean, organized and the  staff friendly. dessert was a waste of time - gelatined milked, tinned peaches and prunes (are you serious mr wu?)",3
"dont be hasty. walk further in and with additional 2 pounds, your tummy will thank you. :)",1
mr wu can suck on my sweet and sour pork balls. hoping i havent got food poisoning. absolutely awful food.,1
"can't beat the value and variety of flavours. worth putting up with the cramped conditions and long wait. going after lunch, food is still fresh and queues much lighter.",5
not good. avoid,1
"poor choice for vegans, food is not great and staff are rude, just want your money and you out.",2
"very poor restaurant, felt very uncomfortable and dodgy- no free tap water and cash only (i wonder why). one star only because the food was decent",1
fast chinese takeout,3
extremely rude woman at the reception. i asked about seafood and started shouting at me unecessary!,1
"food was either bland, mediocre or dry, staff always seemed burdened to help you, too many table with the space, barley room to walk single file",1
"really don't bother. terrible food, rude staff and was asked to pay before we even sat down. very little variety of food choices.",1
crampt over packed but the foods cheap.,3
"bad customer service, rushed to table and asked rather rudely to pay up front. food was also cold, tasteless and seating uncomfortable. find another place",1
we visit mr wu all the time when we are in london great food and wonderful staff.we would like to recommend anyone going for a tasty meal this is the place to go to. we are hoping to to see you again mr wu on your chinese new year so please have a table ready for us.see you all soonyour very old friend mr allen and donnaxxxxx,5
"omg i really regret not searching the review of this restaurant. the food is not bad, but the staffs are really awful. they are so rude. a staff guy gave me a change as if i was a beggar. (he threw it.) they cannot understand my english. (i've never undergone.) if you visit the china town, you must not go there.",1
"only rated 3 as the table space is very small but the food is good, not a huge choice but at 7.95 and all you can eat .... im happy with it",3
"the worst buffet i ever been , lots of choices but all food taste as nothing , not gonna come again ",1
lovely pre theatre dinner. highly recommend. great price,5
"very cheap, but served very bad food and asked for  water in jug,  but refused",1
the food is what you pay for. but to my family this place is a staple london eatery.  it's cheap and edible and in china town and generally just part of the london experience for us. ,3
lovely chiness restaurant. great quality food at reasonable prices. nice service and spacious table layout. ,5
"had to pay first, food was vile. now i know why you pay first. yukkkkk bland tasteless experience.. ",1
all you can eat for 10.95 gbp + 10% service fee. ok but if you don't need to make a pig of yourself you can find much tastier places in the same price range.,2
decent lunch takeaway offer 5,3
i wouldnt eat this food if i was starving to death.,1
cheap budget buffet with decent selection of food. staff are not friendly and make you pay when you arrive which is very odd. food was the usual greasy food you'd expect. ,4
excellent service,5
"pay before eating, surly staff. not the best food in china town.",2
excellent food especially on a budget but eat all you can. only downside is can be very busy and seating is limited. queing system in place ,4
cheapest if not the best all you can eat chinese buffet in chinatown,4
awful service. good effort but poor attainment. i'd rather go to dstrkt and do a bottle than come here and feel like a pauper. ,1
"gross!! don't go! horrible experience. the ""food"" was cold, had no taste, place was crowded, and no water. it's an all you can eat buffet but i didn't go back for more... i left as soon as i could.",1
very good price for a chinese buffet of all you can eat.,3
quick fix cheap and cheerful eat as much as you like buffet. no frills,3
food nice but not much room ,3
"if you don't understand cantonese please don't go into this shop, they curse all their customers in cantonese, especially the middle aged ugly lady, she is really racist if you can understand what comes out from her mouth. only 1 pound cheaper but the service is suck, i don't mind pay more going to others.",1
oh good grief... don't do it... never a good sign when there's vomit in the loo at a restaurant!,1
fantastic lovely happy family restaurant. eat big for a fraction of the big restaurant's.  see you again on our next visit,5
"nope nope nope. uncomfortable, small, cramped space with bland food that all tastes the same. even for a quick bite, you should look elsewhere.",1
"absolutely horrible food, would not recommend at all. they need shutting down for the food they serve, everything was either cold and rock hard or just warm and soggy, everything was soaked in grease.",1
"busy buffet on weekends, food is replaced often. cheap at 8.95 and soft drinks at 1.50. however, not much choice (more vegetables than meat, cheap greasy cuts, food did not taste great very average). to sum it up, go there if you are starving but do not expect much).",2
"from the door in, the restaurant looks dirty. the seating is awful. the food is 1 star at best. the drinks were all watered down. the staff was not friendly at all. i would not recommend this place to anyone. chinese food in usa's crappiest safeway is better. ",1
"simple chinese food. very good value for money. actually the quality of the food and the service is dropping down in time. it was the best cheap food in the neighborhood, now is still the cheapest but the worst food.",2
terrible service the worst i have ever seen in 30 years was shouted at by a member of staff,1
firstly if you're going here you might as well go to mrw buffet up the road as it's pretty much the same place but with better food. this place is usually packed as it's cheap. the service is the usual china town style. you feel like you're going through border control instead of eating out. can be fun though.,3
decent chinese food. not a huge variety. good place to get a legitimate all you can eat chinese in chinatown. very central chinatown location.,3
the cheapest and best tasting food in chinatown!,5
"the food was quite dry. the rice was overcooked and there was no extra sauce. the shrimp crisps and spring rolls were good tho. but you only get a fork, no knife or chopsticks and the drink aren't cold.",2
i asked for extra chicken not eczema chicken. food was clearly more than a day old.  and for some reason they don't 'sell water'. which was good because there were no mens toilet anyway.,1
"eat at your peril, food hygiene terrible.shame can't give it zero stars.got stomach  cramps and was ill a few hours after eating here.poorly for days after.i should have read the reviews first about it being bad.going to report it to environmental health this week",1
really cheap all you can eat and tasty authentic food,5
"if you just want to eat rice and noodles, then it is okay. but everything else was poor. stale food. 10% service charge?! what service???  a person ran into the toilet and threw up in the sink when we were there.... wasn't a pleasant experience.",1
disgusting buffet! everything was sooooooooo dry and defo not worth 8. it was sooo bad that i only ate half a plate. i recommend to you guys to not come this place.,1
one of the waitress were rude ! she was kind of mad while talking to her ! after that ! the food was ok.,1
terible service cold food rude staff avoid this place,1
waiter services was bad. they served buffet but looking down on people as feel like only poor ppl will eat there.,1
it is definitely 7.95 quality food,5
no taste,2
"awful restaurant, think ive got food poisoning now",1
very bad experience... rude and unhealthy,1
"ate there & the atmosphere is so tense with staff & they want payment there & then & they charge for left over food too!?!? they are so rude! food quality low, hygiene low & all tables squished together i will never return or recommended the place!",1
"cheap all you can eat, went there during chinese new year, so it was really busy. the food was nice with a big selection, there are many healthy options. the flow was a little bit strange, but they'll help you if you ask.",4
place was filthy and the food was plain,1
rude staff. no tap water available but told this quite abruptly with the tag line 'we don't serve alcohol so we don't have to serve tap water'. nice food. horrible staff and service.,1
"food was cold, salty. i bought a drink and asked if i could have some tap water and they just shoved a menu in my face saying the government doesn't require them to supply tap water. so, for 8.95 this isn't worth it, all you can eat fine, but the food is so sub par you won't want to.",1
disgusting food .poor costumer service. very unhygienic. will advice u not to go that shop .i would give it 0 stars ,1
"rude staff, rip off prices on sundays and poor food, all whilst crammed into a tiny shop with barely any room. please find somewhere else to enjoy your sunday!",2
can't beat mr wu for a cheap eat there's a pretty good section of dishes on offer and it's eat as much as you like.,5
food quality is on or above average and the environment is fine. the only issue is that the staffs seems to be hurried and they're always staring at the front door. and it feels like someone is staring at you when you're having your meal.,3
"extremely crowded and the whole experience was ordinary. it's really cheap especially for central london, but don't visit the place if you want to enjoy a calm dining experience. the food quality is all right, but there were several things that were way too salty.",3
"mediocre, staff not very friendly",3
please don't waste your money- horrible foodthe chips were stale it tasted like it was there an entire week. none of the food was fresh or great tasting. there isn't even an option of free tap water. i have yet to find an actual good chinese restaurant in china town.,1
"7 all you can eat, very decent quality food and a good selection as well. one of the best cheap places in central london to grab a bite",5
the food was terrible and cold. the food looked like something out of men in black. the staff were rudeness and disrespectful. they don't do tap water???  toilets are grim,1
"small interior and few selections, but food is decent. ",3
"food is very average, but to be fair it's a good value for money chinese buffet. you eat your fill, leave and forget you were ever there. it's a mcdonalds style food stop, if mcdonalds did chinese.",3
very good price for a buffet. it's a tiny place with very few places to sit,4
we loved the food. it's small and you must pay  before you eat. but we enjoyed it. we will be back this winter.,5
very friendly restaurant good food and service,5
"i can see why mr wu has many 1 star ratings.buffet food is greasy,salty and warm.mens toilets is dark smelly and filthy.i dont like giving bad reviews,but what i have written is an honest review.",1
"if you are looking for cheap and cheerful, at least it's cheap!",3
really bad food and rude staff and management fried rice smelled rotten we did not eat it. please pay a little more go somewhere else. they also make you pay before you eat because they know how bad the food is.,1
not to bad.... 8.99 dinner plus drink its ok,5
the buffet had a good selection of fresh cooked items and all piping hot the selections are a good balance of authentic chinese & western variants,5
7.80 for all you can eat. good food. probably the cheapest restaurant in soho.,5
great chinese food buffet at very affordable price - eat all you can!the restaurant does not accept credit cards.  cash basis only. #lvpmoment,5
the food here is soooooo bland.  just no taste and staff never smile.  it is very cheap though so a star for that,2
buffet but limited choices. affordable.,4
good food for an incredible cheap price,5
we only had a fork to use and a plate the man told us to sit down and pay first he was very rude and was talking in his language the whole time. toilets were filthy and didnt flush. and any wasted food you have to pay extra for. stay away from this place.,1
"asked for money as soon as we sat down with no welcoming, watched everyone eat, small selection of food with most being dry. wouldnt recommend.",2
very poor food qualityfor a chinese restaurant so close to china town this is a very bad example of chinese cuisine i definitely wont be returning,1
nice little chinese restaurant. good prices.,4
worth every penny,5
vastly overpriced for the standard of the meal and service not great,2
great place.  food good and plenty of it .good value  xx,5
the food was cold. wasnt nice at all. no flavour. the people who worked there were rude. if i could give it no stars i would. it needs to be closed down.,1
very nice food for the price they serve it for. the service was really enjoyable.,5
"in the food lottery of life, this.tips the balance into happy land.never left unhappy or hungry and never regretted later, any restaurant that can do that for you, is something to be treasured.",5
"little choice, food is no taste, the menu is bad at all. 7.5 for the person is too expensive at the menu they have.",1
"it does the job, i can't complain, good value for money.",3
"just left this place. absolutely trash!!  staff were so rude, spoke loudly in their language drowning out any chance of having a decent conversation. food was warm and not nice. will definitely advise you to spend the extra and go around the corner and have a better experience.",1
good value - but cash only,5
"excellent food at a very reasonable price, can't go wrong for a quick cheap meal in the centre of london",5
really would not recommend.  the food is pretty poor quality - most of the starters and not edible! go somewhere else!,2
"quick service help yourself buffet. not many options, but a good selection at a very reasonable price.",4
very small but lovely food topped up regularly,4
"decent food , good service ",5
"cheapest buffet restaurant in china town, the food is ok but quite dried out, not a huge selection and the staff generally don't have a great attitude, refused to move tables for us and insisted our party sat seperated. the toilets aren't very nice, pretty ccramped and not clean. ok for a budget but otherwise go somewhere else",2
very enjoyable,4
 its hot and dirty on the inside and the food is barely edible. i should have known better than to come here. will not be returning. ,1
"the food doesnt look really like chinese style; the food looks like been hours, not worth it to try",1
my favourite chinese . 5 star,5
horrible food and horrible staff. we founded lot of hairs in the food. staff is rude and agresive. place is dirty. don't waste your money,1
bad food and none existent service.,1
quick and convenient eat as much as you like chinese restaurant great for people in a hurry to make the theatre curtain up,2
"cheapest buffet style restaurant in china town. 8 per person.very simple, no fancy. food is ok, not a great choice. recommended for hungry people rather than picky.",3
"probably the cheapest restaurant in chinatown, no whistles and bells but great food for the price.",4
it was an awful experience. there was a staff member (a woman) who was so rude and extremely lazy. she would bark at both the stuff and customers. she would watch customers eat and the food was sub par.,1
food was okay very cheap worked out at 56 pound for 4 adults and 2 kids,3
"food was luke warm at best. staff were very rude and dismissive. quite frankly, the buffet from hell. skip this one ",1
this is an awesome place to buy chinese food in china town...what no better place to eat whilst standing under chinese lanterns listening too the local busker! and for only 5 takeaway or 7-95 eat in .....brilliant,5
"the food was okay, for the price (7,95) you can't get anything better but the service was abusive. they where checking and asking if we were finished every 3 minutes, i could feel the waitress in my back looking while we were eating. i felt very uncomfortable.",2
"cost us 24 2 adults, 1 child, all you can eat, can't go wrong in centre of london for that, sat downstairs though, not quite sure about fire safety regs, you'd be pretty trapped down there if something were to happen upstairs, food hygiene seemed good and was tasty xx",3
this used to be one of my favourite buffets around but the quality of the food has taken a steep dive downhill.they also put the prices up to make up for the horrible food. also it's always busy in there and every table has little to no elbow room.,1
"great buffet food with a wide selection.only downsides were they oddly do not take card payments which is baffling for london. also, water was 3 a glass, so i'd sneak in some of your own soft drinks.food was hot and fresh, there was plenty of seating.",5
"used to be popular due to reasonable prices. now is full of dubious clientelle. do they know how to spell ""hygiene""?",3
"cheap, 8 pounds per person to eat, food is just acceptable but for all you can eat in london is ok",5
an okay spot if you are in a hurry and don't mind buffet food. we popped in on our way to visiting the picturehouse cinema in picaddilly.so we were pressed for time.as is their want credit cards are not accepted do make sure that you have cash. relatively cheap so i will not complain.not likely to visit again.,3
"good food, but the staff members might rush you.",3
you can eat well amd fast for a small amount of money,5
"for a takeway, it's great. we paid 10 pounds for two persons and had great food. hot, nice chinese buffet. rate it five for it cheapness. well done mr wu!",5
food could of been warmer. more vegi options please,4
"we seek this place out everyone we're in china town. i'm sure it's the lowest priced buffet option in the area. totally not fancy at all and it's a bit cosy seating wise, but the kids love it and it's not killed us yet, so that's something",5
food is great but the staff not polite at all.,3
"small buffet in chinatown, all you can eat for 6",4
all you can eat at 10 . very good food. but be carefull what you put in your plate you will have to pay for what you don't eat.,5
excellent authentic chinese food!and you'll never be disappointed.,5
fast service - friendly staff - flavours are okay,3
very good dinner. we had enjoy all we had ordered. the staff is kind and helpful. the price is good. i would go there again.,5
"no wait ? seriously ? been here for 1 hour and kept saying 10 min, they offer more discount for the 2 hours wait. what a bad offer , which i could give less star if i could give. very bad experience",1
"my friend and i tried the hotpot buffet here. the service and the food are amazing. the waiters are friendly and kept reminding us when their kitchen was going to close, and they were very efficient. the meat and seafood were fresh and good. highly recommended.",5
had fantastic meal at reasonable  price,5
"got recommendation from my colleague and came here today. the staff are really warm-hearted and welcoming. i really love the fish here, as well as beef cushions. with the cute price, ill definitely recommend my friends to come.",5
"very expensive,  cheaply produced, overly sweet food. the filet steak dish had the consistency of dog food, the noodles dry and tasteless. this place definitely takes advantage of its location.  much better places to eat in the area.",1
authentic chinese food restaurant in chinatown. the food tantalized my taste buds. absolutely the best chinese cuisine i had in london!,5
great authentic sichuan food and hotpot,4
"good food and quick service, despite having so many other customers to serve.- toilets could do with some work but its a small price to pay in exchange for the food here.",4
sadly the chinese crispy belly of pork was very over cooked. i have eaten here many times and this was the first time it's not been good.,3
"dirty, slow and standard foodthe place was the most dirty i've seen ever. we waited 1 and a half for two person menu. the food was ok but when we got all plates we weren't hangry. not to repeat never.",1
good place & good food.wc needs to be more clean,4
amazing hot pot and loads varieties,5
"we went for a sunday lunch as a family of four (kids 5 and 9). the ground floor was cozy and quiet. staff was friendly and helpful. we had a peking duck and dumplings. both were delicious. prices were reasonable. most importantly, the toilet was clean!, assuring sign for the restaurant's cleanliness.",4
cheaterno student discount. rubbish taste. pocker face on the staff,1
"mixed experience. staff were all great and service was fast. free wi fi. however, price was a bit steep and too much msg in the the stock. other ingredients tasted nice though.",3
"i've been twice here for dinner and sat downstairs. once for hot pot (first hot pot ever!). food was very good and staff friendly but price could be a bit lower i think. it's not so well organised but both times i got table and food not waiting much. it's an informal family restaurant, worth a visit.",5
"went for the hotpot deal and it was great! quick service, friendly staff and a good range of food for unlimited hotpot",5
really authentic chinese. like in china. not the typical european chinese restaurant. hot pot is a big yes too. not too expensive for the quality.,5
lovely chinese restaurant in the heart of london,4
"food was nice with good price, the service was excellent, they gave you good suggestions if you don't know what to order, and provide free dessert before main dishes and free fruit after you finish. i'll try it again with my friends.",5
a great chinese restaurant in the heart of london chinatown.  highly recommended.  i got the duck dish and it's the best i've every tasted.,5

the table n chairs r very dirty,1
nice chinese food with good price.,4
five of us went for a birthday meal on a recommendation from a friend. we didnt know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and service. the decor is trendy and the price is very reasonable. i would recommend this to anyone and will visit again.,5
"it was ok but nothing special and a hefty bill. however, there were quite a few orientals dining here which i suppose is a good sign. average place.",3
"very convenient location, very authentic chinese food and great service! steamed scallop, steamed eel with black bean sauce, noodles in spicy soup are highly recommended!  vegetable dumpling is a very good choice if you are a vegetarian.",5
"it seems not big restaurant, but it has a lot of space downstairs. staff are friendly helpful when needed. the food was tasty and pretty quick. the prices were fair.",5
"nice food, friendly staff, quick service",5
that was upsetting to say the least. i could forgive the half awkward half rude service if the food wasn't the most offensive plate of gloop i've ever encountered.who in their right minds serves a plate of hot cucumber?,1
this place is just amazing!! the food is amazing along with the staff!! i cant wait to come back! its simply amazing!the best chinese food ever! best serving!! love the rice! people come here!!5 star tea!! i love it!!,5
 really good restaurant. the staff gave very good service and the food was excellent. definitely will come here again.,5
"what food we did have was nice. unfortunately we were given a starter,  waited half an hour, as people around us were served multiple courses, and then gave up on ever getting food. a fine example of why service charge should be at the customer's discretion.",2
"this is proper british-cantonese cuisine. service seemed really slow until we realised there are call buttons on the wall for those seated downstairs, then service was really speedy esp. given that the restaurant was full. wine list is a bit 1980s but good value for money, food runs to being spicy rather than bland.",4
"they have wifi here but it loads rly slowly. always come here for hotpot, their fish is so good, couldnt find anywhere nicer.",4
"the best chinese restaurant ive ever eaten at. i asked for a recommendation which was fish & it didnt fail to deliver.great atmosphere, stunning food 100% recommend.",5
the food was good and the staff really nicewe had 5 dishes and it was quite cheap and good,4
"the chinese food is the best in this area, very traditional! have tried the hotpot here is delicious, the ingredients are fresh and come with big portions. must give it a try if you are looking for some high quality chinese food.",5
"great place, and very nice food!",5
always down for a spicy hotpot but having a dry hotpot with no soup is a first! interesting experience and i especially liked the big fish balls with great stuffings there.,3
the young chow fried rice and the bbq selection was good compared with other restaurants nearby.,4
"i go there for 3 things. the kungpo chicken, the fried green beans with pork and the cumin lamb. the service and decor are average but the food is fantastic. quite pricey but food above average.",4

"new china restaurant is our favorite chinese restaurant in london. some of our favorite dishes include the spicy garlic prawns and the chicken corn soup. the restaurant has an upstairs and downstairs, so if you walk by and see that the main floor is full, don't lose your hopes of getting a table.",5

great service. food to follow,5
good food and friendly staff,4
listen to the staff! they have very good recommendations and will give you an amazing experience there. went away not only well fed but also with new tastes!,5
some dishes were quite tasty. other dishes had enormous amounts of salt. seemed popular with local chinese people. may give it another try.,3
service was attentive but some of the food was average. felt it was too greasy and the sweet chilli sauce was vinegar and mot at all sweet.,3
very good chinese foods!!! thank you for the service.,5
"great food, very stroppy waitress won't be returning",3
"possibly the best green bean and mince pork i have ever had. strange three-floor place, but it didn't matter that they made us sit in a corner and share a table with strangers, the food was good and worth it.staff and food a little slow, especially since it didn't seem that busy, but still worth it for the tasty dishes.",5
we went last minute for the new year when our preferred option had a huge queue. food was good and they had all my favorite veg options just like in hk.,4
"accidentally came here after confusing it for a different restaurant and i'm so glad i did! great atmosphere, friendly staff, and the best chinese food i've ever had! i will definitely be coming back!",5

early friday 14th june 2019 there was an ugly middle age chinese lady work as a cashier there she was shouting at me and my friend while we were paying money. the english language she used with us was very rude plus her action. i would spread this bad service whithin my whole community. bad servive.,1

best live rock covers ever !!,5
brilliant night . the band were good and the service at the bar was fast,5

good selection of beers. food is average quality but cheap enough. staff are rather slow.,3
lovely irish pub in the heart of the city.,5
had a blast in here the other night. live music was on point and the whisky prices were very reasonable.,4
it's good for a west end pub and the price is ok.but you can get fed up with the irish part of it.thay are all the same.,4
"fun night, lively and lots of choice for what to do (pub, dancing, bands). always a good option in the day as well, as it's big, and an intestering building to look round. due to its size and how busy it can be it can feel a bit sticky in places.",4
"prices were very expensive for the experience you are getting - a normal pub with nothing special about it. toilets were run down, inside was dated and music was so loud you had to shout to be heard. i went here after 8pm on a saturday and they had a dj come in around 10 who seemed decent.",2
if you like plastic pint glasses and large tv screens it's fine.,3
"good pub, super central, good selection of drinks and they show sports with plenty of big screens around. also they have some really good live music too which is great and the space is rather big with 2 floors. staff are nice and the food isn't too bad either. good place to meet friends.",4

good pub but the doorman a bit cheeky. you could meet a lot of man and woman here at the weekend.,4
great place for a night out. need more bar staff though on a friday. dj played good songs bit couldn't mix so they need a better dj. band upstairs were really good.. would go again,4

"went there to watch rugby game.. it looked complicated for the staff to tell us whether they were showing it or not ',.",3
very lively nice atmosphere,4
best place in the vicinity for live music. top floor absolutely rocks. drink choices very limited but it's best seen as a music and pints venue. friendly staff. bouncers quite righly make sure people aren't too drunk before entering so best to get there and enjoy your night inside the venue if you intend to have a large one.,5
opens till late.,3
"it is ok! the security guards are always very rude to anyone, it feels like they are doing you a favour in let you in. there better pubs around, like all bar one just around the corner",2

very nice pub in chinatown with live music in the top floor,5
delicious food!!! is perfect,5
good sporting pub/bar. reasonable pint prices and the food looked good! however... a lack of stools / drinks ledges made watching the football game uncomfortable (having to stand and hold your drink).,4
great fun place to have a beer or two,5
music was very good. pop for who loves pop in the 2nd floor and rock for who loves rock on the 3rd floor. go grab some points.,5
we bought the comedy and meal. i had the pizza and my partner had the burger.. pizza was really really good and the burger my partner said the burger was tasty.the comedy itself was great and the prices of the drinks weren't bad at all.thank you so much and i will return if i'm in london again!!,4
"somehow i always have crazy nights in here. if you like pubs with live music, where you can be yourself - that's your place! although, get ready to stand the whole night as it's not crowded with seats or bar stools.",5
good service and good food,4
superb meal in a lovely atmosphere,5
great place and live music,5
awesome place to chill out,5
the live band was awesome and the drinks were on point. if you want to grab a drink and sing along this is the place for you. upstairs had the band and a bar while downstairs was just a bar where you could still hear the music and was a little more low key.,5
always a decent spot to watch a football game,5
stunning pub! came back to london for a few days and was impossible not to come around to visit the best pub in the city. a real experience and a must be as is so close to picadilly circus.,5
"favourite place for a night out. the music, the vibe and pretty much everything is so good. drinks are with decent price and the service is really cool as well. 100% would recommend it.",5
love a saturday night here. a nice mix of people. live music or dj. plus no matter how busy it is there is always lots of staff on hand so i rarely have to wait long to be served.,5
horrible waiters. bad service. our food was not cooked enough. we ordered cod&chips and the fish was almost raw. the waiter throw napkins on our table. that kind of thing should not happen! i seriously don't recommend this place.,1
"great atmosphere, staff very friendly and helpful, food is good and quick service :)",5
a great pub where you can enjoy your time with friends and listen to good music. sometimes they have live music too,5
"i really enjoy this pub, good atmosphere and a nice break from the chaos of the city.",5
absolutely loved it. great place to see matches.,5
great for under 30s bring your i.d!  black brothers will have trouble getting in but trust me it's not really your cup of tea music wise.,3
"very nice live music band concert, lovely time.",5
banging place. live music and easy serve bar,5
great place to see and listen some really good music. nice beer and a smoking area on the roof.,5
massive and 5 floors of bars splendid,5
"great pub, amazing music",5
"place is great, nice live music and all, but i don't understand why some nights you need to pay for entrance, and some not. had a lot of fun with my lads last week, reviewing just now because i lost my old google account, but definitely worth going to!",4
"this place will always be our place, thank you so much for having us for 15 years and for being a host of my party recently. it's been a great fun as always!!!cheers ",5
"good atmosphere, followed by a cheeky pint!",4
"nice food, beers and friendly staff",5
great bar section. drinks was good.,5
staff were very friendly and helpful i had a burger with chips which i really enjoyed.i was there about 5 oclock and it was quiet but speaking to the bar staff was informed it gets a lot busier later on,4
been here a few times now. good place for a couple of pre-drinks. haven't stayed there till night but it seems a really good place.,4
"if you're coming to watch live sport,  don't bother. staff couldn't care less, refused to put the game on at first so we missed the first goal and the 'big screen' is made up of 6 smaller screens, so feels like you're watching the game through your neighbour's window.",1
great family friendly bar.,5
"great pub, music a bit too loud though.",4
"nice atmosphere, good live music",4
"brilliant venue, the best place to see some big names.",5
"jazz festival,live music, budapest ragtime band...",5
most friendly staff.. and entertainment was off the hook as it catered for all. this bar truly is london thee no 1 bar,4
decent spot in london. great selection of drink on offer and it's a good place to enjoy live music. bit much calling it an irish pub as it's not overly authentic. still good though!,4
my favourite pub,5
staff chatting. they have no knowledge of products available. very basic english,2
great irish pub,4
"if you're so drunk that this is your only option, go home!",1

"a nice, open, pub, with good conveniences ",4
"it's an o'neill's it does what you'd expect decent enough pub, expensive beer, but that's to be expected.",3

"great staff, amazing music",5
good service. good vibe,5
"good music, nice place to go with friends",5
great live music every day!free entry allora every day!,5
great boozer right in the heart of soho,5
"was in on a saturday afternoon during the six nations. the england/italy game was being shown on many visible but unobtrusive screens. the  commentary was only turned on after management were reminded the game had started, but i think this was just because they were very busy focusing on customers.",4
"nice pub, comedy club too. visited 8th june. fantastic comedians. highly recommended for a great night",5
"largely a fun evening, however unfriendly and overzealous door staff and a couple of sub par guinness make it a bit troublesome to score higher than 3/5. worth it for an organised night, would avoid impromptu visits.",3
"if you want to have fun, go there. 1st floor a big bar, 2nd floor a fence floor where you can dance, 3rd floor very good live music!! a little bit expensive if you go late in the night (10)",4
this is a nice pub with good music and great wings what a plate of wings. but it is the most un-irish irish bar. not one person working there was irish well on the night i was there there wasn't. for this reason i took stars away.,3
expensive peroni but nice to sit upstairs at the front and watch the world go by.,5
always seems like a good idea,3
good ambience.great live music.,4
not a bad little pub for a few beers worth the visit,3
"always great place full of tourists and young guys from university, great live music, don't get to much drunk, cheers!",5
difficult to get past security without id after a certain hour but decent fun.,3
we were able to catch the nfl game and listen to a great cover band. people from black tie weddings to t-shirts were showing up. great melting pot for a late night pint,5
very nice place. live music and amazing ambient,5
good size portions of food at reasonable prices. some interesting non-alcoholic drinks as well. one point off due to some drinks on the menu we wanted to order not being available.,4
was a nice lil pub. we were out of townes just looking for some food.,4
"good venue for music, drinks and meet people... just get early!",5
we were there last year and had a great time. great cover band.. and i look forward to visiting again when i'm in london next week... .are thursday nights still a good night to go?,5
nice drinks and good dj on saturday night,5
quite touristic. but what do you expect in this part of town? good place to have some fun altogether :),4
really good place and will come back always.,5
loved the atmosphere. drink prices aren't normal and service is good,5
"very fun place, staff always helpful, live rock music on the last place and very friendly clients! the security is also doing a good job!",5
"after a fab night out, i lost my phone at o'neill's - so grateful to the person who handed it in and them keeping it safe for me, especially the manager (think it was elena) 5 stars all round for o'neill's!",5
a good place in london to share with friends!,5
great place to have a fun in london. great coctails and live music! open till late houres. have fun! )),5

"had a great time on top floor. less staff, took ages to get drinks.",4
"a fun, relaxed irish bar with cracking live music.",4
perfect pub. rock music and beatiful atmosphere. join it. absolutely amazing!,5
found the music too loud but i'm sure it's good of you want that kind of atmosphere. also pretty expensive.,3
can't go wrong on a saturday night. entry is pricey but the venue is huge with friendly staff,5
amazing and all the people working there was very nice,5
absolutely loved this place and the live music were the best.,5
"nice pub,friendly staff.price of pint was 5.15 which i taught was reasonable for location. good for watching sport lots of screen,booths where you can sit had on personal screen to watch also which was pretty cool.in the heart of chinatown also so perfect for drink after seeing china town itself",3
a great night out as always in london. and the staff are nothing but helpful if you forget to collect your belongings at the end of the night when you return to get them,5
"really great service, especially  shennae who gave myself and my friends an excellent service. would highly recommend.",5
"well, nice enough food selection, good price. could do with more desserts though, but that's not really the main focus i suppose.",4
"aw man such an amazing place to come with your friends, amazing beers, drinks, food and amazing staff. could not recommend enough. :)",5
"awesome place! i had a lot of fun, the vibe was great, especially with the band that we saw (that guy can sing everything!!). you can tell everyone was having a good time there. worth to explore if you're around.",5
classy oneils but gets very busy any time of the day,4
"it was nice, but too full couldn't seat down",3

super cool bar with an amazing live band! great atmosphere!,5
o'neills is always a smashing time! been a few times for friday night live music which is awesome.,5
super fun two floor bar with a dance area. decent prices for central london.,5
"oneils goes hard. definitely a booming culture and a good time. the music is a little old and behind a few years, but still worth jamming to.",5
amazing band and really nice atmosphere ,4
the staff is friendly and there is a great atmosphere but it's supposed to be an irish pub and they don't sell any stout ! some people don't even know what kind of beer it is..,2
brilliant night for a monday. dj played awesome tunes all night,5
"i obviously love the food here, it's totally amazing with the food and drinks, the music rocks",5
"the ipa is ok. standard o'neills offering, food ok.",3

fancy pub with 3 different floor so all type of different music good for everyone,4
"great atmosphere, live bands were excellent.  prices a lil steep but it is london for you",4
good place to meet up with friends. must go back to see a band,4
over crowding the place just want to get in as many people as possible.also staff are rude had to wait to get in the smoking room as the bar boy and security started a conversion for about 3min they did not want to know or any one to disturb there chating.,2
"good selection of beers and spirits, friendly staff and live music in the evening.",5
"good drink options, friendly staff and overall good atmosphere.",4

"i enjoyed my experience. was in town on holiday and wanted to watch some rugby. found this spot. glad i did, enough tvs wasnt to crowded. service was very good. a bunch of beers on taps. wings are different from the usa, not terrible. if in town i would say stop in. not to pricey either.",4
i think there was something wrong with the taps did not really like the extra cold guinness,2
"excellent chinese food. the lse fried rice is delicious. old town 97 is a good place for a fast, delicious and cheap meal in london.",5
always got food here after a night out and the service has always been fast. staff aren't as friendly but their job is on point.,4
good for a drunken night out,3
great food. very busy though.,5
waiter was very rude.i wont  recommend this place.food was okay.,1
"as a singaporean, and a regular patron of oldtown97, this place gets my stamp of approval. it's one of the few asian restaurants in london that actually does fried rice any justice! if you're there, try ordering the ah meng fried rice dish - it's an off-menu item that hits all the right spots. (you're welcome!)",5
this place was open at 3am for some reason. the food was pretty good.,5
"nice spot for a quick and easy chinese meal. good value for money, at least for london. the duck was good!",4
"the best chinese food ever, worst customer service ever as well, waitress all rude and angry.",5
"the food was trashy, unsubtle and overpriced. the waiters were un-attentive and the minimum 9 spend was a frustrating gimmick that was forced rudely upon us. there are far better value, tastier chinese restaurants in chinatown. keep looking.",1
"i had there mongolian dice stake thingy... was sooooooo good. i was hungry and i forgot to take a before picture.. but here is an after, totally worth it. first time there, certainly won't be the last.",5
"good food and environment, recommend to get a table at 1st floor!",4
"quick service,average food, rude staff",3
super food with a loyal young asian clientele. a great discovery.,5
very interesting place to go extremely late at night to cap off the festivities. i was staggered by the amount of staff operating the restaurant at 4am,3
food is tasty and there was a very wide selection to choose from although the service was subpar and could be improved,3
"customer service here is the worst, we were given the wrong food and shouted at my the women who said we had to tip and that next time we should do takeaway if we don't want to tip. the food is not bad, but i personally won't be going back to eat here.",3
"extremely rude waiter. requested for apologies, waited almost 20minutes before someone else took slight interest in approaching the situation. the owner apologised later on but it hardly changed the fact that all our appetites were lost. waiter in guilt didnt attempt to apologise. terrible service, extremely disappointed. avoid!",1
have frequented this restaurant regularly as it's open late nights and you're guaranteed good food and super fast service. prices are also very reasonable.,5
"good firm favourite of mine for a hearty chinese meal. quick and reasonably priced, the service is good. always busy which is a good sign ",4
banging,5
"great service, even better food and all at 4 in the morning!",5
"very authentic hong kong/cantonese food, the lse fried rice was okay. the service isn't the best and staff can be a bit rude. it can be a tad pricey but sometimes you get a discount if you pay in cash.",4
",",4
really not great! its relatively more expensive than other options in chinatown! dont go :(,1
they are so racist... i had a beer and the security told me i'm drunk.,1
my favourite chinese restaurant in china town and open late hours too!,5
"great selection of food, but the curry noddles is the best!",5
great food. great service. definately try the salt and pepper crab!,5
one of two remaining hong kong style local restaurants in london,4
the waiters here are extremely rude and uninterested. the portion is decent for the price but the quality and the food overall is terrible considering they charge an exorbitant amount. the unfriendly staff just made the experience so much worse.,1
not a bad choice for a late night dining. food is average but was served quickly.,3
"small portions, overpriced and waiters rush you to pay when you didnt ask for the bill after your food. do not go here.",1
quite good food!,4
amazing food. best chinese in town,5
"really great chinese food here. come with friends to enjoy some really tasty and filling cuisine, with very accommodating service. cosy atmosphere, which is a nice change of pace from the bustling leicester square round the corner! ",4
"very good chinese food and cheap too. had beef stir-fry in black bean sauce, chicken satay and some prawn chow mein. food was very tasty and came very quickly",5
food is top quality it does was it says on this tin,5
"authentic cantonese food, quick service. but seat are not very comfortable",4
noodles and claypot dishes are good. stir frys arent great. dim sum very doughy. disappointed.,3
really good food for china town and very generous portions. service was also very quick but we went on a wednesday so not sure how busy it is during weekends. they have more space upstairs too,5
"unfriendly staff, quality of meals vary from day to day. sometimes laksa could be one of the best in london, other days it's dull and noodles are stuck in bundles. also i'm skeptical about the hygiene of cutlery used here.",1
a variety of authentic hong kong food and special drinks at a reasonable price. better than many cha chaan tengs in hong kong.,5
oh wow! rocky rocked the service and the chef rocked the food! thanks for a fab experience! go rocky an old town 97!!!,5
"value for money. food is nothing to shout about but the portion is huge for the amount paid. quick service, no frills. ",4
one of the staffs yelled at me and my friends just because he was impatient with us while taking orders. i was so shocked. the toilet was also very dirty/,1
"not bad usually and good choice when late at night since they open till 4am. fried noodles have wok hei, so could be rated higher depending on specific dishes ordered.",3
good food but unreasonable treatment,1
quick and easy for food. ,4
good soya chicken with fried rice,3
curry noodle aka laksa soup is to die for. and i'll request it as my last supper.,5
worst customer service ever. never come again. the attitude of the waiter is extremely terrible,1

one on the best kept secrets in china town.,5
dat lse fried rice saves my empty belly every saturday morning at 3,5
best chinese food that i have had.,5

disappointing beef ho fan. not much beef and a very sweet flavour.,2
very fast service and tasty food,4
"dont even  bother to go there .............their food small portion  ( basically  like pet food )    quality is ok , pricy",1
"i ordered a rice dish and then found out it has an 1-2 inch long worm in it after one bite!! it was just horrifying and disgusting!! the staff apologized multiple times and let me order something different. in the end, i was still being requested to pay for the meal after this terrible experience. never going back!",1
"schezuan-style chicken was not authentic/tasty  however, it may have been my choice of dish (this restaurant specializes in canton cuisine)",2
my gaffer introduced me to this place. what a lovely place it is. ,5
staff not friendly.,1
"good service, decent food, reasonable pricing",3
the staff seems constantly disturbed by customers presence. terrible atmosphere to dine in. food was decent,2

"this used to be my go to restaurant for roast duck rice, but not anymore. on the last couple of occasions, the duck had way too much fat and hardly any meat even though on the second time i complained about the first but still they served me the same.",2
food not bad but not the best ,3
only one restaurant open in midnight in downtown.,4
overpriced trash.,1
"food is ok, environment is very typical chinese restaurant",3
amazing time spent! ,5
"all-round cantonese, chinese, some malaysian and thai dishes.",4
always good for drunken night outs,4
"unfriendly staffs, they are chinese and differentiated us because we are vietnamese.if i could choose zero star, i would. almost the chinese staffs are unfriendly.",1
service isn't great but the food makes up for it,5
the tables are tiny and we found a total of 5 hairs in 3 dishes. ,3
"rude waiters, lame food",1
"perfect when you're starving after a night out but still quite drunk. ask for the lse fried rice, its a secret menu special ;)",5
the chicken with rice is their signature dish,4
good for a cheeky late night chinese,5
"food is normally pretty good, 24 hours so does get very busy when the clubs shut with lots of people comeing from soho",4
amazing authentic food that tastes close to the food we get at home. ,5
very rude staff. double charged my credit card and refused to reimburse the duplicate charge.,1
"lol e the food, this place is a lifesaver at 2am too ! quick and tasty chinese food.",4
reasonable price and the food is delicious. lse fried rice is a must. open till late at night for those munchies after clubbing,4
"open till early hours in the west end , good rotisserie eg roast duck , chicken and roast pork .",4
"ask for the out of menu ""lse fried rice"" served with egg gravy, fried egg and xo sauce on pork.",4

"i think this 217 "" fried fish head and pickled salted mustard vermicelli in soup"" is really yummy.",4
"one of my favourite stops for a hong kong milk tea, both hot and cold. not too sweet or bitter and quite reasonably priced compared to the bubble tea cafes.they also have a good selection of hotpots(claypot), do a really yummy salt and pepper pork and sweet and sour pork.",5
we ordered a hidden dish off the menu. it was really delicious.,5
open til very late. best place to go after drinking. efficient service just like how chinese like it ,5
good food and open very late. nice slightly more expensive alternative to the down-to-earth 'local eateries' up the road.,4
ordered from them via deliveroo. within hours of consumption ( ps i ate some of the  food as soon as it arrived ) i had gi symptoms ( vomiting and diarrhea) . earlier i had only tea and fruit . not sure if others have experienced this but please just be cautious.,1
"it's actually ok. if you're overrun by the possible choices: you can eat here! food is ok-to-good, service is nothing pleasant but if you've been traveling you will understand why. you shouldn't expect a warm smile. one note: they should care fore the toilet a little more.",4
"extremely rude service to asian customers. sit all white in ground/first floor, and all yellow skin in the highest floor which requires climbing steep steps. shameful! i will never come to this place again.",1
"recently left a bag there, not knowing.. 10 days later as i walk past there, the waiter recognized me and returned my bag! now that's what i call service :-) ps. i've always enjoyed the food!",5

"good food, location and price. just a bit of a small and tight restaurant.",4
"real chinese food , good prices, lots of choice, service was ok too",5
i recommend lse students to try the lse fried rice. it is a bit pricey but worth it.,4
best food i had in london chinatown.iclse is my favorite. special food for uni students.,5
i had never disappointed here. better than others. ,4
nice place to have a nice chinese meal after clubbing nearby. ,4
good for food late but nothing exceptional and at 8 for a pint of beer it's pricey if you a fancy a drink.,3
"been coming to this place for more than 20 years, open til 4am at weekends..highly recommend roast duck, char siu, crispy pork and egg fried rice",5
"opens very late at night, so it is a great place to grab food after a night out, but do not expect the best quality of food in comparison to the other restaurants around the chinatown area.",4
best chinese food in london! i've tried many but there is nowhere better!,5
"love this place.  quick,  good and cheap,  the best trilogy",4
great food. open till late. only con is that the staff is very rude.,4
decent quality food and very quick service.,4
food was very good from the set menu. only let down by the unfriendly service.,4
busy chinese restaurant in the heart of china town. numerous floors,4
better than average chinatown restaurant.,4
great staff and food. best place to go if you hungry at night,5
good food and ioen late,5
great food that opens late into the night,5
beef brisket ho fun was the business on a rainy day. in and out in 20 minutes (oo-er). take-out char kway teow (for consumption standing up) was generously proportioned too. they're open very late. will be back.,5
"not sure why so many negative reviews, food was excellent and very quickly served. i agree that they could be more friendly but that is just standard chinese mannerisms, since the food was great and served amazingly quick i have no complaints.",5
"asked for no nuts because of allergies.got told no nuts were in any of the dishes we wanted, and it should be completely safe.ruined the rest of the day, as there definitely was nuts in the dish - non-stop throwing up for hours (normally a sign of peanuts, which in other cases could be deadly).completely unacceptable, stay away!",1
"they charge 2 for extra fresh cut chiliseriously? such a rip-off! it was taken off after our protest. rice is stale, dishes are average. you will be hassled, and waiters rude. typical cantonese canteen style. not that clean.",1
"great food, get the off menu item, its called lse it comes standard as pork but you can ask for the chicken",5
"this is one of my favorite restaurants in chinatown. service is very efficient. i would highly recommend their crispy duck, it is one of the best i've had.",4
"convenient location, but service is hit or miss, food is ok for a quick asain fix but won't be going back soon",3
liked the lse fried rice! kungpo chicken was disappointing.,3
can't remember what it was called but the beef was sublime,5
"great place to go when in the area, food is always very good. and stays open very late, so even more perfect to go after a night out!",5
"roast meats are not bad, other dishes are so so.",3
the go-to place for late night meal,5
"had the crispy pork belly, which was excellent, although the rice was over fried, a but dry and hard in places.partner had the beef noodles which were delicious.food is very good, and served moments after ordering.the place itself isn't anything to look at, it's purely functional",4
i don't recommend this restaurant.not worth spending mony herevery unfriendly staff ruined our holidaythere are bunch of other chinese restaurants in soho better than here,1
poor customer service ever,1
"horrible restaurant. they served pre made gyoza and when we were concerned they had not served us what we requested our server started pushing my arm away from the dish, physically touching my arm. so wierd and horrid.",1
good to chill with drinking,3
"yes service is bad - so bad that the waitors want to scam you of paying more than is the actual price, had this experience when ordering take-away and the waitor pretended to not have known what he had done - shameful staff here, if it continues this will be reported to the food standards agency",1
"some of the best tasting chinese in chinatown - not the place to go if you are looking for friendly service, however.",4
"i was here back on 2015, and back again right now. i spent here like 3 times dinner during the past 2 weeks. foods is delicious, fast service, and good hospitality. feels like at home",5
one of the best chinese restaurants in chinatown. i'd recommend getting the salted egg wings or squid and their hidden dish ''lse fried rice'' which is their special fried rice served with tender pork smothered in egg sauce and topped with a fried egg.,4
the food was good but the waiters was so angry and aggressive. i felt like they were there to act mean. and they were throwing the cutleries and being rough,1
very rude staff and below average food. what makes it worse is that they try and overcharge you! there are much better restaurants to go to nearby but if you go here make sure you remember how much your meal actually costs otherwise they will try it with you too!,1
hands down the best customer service ive experienced. the food was great but the level of service just took it to another level. i think rick was the gentleman who served us. well definitely be going back,5
"if you want to eat good chinese food, this place i will never recommend",1
"five star purely for it does what you want. late night chinese food, pretty much a life saver if your after real chinese food late at night.",5
"the food here far exceeded my expectations. excellent good, fast albeit a bit gruff service. they forgot one of the dishes i ordered and i had no way to tell if it was on my bill because it was hand written in chinese script.",4
service was just bad! the waitress was so rude and agressive. we didn't want to pay the service charge because of this attitude but she did not let us and told us to just takeaway next time. additionally the food served was cold. not coming back.,1
"be cautious with compulsive extra 10% fee for the just ok service.meat with rice(without any vegetables, except for 2 slices of cucumber) is good and delicious, but you can get the same things with vegetables in other store with same price.lemon tee is a bit bitter, quality of the tee could be better.",2
good taste. plenty food.,5
not the best tbh.. soup was cold and noodles  were tasteless..  had to even ask for chilly. and additional charge was applied on payment desk..,2
tried to scam us to pay more. rude,1
very very friendly food was lovely make u feel welcome ,5
i wish i could undo my experience at this place,1
my family and i have a good experience. the menu is quite big. very good selection of soups and they are very tasty. stuff is very friendly and nice. i will recommend this restaurant ,5
since i moved to london. this place has beenbeen and favourite place.,5
great food in this small but busy chinese. brisket was nice and they go out the way to help you. very good,4
"my co-workers and i order from here every friday to cure our hangovers, or just because we feel like being naughty on fridays. i recommend the beef ho fun noodles in black bean sauce. on my two occasions in store, service was fast but very basic. don't expect to be engaged or pampered much!",5
"ordered chicken fried rice... nothing was fried in that dish and chicken was simply raw. when asked to bring a cooked meal they brought the same plate after microwaving it for a few minutes.. but hey, at least i'm still alive",1
"busy little place. ordered the hainanese chicken rice. it was good but the chicken was a bit too mushy for my liking, although i am used to more elastic chicken. huge portions. head downstairs to the toilet and you might just hear some energetic chinese music being played in the kitchen!!",4
"not attentive waiters, even wrongly took three orders and didn't want to take responsibility. the food is good but the service is cringeworthy.",1
it has a secret menu lse fried rice which is really good. other dishes are ok.,3
"this is a one dish restaurant, we only go there because of the salt & pepper crab which is extremely tasty, but unfortunately all other dishes fall notably below those available in china town",3
"an overpriced chinese eatery. food is mediocre at best, even before taking into account of the exorbitant prices. skip it unless its the last one standing.",1
good place to go when others are closed. it costs slightly more because of that but would say the quality is higher than average,4
great for late night after party feasting.,4
"never tasted chinese food this bad!!! do yourself a favor and stay away from this restaurant! food quality 1/10, service 0/10, staff 1/10, hygiene 1/10. believe me or you can find out yourself.",1
great food all the time 24/7 greatness,5
"at 2 am? the food was delicious. we ordered the crispy belly pork, egg fried rice and beef with black been sauce and onions. what a great place especially after a night out. they have plenty of staff that will attend to you and tables available too. highly recommend.  ",5
very oily food and taste so so. service is slow. wont come back again.,1
really bad hygiene conditions. ordered a bubble tea and discovered a hair in my drink. the staff was also rude. food is okay but i'm never coming back. there tons of better places in china town. stay away from this one!!,1
fast service and open late. best wings in london!,5
wow.amazing food and a late closing.my new favourite chinese restaurant.,5
"ate here with 3 friends last night and they were all instantly sick after eating the food here. not only that but the bill came in chinese not english so couldnt understand any of it, and we were massively over charged. wont be eating here again",2
"good food, quick service but definitely on the pricey side. 60 meal for two vegetarians at a low end decor/ takeout chinese restaurant!",3
staff are rude. they do not care if you are waiting. the food is okay tasty. the service really lets it all down. no culture barrier included,3
"rude and terrible service, food not authentic",1
average  food. more expensive than others around the immediate area. charges extra for anything extra including fresh chilli. not worth it in my opinion. also rude manager who adds the bill up in chinese so you dont exactly know what your paying for. go to the place next door,2
best chinese in london for 3am dine in noodles.,5
very good service and food 10/10,5
"dont waste your time with this place, terrible staff particularly the manager.they lied about prices and purposely try to overcharge people. food half decent but not worth the hassle.never again",1
it was late and still had a decent meal at midnight..,5
"good chinese food, the restaurant was a bit dirty and too small.",3
"i can't believe there's such a ppace in london like this. so third world, attitude's unimaginably uncivilized. the management's so ignorant of londoners' customer care. my friend and i tried to understand the behavior but it was so offensively boorish. it was a mistake dining there!",1
"overcharging, tourist trap.",1
"shame on you, old town 97!! you're a mess! sort out your deliveroo because you're stealing money from customers for food that you're incapable to make or deliver! what a mess!! don't advertise that you deliver food if you can't do so!! incompetent....waste of time 1 star is 1 too many.",1
"my favourite chinese restaurant in the area. i always get takeaway when im able to and its perfect for wholesome chinese food even at 4am (which is not the case for most places at that time)highly recommend for dinner, or a 4am snack ;)",5
i had noodles with chopped pork on christmas day and it was just amazing! one of the best i've ever eaten! definitely will come back if i'm near china town!,5
great small chinese restaurant. very reasonable prices. food is very tasty and plenty of it. spiced nicely in my case. chicken in black bean sauce. house wine was very nice. always seems to be busy,4
"bad hygiene conditions , rude staff.",1
"love this place, it has flaws such as rude staff that speak way to loud but if you know what to order you are at the right chinese spot in china town!",5
not good as its mentioned in all the review.  i ordered thefried rice and wonton noodles soup.  the fired rice is really dry and hard to swallow.  the wonton noodle soup has no taste at all.  overall not a good choice if you are looking for authentic chinese food.,1
"food's not bad, but the service was terrible.  rude waiting staff, poor speaking tone, dismissive, inconsiderate.",2
"the best thing to get here is the cantonese duck and rice, probably one of the best i've had it in most places worldwide but everything on the menu here is top quality. they don't use that low density meat you find with many chinese restaurants they use proper cuts of steak and chicken.",5
opens till early hours of the morning so good for when you're stumbling in after a night out but food and service subpar.,2
paid 20 for two plates of inedible vegetables. terrible service and terrible food. literally couldn't even eat the food. i told them i was severely allergic to shellfish and they essentially ignored me.,1
decent place and lots of choices. price quality is about right.,3
nice noodles,5
"amazing food. i give four star because the service is quite poor, but seriously good price and excellent food.",4
"pretty good food and the sesame oil chicken hit the spot on the cold day. a bit expensive though, for what it is, even for london. good for occasional taiwanese eating out. the atmosphere is authentically crowded and simple too (for those who like that, i know i do)",4
"food is nice,portion size is pretty small. i don't know why i am paying service charge since it's non-existant",2
"the food is great but the service is terrible. the staff are impolite, not happy that they gave my judging eyes when i told them i have no coins.",3
"great price to taste ratio; hard to find a cheaper place in the area. i recommend the fried chicken. it's a bit sweeter than you might expect, but very nice. ",5
"fastastic taiwanese restaurant! quite authentic, food is great!",5
small little restaurant with great food and the friendliest owners ever !!!!,5
"decent taiwanese comfort food, but overpriced for the small-ish portion sizes. very cramped seating area and cash-only with a mandatory service charge for eat-in.",3
food is nice. portion can be more generous,4
the most authentic taiwanese restaurant in london that ive found.,5
food and price are reasonably great. service is just okay,5
cute traditional taiwanese street food place.,4
great food and friendly service,5
tasty food and great bubble tea.,5
food was authentic and tasted very nice. slightly pricey for its portion but i would still go back again.,5
the fried chicken cutlet was very delicious and price reasonable! did not disappoint.,4
"rude and emotionless waitress, small potions and the prices are like 3x of those in taiwan",1
"great service, cute wooden interior and such a lovely reminder of the flavours of home. not 100% the flavours you get in taiwanese night markets but probably the closest you can get in london!",5
cash only. great taiwan food.,5
really good taiwanese food,5
"the food is good, but the customer service is really really bad. i dont know why the restaurant is cash only, and they only accept to pay the notes rather than coins. he said we wasted his time, and a lot of people are waiting for us. actually we only wasted his time for less than 2mins!",1
please dont go to this restaurant!!!!the service its terrible. the owner or administrator literally yelled at us because we stayed 5 minutes talking after the plates were removed. he was so violent that i'll file a report with the police. by so far was the worst restaurant experience of all my life.,1
"very small but a unique dining experience. interesting and delicious drinks. if you like random pig bits (feet, etc) you'll love this. the taiwanese sausage is excellent too. also try their salt and pepper squid which is very authentic.",5
"tiny space, but the food is really good. fried chicken, pork sausage, spicy beef noodle soup, chicken noodle soup with sesame oil are dishes that i normally go for.",5
"really liked this little cafe. home style taiwanese food is not easy to find in london. noodles are really fresh and delicious, as was salt & pepper squid and chicken. portion sizes are sensible and cost is a real bargain. will definitely stop by again",4
"as a taiwanese, the food is trash honestly. even the beef flavored instant noodle is better comparing the beef noodle there..fried chicken tastes dry with thick breaded. the taro milk tea was obviously blending with artificial flavor. faked af..last..even my grumpy grandma is nicer than the waitresses.. disgrace of taiwan",1
"authentic taiwanese street food, affordable food that will not disappoint. the taiwanese braised pork rice (3.50) and the taiwanese sausages (6.50) are must tries! this is a small restaurant with limited seating, so expect a short wait of around 10 min if you visit during rush hours.",4
"a little pricey for taiwanese street food, but understandable given its in central london. its definitely the best classic bubble tea in town.",4
"i love taiwanese food but this place is such a let down. the ""signature"" beef noodle is steeped in oil to make up for a lack of ten necessary ingredients to make it a proper broth. others have said enough about the bad service - cold faces without a smile.",1
"great taiwanese food, recommend!",5
taiwanese street food.  in many individual size portions.,5
"lovely taiwanese food, if the service can make the customers feels like in taiwan it must perfect",5
surprisingly ok for a tiny hole in the wall,5
classic taiwanese dishes! great for a quick bite.,4
"really amazing, my god the fried chicken, oyster omelette, minced pork noodles were off the charts. just the best thing ever! brings me back to when i was in taiwan. (singaporean here)",5
"very nice hearty taiwanese food, noodles to fried chicken and perfect steamed vegetables. and still friendly. a bit cramped but it's street food!",5
really yummy and traditional taste of taiwanese food. felt so happy when i had my salt and pepper chicken!!,5
the taste is not like any restaurant in taiwan very disappointing all my friends can cook better than the chef,1
didn't eat here but the staff were lovely. we were having a drink in the pub next door who wouldn't let our children use the toilet due to the license but these guys offered to let the kids use their staff toilet. outstanding.... thank you.,5
not great if vegetarian but very friendly staff and good service.,3
"horrible customer service. truly one of the worst customer service i have ever had at a restaurant. staff were rude, condescending and unwilling to help customers.",1
"traditional taiwanese food in the heart of london. loved it since i have been there for the first time 3 years ago. tiny place, but def worth to squeeze in",5
a small place just off the main china town strip. food is very good. tables are  slightly small and was slightly rushed when you have finished. very typical for a small place that need the table. food made up for it,4
"really good and local taiwanese food. although i'm not taiwanese, the food made me remember the time when i'd been living in taiwan.",5
"on the expensive side and my noodle soup was pretty much only noodles. very cramped. staff friendly enough, other dishes were tasty.",3
i am never let down at this small taiwanese restaurant. it's a consistent favourite!! i recommend the noodle soup and salt and pepper chicken,5
"small restaurant, expect to share tables with others.typical hong kong style service (not friendly service).accepts cash only with 10% on top.",1
best taiwanese food ive had in london. located in central london between chinatown and soho. i recommend the spicy beef noodles. taiwanese sausage and chicken cutlet were also very good. yes the place is small and cramped but worth a try if you never had taiwanese food before. i thought the prices were decent. id go back again.,4
"food was tasty and reasonably priced. place doesn't look like much, is cramped and the waitresses don't smile much but wouldn't call them rude. the place feels pretty authentic, and my friend said the food reminded him of home, so we all thought it was great!",5
"great taiwanese food in chinatown. food is authentic, prices are reasonable.  this place is cash only! tables are shared and you can only be seated once your whole group has arrived.",4
"these guys do not mess about when it comes to hot food.  lesson number 1.   the broth was like a chilli mace at times ( in a good way). service was quick, to the point. no faffing. had the beef noodles based on all the reviews. was good.  little oily towards the end.  .worth a visit.",3
super good! quite authentic taiwan flavor. staff are friendly.,5
"the food was not bad, close to real taiwanese food. but the services could be better. i knew it's busy but it's not customers' fail, please don't wear a long face.",3
good food! awful service! awful!,2
"needed a quick meal before the theatre, and this was very quick. food tasted authentic and service was fast and brusque which suited us just fine. so much better than the average chinese restaurants in the area.will come again",5
when i lived in london. i missed the food in taipei.i went there with my friend. the taste of  is almost the same at home. and i can hearchinese there. it warmed my heart.,4
"the food was really tasty, though a little expensive. definitely try the sandwich!",4
small. food was good.  they only took cash payment so thank fully we had some on us.,3
it's a pretty narrow place but the food is nice and tasty,4
"great taiwanese food. the place is cozzy, busy always, makesure to drop by as you may be in china town near by.",5
very very bad serviceand never recommend it for anyone,1
real authentic taiwanese food,5
traditional taiwan food in london. the portion is good for the price and the taiwan sausage is a must try!,5
salt & pepper chicken with rice was really good!,5
"authentic taiwanese food, and the taiwan fried chicken is always a must try.",5
offered decent quick taiwanese bites. also reasonably priced considering its location in the london city centre.,4
very authentic and friendly taiwanese restauranted tucked in the edge of the soho. their taiwanese fried chicken and beef noodle is a must! expect 15 per head including starter + main. two cons are very tight seating space and only acceptes cash here.,5
"taiwan authentic local food restaurant in china town, place is compact, busy.",4
"tasty, filling, and well priced street food. quick service. goid atmosphere.",5
authentic taiwanese place! its delicious! altho the staff is not welcoming and friendly at all.,4
"absolutely outstanding authentic food. dan dan noodles delicious and the squid outstanding, dumplings great to. thank you for a great experience.",5
"no card machine, charge 10% service fee while there is no service except their poker faces. really tiny seats. food was ok.",2
great food. good service. no real wait times. recommend highly!,5
foods were amazing and the staff members were lovely! im coming again tomorrow!,5
"good food, friendly stafffavorite in london",5
satisfied with everything.,5
good music playlist !,5
really good food and service,5
delicious!! but quite expensive with drinks etc,4
"tasty, too little meat, overpriced",3
"we met with friends at this restaurant for dinner. my friend recommended this spot.  well, it was very successful. the crew welcomed us with a smile and we had a great feeling. the food was just great. we loved this place a lot and we will definitely return to this restaurant. keep it up.",5
"very good quality cuts of meat. the best item out of their platter is king prawns; very fresh! one of the best prawn i've ever tasted. very nice atmosphere with friendly staffs. aside from delicious bbq, other korean dishes are pretty average.",5
well designed tables with a self-service grill in the middle. great atmosphere and attentive staff. it would have been a 4 star review if the food was a little tastier.,3
"it was fantastic! olle is the best korean restaurant ive  ever visited in london. i felt like i am in south korea. if you are not sure what to order, please show this picture. it will be perfect choice to taste proper korean food : )",5
"the food was good but not much options like what other korean cuisine restaurant does. and no any korean side dish to be served, not at all. staff wasnt rude but the service wasnt that present too. just show you a i dont care face. slow serving. and wont greet you any nor respond to our thanks.",2
"the food is really tasty! good service, perfect night out with my friends. can get quite loud but good atmosphere overall. would definitely come back!",5
"amazing barbecue! i have eaten at many korean barbecue restaurants in south korea and olle is just as good. i highly recommend the pork belly. the tofu and pork stew is also delicious. service and ambiance is also exceptional. so if you're hunting for the best korean bbq, you've found it!",5
"enjoyed the window views, communal table and signed bts cards at cash register area.  the meats were plentiful and delectable. i enjoyed my experience here and the price was reasonable.",5
"really nice place, not expensive and nice staff. i'm specially grateful to the young blonde lady that took my bill, i'm not sure if her interest was genuine or not but very nice and helpfull. best 10 tips i've given, well deserved. amazing food, recommend 100%",5
so good. went for the tasty burning bowl that is bibimbap. the bbq looks and smells like a 5 star experience. will be going back for that.,4
the place serves large portions and for affordable pricing. friendly staff. they never disappoint.,5
"while the ""olle beef selection"" tasted amazing, the service was not doing its part in making the experience enjoyable. no assistance was provided (and i don't think we looked like we really knew what we were doing), no refill of salad once the plate was empty, no comment on what sides would make sense with our order. just nothing.",3
"had a lovely meal colleagues, food was great. careful of the grape soju, you can forget how much you have had",5
honestly.  i enjoyed a lot. delicious  food. the staff it was very nice,5
the waiter here didnt let us in while we were waiting and told us to que outside the restaurant only. and they didnt tell us how long is the waiting time until we asked ! im fine with waiting but not under this kind of weather condition!!! rude!,1
"it was really delicious! next time ill try the bbq, everything was fresh and delicious.",5
"great food, on the pricey side but the food was worth it. servers (when i went) were friendly and efficient. (no side dishes but i'll live with that). but to the one lady server: don't underestimate your foreign customers. we understood quite well.",4
"this is authentic korean bbq place! self-grilled, well-organised, fresh veg, good quality of korean pork belly. highly recommend you to visit.",4
"excellent korean food. one of the best in london. the bulgogi was standard. the la galbi and pork belly were amazing, could really taste the difference from other korean places in london. topokki with cheese was also pretty special. and the fired chicken is another must have. have been twice now and will be back again.",5
great exceptional bbq in london & friendly environment ....,5
the best korean food and bbq in london. service is excellent. highly recommended.,5
a bit pricey but excellent taste,4
something different and a good price,4

quite expensive but very high quality. i'm told this is the authentic taste of korean bbq. the service was exceptional.,4
excellent korean bbq cuisine... recommend to anyone that is looking to have more than just a great night!,5
"wont recommend this , the price is exorbitant ,while the food is just average. more importantly , they asked us to leave after paying the bill because the table was bookedwhich is nonsense.",1
amazing place. food is incredible!!!,5
royal disappointment. there are no side dishes nor rice serve with your meal. food is over price and service was extremely poor. what a real shame to korean food.,1

very friendly staff and great food!,5
good experience! good food! i like it!,4

best wagyu i've ever eaten. awesome restaurant!!,5
bbq is a bit pricey but overall the food is very good and nice environment and staff.,5
the best korean resturent in london.bbq set menu is delicious and price is reasonable ....,5
best one in london,5
great surprise find,5
"nice food, lovely service and good prices",5
"best korean restaurant in london, exquisite meat quality and worth all the money. its a must go x",5
had to wait 30 minutes for the meat to come out. 40 for rice and kimichi soup. other people who came later got their food first. expensive. they took away the lettuce that came with the meat without asking.,2
"wont recommend it!! galbi was  the taste is horrible.  kfc (korean fried chicken) is a joke, i have been to south korea several time and tried the kfc .. can u explain how come it cost 11 pounds for not even cooking it in a korean way ? i had a bad experience for my new year lunch!!!! im so pissed off",1
the waitress cooked the meat for us and the set menu came with a good selection of meats. the quality of the meat was also very high.,5
good place! nice food!,5
"nice foods, nice service, friendly staff, reasonable price. will come back again.",5
authentic korean food. absolutely amazing! service and atmosphere was great,5
"nice place to eat with friend ,nice place to talk when u eat bbq . good quality  foods and best bbq ever. good stuffs, kind ,helpful .",5
"good service and good korean bbq, portions maybe could be a bit better. we ate the middle bbq selection b for three people, a mixed kitchen starter and  bimbap. overall lovely but the bbq selection culd have been a bit more.wine overpriced, we got the bordeaux for c. 33",3
great service but slightly pricey for the amount of meat you get. great taste though!,4
great korean barbecue ! be prepared to be on a waiting list on a friday or on saturday !,4
"i was very impressive about the interior, just like original. i eat kimchicigge and pork barbecue and was delicious. piece was very good too.",5
food was ok...the waiter though was a bit unfair as he let us order way too much food for 2 pax... literally it was for 4 people,3
one of the staff was very rude and was arguing over an order we didn't place. she had a rude tone and was insisting that she was right without actually understanding us. price was alright but the service itself was not that great. definitely not going back.,2
"great atmosphere, cozy seating, good food and kind staff. i don't think you can ask for anything more.",5
just had a really rude phone call. they didn't listen to me at all but saying they don't receive the saturday reservation and hung up the phone. the website didn't say anything like that. i haven't tried their foods but a phone call made me feel bad enough not to try at all.,1
really good~ thank you,5
"food was delicious! something to improve: water service. they only fill you glass (a very small glass) and don't leave the water on the table. if you want more water you have to ask, they don't come spontaneously.",4
"food is amazing, service and location are nice as well. not too cheap, but worth it",4
overpriced.  bit boring with indifferent staff and little cultural experience.  82 for two people for a basic meal with one bowl of rice and one beer.  food quality was good but not exceptional.  wont go back.,2
food was alright but too exspensive. service was slow. can definitely be better overall for the prices they charged.,2
excellent,5
not enough valuable...........,2
great quality meat with amazing service. would recommend coming with friendsand family or social events.,5
you have to try the grape soju,5
very delicious and friendly staffs,5
you get to cook on a stone,4
 my favorite korean bbq place in london ,5

the food was great and service was very helpful. i will be coming back soon!,5
"bbq on your table itself. the prices are a bit high. portion sizes are small and the meat items served were not marinated, which i felt tasteless when compared to our house bbq's. the staff were very friendly and helpfull. we went to the basement and very tight spaces.",3
perfect service.perfect food.,5
loved the food. great portions. maybe a little too expensive but ok.,4
fantastic korean bbq cuisine - enjoyed my time there and the staff were quite friendly!,5
"if you are craving for a proper korean bbq with quality olle is a must visit. the ingredients are fresh, the food is amazing and authentic and the staff are helpful. the only downside is you'll smell of bbq afterwards (which is inevitable in bbq places)",5
meat is vv nice and great service ,5
"poor poor poor poor pooor poooor service. really unfriendly. they lock the door to keep people outside once they have a full house. so disappointed, good food but such bad service.",1
great food and staff members were really nice too. would come again for sure. ,5
"great food, me and my friends went for all 3 sharers (we were very hungry!) and it was worth it.",5
good food! good staff. but 1.5h wait time,4
i loved the food and the saff were really nice . will definitely come back.highly recommended to my family and friends.,5
had better in nottingham but it's decent,3
"nice and helpful staff, nice atmosphere, but we felt the food was not worth the price. pretty basic korean bbq which lacked in flavour.",3
"amazing food, staff slightly cheeky, but i didnt mind. overall good experience and the place is wheelchair accessible.",5
we had a good experience overall. staff were attentive and accommodating. a bit expensive and they have a big service charge.,4
i really recommend this place. nice service and decent korean bbq.,5
very nice bbq restaurant with table grills,5
the female manager.. rude & unkind. the food tastes like authentic korean but covered with full of artificial seasonings.. never authentic in reality. slow service and dirty tables. never go there again.,1
had a great experience at olle. great service and quality of foods. will visit here again!,5
good korean bbq in great location. reasonable price with friendly staff made my lunch wonderful.,4
"reasonable prices, amazing food and lovely staff",5
"lovely staff, food was great. nice selection and set meals. overall really nice, great with groups.",5

"tasty korean food, and very nice service and price.",5
"gorgeous food, reasonably priced.",5
too much msd and dirty. charge on every single side dishes. wont go there again.,1
food is very good. very busy and feels crowded ... difficult to feel relaxed.,3
amazing food!!! i am originally from seoul so i know what it's authentic korean food. olle is proper place to taste korean food in london. highly recommend!! all meats for bbq was fantastic!!! was impressed with stylish plates and great service too. my friends and i enjoyed a lot!!!definitely go there again!!,5
"really good restaurant, we ve tried several korean restaurants (4) and it s one of the best! (real korean taste)",5
overpriced and taste nothing special. and portion is too small compare to price.interior and atmosphere is nice but won't be back.,2
"this is very excellent, it is great to go out there and eat with your family. the food is very good, we will like to visit there again someday.",5
"hmmm, i found galbi here as i used to have in la.great",5

best korean bbq place ever staff was kind and food was very high quality. want to visit again.,5
amazing service and the food was perfection definitely recommend this to everyone,5
"that 54 pounds worth of meat for two. good atmosphere, little pricy.",4
"the food is good and would genuinely recommend it, but the staff is very disorganized.",2
"bit expensive, but barbeque is definitely worth it.lively, relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff.",5
"pricing is on the expensive side, the meat quality is superb, lacked the traditional korean sides. having to pay for kimchi is a first. customer service was excellent.",3

great food great service! best bbq restaurant in london,5
"a bit busy on the night so we couldn't get a bbq table sadly. however the other menu items were tasty and me and my girlfriend had a very enjoyable experience. -1"" is only because they forgot about my partners meal so she had to wait about 20/25mins for her food when i was near finished.",4
absolutely stunning meat and kimchi! friendly staff that is always there to help.,5
"i thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant, the staff is nice and very attentive. the venue is pretty small but the space is put to good use. you can sit by the window and people watch as you cook your korean bbq. the ingredients are very fresh.",5
saw this new restaurant being busy so decided to give it a try.the menu here for korean bbq is not cheap and portions not very generous either.the quality of the meat is decent but definitely not worth the prices.they even charge for condiments like lettuce.not recommended.,2
"great bbq korean restaurant, food was tasty but a bit overpriced and you have to pay for kimchi and no side dish provided though.",3
"the food was great, almost as a bbq in korea. the price was a bit expensive.",4

my favourite korean barbecue in town!!!my 5 or 6 times visit already.using very high quality and fresh meat. cutting way is professional. can enjoy different texture and flavour from different part of meat. good price for premium grade a5 japanese wagyu. brisket and tartar are so delicious.meat lovers heaven.,5
the bbq was super and about 30 per person. we had the set meal for two and then some sides and extras. the korean tea was good and the bbq hot and clean.,5
"a great korean bbq house! there is a spacious downstairs area so if upstairs is busy, don't be put off! staff are friendly and attentive and happy to make any recommendations. great for large groups, just remember to book ahead. restroom facilities are clean.",5
so poor service even there is not full booked they just hitting my chair without apologize and i cant see anyone of staff for my meal except payment.,1
"small korean restaurant with an ok sized menu to choose from, however you will need to share table with other customer.  the food is fresh and selection a and b are full of meet. have not seen any kids menu and the restaurant does not have enough space for push chairs.",3
great hotpot. fun experience.,4
really enjoyed my meal here. staff are great and the food is amazing,5
"such great food! love all the things on menu, definitely recommend!",5
"best quality meat in london, friendly staff, reasonable price, i would definitely visit again!",5

fun experience. somehow i expected the korean food to be more spicy.,4
service is slow. food is good a bit expensive,4
the beef was very tasty and the tteokbokki as well. my friend wanted to go here since someone from bts was there :d,5
fantastic food with really helpful staff.we were part of a big party which came at different times and the staff were very accommodating. the food was also fantastic and i cant wait to come back for more.korean bbq is a must try at this place!,5
food is amazing try the pork belly. host are lovely but i wish theyd let me do the grilling bit more ,5
nice bbq. but watch out because you smell grease after dinner,5
"great experience at olle! the seasoning and marblization of the meat were perfect! bibimbap and korean fried chicken were delicious as well. the only downside is that it's a bit on the pricey side for the amount of serving you get. however, the quality is great.",4
"enjoyed the food as a korean customer. authentic korean bbq and nice selection. the kimchi chigae was delicious. only complaint is that the ventilation could be better, so after dinner my suit/clothes smelled like korean bbq (which happens at most korean restaurants so i guess its not uncommon)",4
menus are a bit tatty and the service a bit forgetful but the food's great. i would go again.,3
only going because bts was here :),5
"amazing food, real korean experience, lovely staff. especially recommend the pork belly ()!",5
"the korean bbq was absolutely delicious, and the interior was really nice. only thing that takes a star off was the hot pot at the end. it was quite flavourless.",4
"i visited korean restaurant with my friend and it was so disappoint. we paid just under 100 pounds for small portion of bbq and 2 hot stone pot bibibbop. the consist of set menu were cheap meat like pork belly, 120g of rib eye steak and etc and it cost 56pouns plus service charge.",1
"great food, especially the korean bbq. the wagyu steak is to die for. you won't regret! good selection  of korean drinks as well! overall 5 stars :))",5

love the food...,5
reasonable price,4
"the food dishes and table bbq is very good and tasty! the restaurant has 2 floors but it seems that friday, saturday & sunday are particularly busy, so reservation is required to avoid waiting. definitely recommend for authentic korean food.",5
so-so,3
"delicious. however, they charge you on everything including pieces of lettuce.",4
"what a great experience, staff was polite and the food - well you can eat your heart out! nice place for korean bbq",4
very high quality.,5
"digesting service booked for 4 people at 12 noon for 7 pm booking. walked in at 7pm, said there was no booking, no table and no apology.disgusting attitudeavoid like the plague",1
i'm a very fussy person but the food was amazing. there was not a thing i didn't like. it was a bit pricey but definitely worth it.,5
"great experiences, good qualtiy of food!!",5
the food was good and the staff was very polite and helpful but the potion was too less for the price we paid.,3
great food & service is quick. staff very helpful too. highly recommended,5
pricey and the bbq was very average with small portion sizes. only went to introduce my partner to korean bbq. won't be coming back,2
nice service from attentive korean staff. delicious korean bbq. good wine!,5
excellent food and wonderful staff. this was our first time eating korean barbecue and our waitress was extremely kind and helpful. try the korean tea- it's barley and it's excellent.,5
it was perfect. we have been two times and the waiters where super nice to us . they explain us what everything was and help us tu cook the food. i totally recommend this place.,5
"i loved my first time, it's a different experience. for 4 of us the bill came to 197 but we had a few plates and drinks so. but staff are nice and friendly and it's in a good location.",4
delicious authentic korean foodbut services is really bad.will be a really nice place for korean food if you dont mind the horrid service.,3

great experience and the food was brilliant.,5
"not a cheap eat, but a great experience! had the barbecue and everything was delicious! meat looked really fresh and tastes great",5
"be careful with this place. we went there yesterday and half of the people ended sick, food poisoning. we ordered a barbecue with beef, pork, some vegetables and shrimp.bad experience.",1
best korea barbecue in londonbest beef and kimchi,4
"great food, we order the meat mix for two people and it was more than enough to fill both of us up. great place, fast service but a little expensive (not much if we keep in mind that the restaurant is in midtown).",5
"good food, especially the salad!",4
amazing tastylicious food,5
great food and portions. good service.,5
fantastic meal,4
"lovely place, quite overcrowded on weekends.",4
not the best combination between price and quality.,3
friendly and very attentive staff (constantly cutting the bbq meat for us). good food. small and cozy venue so great for quiet private time. the only con is selection of pickled vegetables is small and the quantity of vegetables given with the bbq is a bit on the small side,4
"queuing time is too long, discriminating against chinese faces, not in line with the order. rubbish restaurant.",1
"interesting drinks for sure, but the place is expensive and they charge your for things you didn't order like water and nuts. we ended up paying 40  for two drinks. also no one smiles at the place which give it that hazy opium atmosphere.",3
cool experience. a little expensive,4
fresh and succulent  dim sumwe went for lunch and really enjoyed all the dim sums.  very welcoming and polite staff.  the food was freshly prepared and excellent service.  i would definately recomend this restaurant for an exquisite  eating experience.,5
took my dad here when he visited london. the dumplings are beyond excellent! and their cocktail selection is extensive and they taste wonderful. very informative and friendly staff,5
"amazing food, amazing cocktails and amazing vibe! love the decor too. if you love dim sum and/or funky cocktails, then i would highly recommend opium! a little obscure to find - look for the teal/green door - then be ready to ascend lots of stairs, but it's worth it!",5
cocktails were expensive & a little too complex. ordering a drink is like playing roulette. cute place though.,3
the teams at the peony and the apothecary bars made sure that my visits were a constant delight. their attention to detail and their skill made my visits unique and entertaining. my guests and i loved the atmosphere and the staff.,5
great expierence in both taste and serving.,5
what a lovely drinking and dining experience at opium. multiple floors of magical vibes. i recommend the dim sum platter. i lived many years in asia and it's definitely up to par. the cocktails were subtle and not overdone,5
amazing place great service,5
tasty cocktails!,4
meh cocktails,3
pretty niche,4
lovely little hideaway,5
there are a lot of stairs but the food and ambiance are well worth it.,4
love the drinks! old school but new,5
"great mocktails, the staff were very friendly and the atmosphere was great. the music was just the right volume so you could have a conversation without having to shout, which was a nice change from most other places i have been to.",5
"great cocktails, super friendly staff and a great atmosphere!",5
the quality of the cocktails reflects this. so i do feel that when it comes to the drinks you kind of get what you pay for.,4
"really fun cocktail bar, each cocktail was specially designed with a story and presentation.",5
great cocktails and different rooms suitable for both dates and meeting up with friends. bartenders are friendly.,5
delicious dumplings & lychee martinis! highly recommend!,5
amazing food and the cocktails went straight to my head. well worth the hangover and food baby. will be back soon.,5
"we were told we couldn't sit on the sofa because there were only two of us, despite hardly anyone being in the place. other than that, it had a reasonably nice atmosphere and the old fashioned i had was very good (albeit expensive)i don't like pretentious places like this, but if you do, it's probably the place for you.",2
fun place to go but id definitely recommend making a reservation. its not the sort of place id go every weekend but its very vibey inside and the drinks were pretty good.,4
great time after hiurs,4
great experience! you not only get good dim sum but also get good cocktails. would recommended the king prawns and lobster dumplings! super yummy!,4
look for the green door next to the dim sum restaurant and prepare to be amazed.,5
very cool bar. nondescript location. small so expect to wait in line on the weekend (or book ahead).  meant to look like an opium den. very cool spot for a date. drinks were amazing.,5
"overpriced, drinks below average! walked into peony to try out the cocktails, inexperienced staff, waited 30 minutes for a drink because the staff served somebody who arrived 20 mins after us first. the drink we got was awful. looked like a bubble bath in a cup. tasted like washing up liquid. never again!",2
great cocktails with a small menu of dim sum. good table service and friendly staff.,4
"very nice location, great music, cocktails were good but for 14-16 i would have expected something more spectacular. i'm very happy i tried it, but i'm not sure i will go back.",4
we were lucky to get in and loved the cocktails. next time i cant wait to try the dim sum which looked great!,5
one of the best bars i have been to in london. the ambience of this place is super amazing. this place will keep your mood gripped to its theme every damn second. they have the most innovative cocktails. it might feel a bit pricey but its worth every penny,5
lovely hidden bar with relaxed atmosphere. perfect for a nice date or pre/post dinner cocktail.,5
"awfully customer service, door man extremely rude. simple asked how long the wait would be for 4 of us as it was raining. doorman said we were being ""mouthy"" which is impressive for us only being there 2 minutes.  when we asked to speak to the manager he refused. very disappointed as we were excited to go here.",1
been here a few times and just love everything about it! super fun yummy drinks and dim sum. what more can you ask?? great vibe and nice staff with a confident location in chinatown.,5
"great dumplings and great atmosphere. a nice spot for a date with someone special, or a catch-up with good friends.",5
secret bar up lots of stairs. ideal for a romantic drink. i hope to have one like that one day.,5
"a bit expensive but it was well worth it. no pictures as we were too busy enjoying the music, the ambiance and the delicious cocktails. there are quite a lot of fancy cocktail bars at the moment that have cool gimmicks but here they also tasted delicious. highly recommend this place, but maybe after payday.",5
"an amazing bar. we visited on new year's eve, at around 7pm. we'd booked in advance, but the area we sat in was pretty quiet. we were a group of 10 and ordered a few drinks each - uniformly great cocktails and a super friendly set of bartenders and servers. i'd heartily recommend it.",5
dont go unless you love to be treated very rudely outside the door. much better places for cocktails in london and treating people with much more respect for the same price.,1
pricey but calm in the middle of hectic china town. could do with a better decor.,4
"pricey but full of character.each drink takes on a soul and is completely unique.this bar is at its best when all floors are open and the front door is closed.if you know, you know.",5
"so bad! tasteless cocktails, full of ice. one was served in a tiny child's like cup?? dim sum ok, nothing special at all. place is all hype and nothing substantial. music totally random. waste of time and money. far better food drinks and atmosphere elsewhere.",1
the dim sum here is delish! good range of cocktails and if you can't find anything you fancy they are happy to oblige and make a custom drink. great customer service too.,5
one of the best cocktail bars i have been to. we really enjoyed the atmosphere and the service. the cocktails are prepared and served with so attention to details that is a pleasure just to look at them. definitely recommended!,5
"great place for a first date as it seems more exclusive than it actually is. service/drinks/dim sum is very good. the main negatives is that they cram everyone in so there's not much space along with it be pretty expensive. so not somewhere i'd go for a drink in town, but certainly somewhere i'd take a partner or first date.",5
cocktails were absolutely beautifully made and really interesting. bar was very cool with excellent music. food to die for but limited. great atmosphere - will return!,5
super fun drinks!! nice cozy atmosphere with a 70s decor. feels like saigon during the vietnam war.,5
this is such a cool venue. you  will probably only find it if it's recommended. long climb to get to the bar but a very interesting space. fabulous small plate food and an interesting are at if cocktails. service is great. door service a little intimidating,5
great cocktails and the crafty mixologists always  happy to make a custom cocktail.,5
"really fun place. cocktails are a little pricey but not ridiculous and there's a lot of imagination in them. service was friendly and very helpful. not entirely easy to find but if you look for the door staff you'll get there. really nice layout as well, has a cool opium den/speakeasy type of feel.",4
great food great drinks,5
unexpected spot with good cocktails! loved the vibe.,5
this is mine and my friends favourite end of evening haunt. the dim sum on offer is delicious and the drinks are great. if you're looking for somewhere to get plastered this isn't the place for you but if you're looking to have sophisticated classy drinking and eating experience then definitely check out this hidden hole,5
"poorly staffed for amount of people as it was a friday night, food took forever to arrive and if something was unavailable on menu they didnt tell you they just left you waiting ... hungry. would not go there again & would not recommend. very pricey for what you get",1
nice place to chill. great cocktails,5
"the new menu isn't as good, but still one of my favourite cocktail bars. the dim sum is delicious and the cocktails impressive. contender for best date spot in central london!",5
"great drinks, great service, yummy late-night food.",4
delicious cocktails and great ambience in the apothecary bar. i would skip the dim sums though - quite overpriced and you can get the same quality dim sums in one of the many restaurants nearby for half the price.,4
great cocktails. litchi martini is my favorite.,5
"was probably better some years ago, now too cool and too expensive for the atmosphere.",3
"where better to head if you want a drink in china town? there may not be many things to choose from, but i wanted to try all of them. the dim sum, isn't the best you'll find in the area, but it is served late into the night, and with booze - great combo :-) ",4
"favourite hang out for a cocktail in central london, the peony bar is a nice chilled setting with good music",5
great bar(s) with drinks you have never seen beforerecommended if you want something extra than sn ordinary bar night in londonrecommended,5
cocktails overpriced and not that good. the sitting/table space are not comfy. we had a booking but were like cramped in a small corner. staff was very polite and nice though.,3
"awesome dumplings and good bottled craft beer. great atmosphere including low lights, low chairs and tables, and a great 80's music selection. expensive, but totally worth it.",4
lovely place with cool cocktails. loved the decor and the music,5
always worth a opium no 7 ,5
something different. nice atmosphere and interesting coctails. perfect place for tea at late afternoon.,5
amazing cocktails with very nice presentation.,5
like a speak easy bar. you're not sure what to expect until you get there. great cocktails.,3
great cocktails from the bartenders but unfortunately the food/drink runner man was a bit creepy to the ladies in the group and we watched him exhibit the same behavior to other tables.,3
"fantastic dim sum, would recommend the variety platter. fearless cocktail was a nice and sweet take on tequila aswell. don't be discouraged by the three flights of stairs, it's worth it!",5
hidden restaurant with an interesting set up of a former opium den. the bar is great with an interesting choice of cocktails. food was good but quite expensive. wouldn't come here for dim sum only but would come for the hidden den with a small group of friends and enjoy a few drinks at the bar.,5
"nice bar hidden away in china town, doorway can easily be missed. cocktails were interesting, especially the ones based in the chinese animal years. best cocktails were the cherry blossom vesper and the plum champs elyses. service was the only let down as was very slow",4
"cool spot, very underrated from outside. multi levels, cool atmosphere and incredible cocktails. great date night spot!",5
drink: 7/10service: 7/10decor & atmosphere: 8/10service speed: 8/10cost: 5/10the best: friendly service and instaworthy drinksthe worst: place is a bit darklowdown: interesting cocktails which will come at a price. place is great for dates though is a bit dark and squishy for bigger groups.,3
told us to leave for no reason. very unconventional,1
"really dissatisfied with the staff. really rude for no reason. visiting for the weekend from barcelona in which i attended there other club frequently. a friend put us on a guest list, but the hostess said we were too drunk even though we had not even drank before the club. go anywhere else!",1
nice place. good cocktails although a bit pricey,4
"pricy but the best cocktails in london, the place is awesome too with unique style",5
nice atmosphere,4
"such a cool place and the rooms are fun.  surprised us with an anniversary drink for our celebration.  we ordered food and it was great, but we wish the waitress would have told us the kitchen was closing as we wanted to order more food and they had stopped serving.",4
nice food at affordable prices,4
great cocktails in a very cool atmosphere. nice music and friendly staff.,5
"great atmosphere and great cocktails. it's hidden, if you get lost look for the big chap next to the cash point guarding an unmarked door!",5
words cannot describe the amazing experience at this wonderful cocktail bar.stuff was so lovely and friendly. the food and the cocktails are one of the best i had.highly recommend,5
great cocktail bar for a date night,5
this place offers great cocktails!,4
there are loads of places in london which serve much better cocktails for the same price. im not even mentioning an extremely rude service and a waitress who was trying to clean my unfinished meal 3 times in a row,1
+++ the food is really good and the service is friendly--- the bar is a bit cramped and they ran out of all deserts (strange as most people book),4
cool cocktails and great service ,5
mysterious entrance with a nice little setup. great for a small group of people or a date. the dumplings are great and the year themed drinks even better!,5
"big dish for dim sum and a casual place to chat, but to be honest the quality is so so not so high.",4
brilliant bar with great dim sum. was pleasantly surprised to find them serving food well past midnight and really good dim sum at that. the cocktails are a little expensive but they are good.,5
"awesome cocktails and delicious dumplings! be there early if you don't want to wait, they have a list.",5
"excellent food and drinks, a bit pricey, but staff are attentive and willing to chat too. they extended our booking on chinese new year which was very nice given the queues and tight schedules",5
"great cocktails, super friendly staff and a great atmosphere! the bartenders were very attentive and put lots of time and effort into every one their cocktails despite it being a busy night! can't wait to go back and try some more cocktails and the dim sum! ",5
nice & easy dim sum - cool cocktails. tables are really close together and difficult to hear each other but a cool atmosphere. try & book if u can,5
"hidden place in chinatown, you must know it. amazing cocktails, cozy atmosphere, nice furniture and decor. i really loved it.",5
one of my favourite speakeasy bars in london. the bar is spread over two floors with 4/5 rooms with different chinese themes. do be aware that the cocktail menu is different (and more limited) in some of the rooms. cocktail prices are in line with soho bars. highly recommended ,5
love the atmosphere and the cocktails here. staff is super nice and they would always find us a table even without reservation,5
lovely little secret cocktail bar. they were happy to make a cocktail which was no longer on menu. staff attentive without being overbearing. a must visit place.,5
great hidden speak easy type bar with dim lighting,5
i like this discreet bar. the service was friendly and the cocktails topnotch. good date night destination.,5
"quite pretentious, too many rules (sitting rule, limited time reservation) for a place where you are supposed to go and have fun. this place is only good for guys that are trying to go to places to fill their checklist. totally not recommended",1
the waiting to get in was well worth it! the staff was very busy but gave us all the attention needed guiding us in the menu. the drinks was superb and well worth the money! in my opinion a must go if in soho or near.,5
great and private place. wonderful drinks. andrea and jerome were the best barmen ever.,5
wonderful speakeasy-style cocktail bar in chinatown. barkeeps know their business. great old school atmosphere/ambiance. perfect place to take a date.,5
nice cocktails.,4
the cocktail we're almost undrinkable and  its decor was old not retro like going to your grannies house with bad drinks..... we couldn't get out of there fast enough,1
"amazing food, service and drinks.",5
"in love with this place. nice cocktails, beautiful atmosphere and music and super cozy. had a lovely time!",5
"best dim sum in london, amazing cocktails! the best one ive tried is the rat  which uses dry ice",5
not a bad bar. but for a quite bar like this to have a gate keeper who had to call upstairs to ask if he can let 5 people in when we were well within the closing time is a joke!  there was lots of availabity of seats when we went up. drinks and atmosphere were great... just don't act like an elitist bar when you are not!,3
"very nice cocktails. dim sum could be better, but still tasty! peony is a great little intimate room. good music playlists as well. @alexszaborl",5
good atmosphere but normal drinks,4
"brilliant bar. really friendly staff, cocktail list was superb (try their ox or rabbit cocktails) and pork buns that you never want to end. all in all a fun and memorable experience",5
loved it. great fun with friends,5
"nice staff, tasty and unusual cocktails and good dumplings",4
nice cocktails and the decoration is amazing,5
very crowded during the weekends but a fascinating place during the weekdays. stunning cocktail list.,4
"love love love this place, it's not just a place to go for drinks, its art.",5
"service was splendid. great for a night out with friends. great laughs, great drinks and a great atmosphere make for a great time!",4
"the cocktail is very nice, but the environment could be better",4
"even though i walked around the building twice to find the little door and its sign giving away it's location, the theme of the bar was somewhat fitting for it being in chinatown. friendly bartender and creative drinks... and dim sum!",5
"such a cool speakeasy style cocktail bar with dim sum. the cocktails were delicious and imaginative, uses many ingredients and spirits that are unique. the dim sum was tasty. the space is small but perfect for the vibe. maximum booking time is for two hours.",4
"very great looking place, staff very nice, however the cocktails were too sweet, lacking of elegance and subtle taste,  and dim sum were not holding together and rather blend. price is not coherent compared to the quality delivered. would not come back.",2
"had a fabulous night with friends, drinking devils doctor. what a wonderful cocktail. we also had seafood dim sum, it was delicious. the staff were attentive and very nice. will definitely be returning.",5
a bit strange. great music but a bit expensive.,3
a great chinese speakeasy with a nice but simply executed theme. they have signature drinks based on the zodiac but i found the signature cocktails more interesting,5
well hidden dim sum and cocktail bar in china town. options for dim sum was limited but they were excellent.,5
these were good cocktails! the ones based on the chinese calendar are cool because they come in funny tiger or goat glasses. sounds corny but actually quite a nice touch bizarrely. the standard martinis are also delicious,5
great late night upscale option in chinatown. amazing dumplings and great cocktails.,5
"drinks are quite pricey, but the decor is nice and music is good!",4
"one of a kind interior, great  music playlist. great stuff and location in london city center. music and whole atmosphere in club was perfect. i went there few times already and every time it keeps getting better and better.",5
the drinks are the real stars of the show though and will keep you there late into the night. you will not regret coming here.,4
"we were expecting better dumplings and more cocktail varieties, the building and staff were really nice. the door guy was great",3
an excellent cocktail bar. i like the decor and menu,5
"very cool place, very cool people",5
interesting cocktailsfantastic dim sum,5
"amazing atmosphere and incredible cocktails, i felt like i had been transported to a chinese opium den in the heart of london.",5
"if you love dim sum and cocktails this is the place for you, the funk and the decor, the vibe and the service, its worth a visit.",4
"hidden away upstairs in middle of china town, lovely little cocktail bar with interesting selection of cocktails",4
"the place is really nice, cocktails are superb and the staff is good.the only warning is that you need to wait between 10/20 minutes to get in because is always busy. but it's worth it!",5
"got there after midnight on a saturday and got a space for 2 on the top floor at the bar. the barmen are great and it's fun to watch them making the cocktails. it's kinda expensive, but the venue and the original drinks are worth it. great place for a date",4
"it's a must visit in chinatown. drinks, atmosphere spot on. the staff fitted us in without a booking on nye, run through the menu with us, didn't over sell, very professional bunch.",5
great drinks helpful waiters and really good dim-sum,4
"so many good bars in london, but this one just about takes the cake. great staff, great bouncers, good selection of drinks, a very welcoming atmosphere and some very tasty snacks!",5
excellent cocktails albeit very small and expensive,2
excellent spicy dumplings.,5
very lovely place. the cocktails are excellent and the char siu bau is a must try! love the atmosphere and the fact that it's not as loud as most cocktail bars - you can actually have a conversation without having to shout!,5
"hidden away in the upstairs of the building, opium has various different sub-rooms for cozy drinks with small groups of people. the dim sum was a great snack",5
popped along with the other half and did not know we were going. liked it had a nice beer and a few cocktails. reminded me of sherlock holmes in his opium den. dark and cosy good for a few drinks. they did sell food but did not try but looked nice.,4
"can't explain how good it was to be there for a very late night cocktails date. everything they offer is amazing, cool vibe i rarely found in other former opium parlours... worth more than a visit!",5
the bouncers were really aggressive,1
"interesting place, interesting drinks, interesting layout...",4
"fun, great dimsums n drinks. the atmosphere can be better!",4
love this place! great dim sums of course..& excellent cocktails! highly recommended! reservation might be necessary if you are going during the weekend!,5
quite rare to meet such a rude and super aggressive doorman -really disappointed as i was planning to taste your cocktails with some friends.,1
"very nice hidden bar with a superb atmosphere. staff is friendly, music is really chill. they played the playlist from guardians of the galaxy vol.1, which was really nice. the biggest downside is that you pay 13-15 for a cocktail that barely contains any alcohol. you just don't taste it at all...",3
"loved it. from the welcome by the doorman to the great service and devine cocktails. the only problem is choosing what to have but the waiters are really skilled in helping you find what suits. bookings only, so plan ahead!",5
"original place, great for a date",5
"loved the cocktails and dim sum here! the drinks were priced on par for london, but they were so delicious and creative! loved our night out here!",5
"great food, classy restaurant, and the most attentive service i've ever experienced in an eatery. the staff was very kind to help a yank order off a chinese menu more sophisticated than i am used to. perfect stop in chinatown, just a few feet from leicester square and piccadilly circus.",5
lovely food we had set meal for two with drinks and tips fifty pounds.,5
great place with amazing food.waiter suggest an alternative to what we ordered because the table wanted to share four different dishes and two of them were very similar.and it was a mouth watering experience and hands down the best dish on the table that evening.,5
good food and great price! great location in the heart of china town! i loved the crispy noodles and the spice aubergine! i would definitely go back.,5
the best chinese food.,5
really good food and very good service would definitely recommend it,5
"fantastic food.  we've been at many restaurants in china town, and we visited at mid afternoon saturday for dim sum and bbq.  easily some of the best in china town.  good service as well.",5
foods are excellent,5
"possibly my favourite chinese in london. always delicious, and friendly service. great dim sum.",5
nice food and staff!,4
"in general the food is good, the portions generous, but some of the dishes from the set menu that we have chosen were a bit blunt. it's better to choose single dishes from the normal menu. the food that our friends ordered was richer in taste",3
3bb,1
"big up kenny, love this place ! excellent food and great service.",5
superb dim sum and hot and sour soup.,5
real chinese food,5
food was out of the world,5
rip off,2
a decent dim sum menu not filled with the usual china town items. usual spot of a quick casual dim sum sunday meet up.,4
great food & atmospherewould recommend the steamed custard buns !,5
"one of the worst meals i can remember... got wrong items and manager did nothing about it. food came all at different times and some people had finished before others got theirs, which for a table of 4 is awful.... they actually added a 10% tip to the bill!!",1
nice place 4a lunch,4
food was amazing. had a really good time here. staff was also super friendly. would definitely recommend it.p.s if you thought this review or the images were helpful then please do like it to show your support :),4
"was hoping for a great experience, but experienced rude and impatient staff, low quality food",1
"very pleasant,efficient staff,food was good,what more could you want!",5
best dimsum!,5
very expensive wine,3
best dim sum i've had recently.  nicely styled restaurant and not too pricey.  can't wait to go again,5
"deep fried fest, nice staff but not so good food",2
dimsum is okay - genuine cantonese and queueing never takes longer than 15 minutes,4
chili garlic fried crab hands down is the best i have had so far!,5
we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table but it was worth it. their dim-sum are absolutely amazing and the service was very fast. would definitely come back ,4
i really enjoyed the dim sum there. the restaurant has really nice modern decor. the staff were friendly. i would definitely go back and i recommend this restaurant.,5
really good food and great value,4
"loved it. the staff was lovely, very nice and welcoming. nice food too i love their presentation. it's beautiful, worth checking out",5
great food and efficient service. been three times already and always very happy.,5
"looks like this place is great for dimsum. for the aubergine in black bean sauce, not so much. really oily. my mum had the lemon chicken which she thought was delicious.",3
seriously overpriced for the quantity and quality of our food! everything seems to be microwaved and i dont actually think they cook anything to order! i would recommend avoiding this place and spend your money elsewhere!,1
the food was awesome! however a little bit more flair from the staff would have earned it a five star.,4
"super tasty, fast service. the tea was great and the wait time was low. i'd actually recommend the chicken claws, especially the cold ones. the dimsum menu was large, though the menu and ordering system was mainly in mandarin. so, you'll have to use the pictures and numbers if you go!",4
"perfect location, various menu, very friendly staff and ambiance. foods are delicious and prices are reasonable.  good for the couple at families even with kids..",5
nice place in heart of china town. reasonable prices for central london. good food.,5

an old haunt of ours now updated. food is still some if the best in china town,4
excellent dim sum. good selection. reasonable prices.assume the service will be bad and the queues long and you can only be pleasantly surprised.,5
just renovated restaurant. skilled chinese cooking with considerate england service. duck is a must try dish even if you are from china.,5
yummy yummy and more yummy. food was amazing. came out hot and fresh with minimal wait time. i suggest getting a reservation because i dont think you can get in here for dinner without one. the dimsum was to die for and the teriyaki beef was soooo tender it was almost unbelievable. so glad i came here.,5
"great location, efficient service, not inordinately expensive and quite a comprehensive menu. we were happy to see that vegetarians were also well catered for and had a large variety of dishes to choose from. decent sized portions.",4

"decent soho chinese fare. gets the job done, which is a compliment in these darkly mediocre times.",4
good food for a very reasonable price in china town. restaurant is very cramped and could do with some updated furniture and general decoration.,4
"very good service, they made tweaks to the dishes to allow for vegetarian; food was delicious, especially the grilled eggplant!",4
delicious chinese food. a rather new restaurant in chinatown but the dim sum is amazing. the menu however is all in chinese but i'm not sure if they also have an english version.,5
possibly the best value for money in chinatown. excellent menu and useful wine list. check your bill and the machine totals before paying.,3
"pleasantly surprised. for something right in the middle of chinatown it's good tasting, decent service and really good menu. two of us paid about 35 pounds and left food over. it's surprising that it wasn't so busy at late lunch time.",5
good value for money. not the most amazing dim sum but great for the price and def satisfactory. service is always a bit dismissive but i still go back.,4

stopped for a quick snack pre theatre. service was very fast. food was tasty.,4
great chinese food. very friendly staff for a chinese restaurant..........,4

"on the food side i want to give orient london five star, but i really suggest they should change the reservation person cause he literally does not understand english and have any patient at all when i make reservation.",3
good food but expensive for the area,4
reliable chinese food,4
"food was average compared to my last visit. was slightly disappointed by the food, but service was excellent",3
"premium asian restaurant with very good prices. staff very polite and professional, food is superbe",5
the service was prompt but the waiting staff did not tell us that they would be charging tea per cup instead of the pot. it was a rude shock to have to pay more for the tea. i loved the dim sum as it was to perfection.,3
good and excellent service. not the best sushi i had.,3

this restaurant was unexpectedly good. the service is excellent and the presentation is really nice!,5
"great service and fabulous food. we arrived earlier than expected and they were having to turn people away who hadn't booked but they seated us immediately and looked after us really well.  obviously there is a lot of choice in chinatown, but this is a winner.",5
dim sum is superb,5
tasty dim sum at good price. also not to be missed is one of the scrumptious authentic cantonese dinner set menus best for party of 2 as you can have a taste of multiple dishes of good portion. service is just good enough.,5

great food. good service,4
incredible food - the asparagus starter is the best starter i've ever had at a chinese restaurant. service can be a bit hit and miss but the food makes it more than worth it,4
very good service and lovely choice of food.,5
"nice chinese,  lovely soft shell crab but portions are on the smaller side and prices on the higher end compared to some other restaurants in the area.  nice decor and not dodgy like some china town restaurants can be.  lovely and friendly staff ",5
very nice good. excellent service,5
always high standard and clean,5
very good dim sum served here at affordable rates. it's much bigger inside than it looks outside. they have a har gao with truffles which is quite interesting. best to come in groups of 3 because a lot of dishes have 3 servings.,5
delicious yum cha,5
great choice  always a feast not only for your tastebuds but also your eyes.  more help for different combinations from the staff would be appreciated.,4

great chinese food,4
"horrible experience. i reserved a table for 9pm for birthday celebration with my sister visiting london but when i reached, they refused to acknowledge the reservation, despite showing them the call log on my phone. avoid to embarrass yourself when you reach there!!!!",1
mediocre undistinguished chinese food in an unmemorable atmosphere - but delivered via attentive and friendly service,2
big portion size. taste average.,4
one of the best restaurants in chinatown. good food and good price. i have been a regular for years. the restaurant has been renovated in recent years and the quality of food hasn't gone away.,4
"the venue is nice but jade gardens dim sums (the previous restaurant) used to be soooo much better - if jade garden was a 10/10, this new place is a 3/10",2
"good place for dim sum, i go regularly, it seems authentic and reasonably priced",4
not amazing but far from bad. classic chinese dishes done well at extremely reasonable prices,4
"my fav place in chinatown. nice decor, nice atmosphere, great dim sum.",5
fast service and delicious,5
"pretty tasty food and decent service. probably a little pricier than i would like, but i guess that's what you get for being on the edge of leicester square.",4
great food. fast service. not cheap but worth a trip. lovely staff,5
"we had dimsum here and my friend who is chinese recommended this place as it can be ""close"" to authentic. we enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. the food is reasonably priced and you can benefit from very prompt service and refills of tea.",5
pretty authentic food and fast food. staff could be friendlier but overall still pretty good,4
"good service and food quality. though table seatings are a bit close, the waiters can quickly attend to your requests. quality of the chinese tea, dim sums and dishes i tried is very good.  real chinese style with very little compromise to western taste.",4
had set menu with friends which was had very generous portions and was and great tasting. sad to have missed out on dim sum though. maybe next time...,5
im from hong kong and this was the first place ive tried in london that was as good as the stuff back home. the dim sum is all really nice. have been so many times now and will keep going there when im feeling homesick.,5
their dim sum are really good,5
"came from edinburgh expecting good dim sum, but the food was below average, particularly the char siu.",2
"food was fantastic, the staff were very nice and it didn't hurt your pocket.",5
so disappointed with the taste of the food. there was barely any spice or seasoning in the chilli chicken schezhuan and the rest of the food tasted pretty bland too.,2
"its delicious, clean and fast  and good service",4
we ordered about 8 different things to try as much as we can and it was all too sweet and rather dull. didn't enjoy it .,2
"rude service.couldn't be bothered to stay to be ignored any longer,so can't  rate the food.went there for a birthday evening meal .all staff seemed to be stressed ,so wasn't a good start. anyway, i'm done  with chinese restaurants. usually,either rude or happy to take customers for granted or poor quality food",1
"a very good classic chinese restaurant. all the great classic chinese dishes and then some. took us a while to get through the menu and make a choice, and everything was tasty and we'll prepared. there are really no surprises here. nothing exquisite, but no disappointments. just good old chinese food.",5
"great food, great service and very very polite people...suggested place to visit.",5
the seasonal vegetables is basically a bunch of boiled spinach. not much for 19 quid! and duck was not so great.,1
"food and service excellent, we had seaweed, dumpling platter 8, veg spring rolls, chill squid with ginger and scallions, chrispy tofu in black bean served with fried rice.. very high quality food and very fast service. will be back!",5
"fantastic as always, really enjoyed the food and the service was good. ordered way too much so we had leftovers, but will definitely be back for more",5
"fantastic dim sum and plates. the crispy pineapple rolls were the perfect post-dinner treat: sweet, but not overly so. attentive staff was patient with my 4 year old and helped us to pick a dish she'd love.",5
"good food, fast service from respectful staff. the best of all is the atmosphere the restaurant creates. truly astounding for a night out.",5
the decor and set up of this place is really nice. we were served really quickly and the food came out quickly- a little too quickly which made me think that it wasn't really made fresh. i think there are better places to eat in chinatown.,3
huge portions and delicious food! service was great,5
used to be jade garden london. change to orient london now but dinsum are still good especially noodle with king prawn,5
"good food, nice and helpful staff.",5
dimsum ok. cheung fen too thick. excellent siumai. average overall.,4
basic food. bad service. not worth it at all!,2

"not good chinese at all. if this is the best london has to offer, then we're in trouble.  rude service... poor quality beef. they rush you out. go find something better, don't waste your money here.",1
the food was just bland. i would recommend  staying away from the set menu.,2

"had a group dinner here, perfect for a 10 person group, the price is reasonable and the food and environmentand the staff is really worth it. it gets really busy at dinner time, so best make a reservation. peking duck and roast duck are very good.",5

amazing and crispy pequim duck! my favourite place to have this dish. the rest of the food is also good. you can have menus where you will eat a lot for 20.50/24 depending on your option.,5
food was good. hard to find good chinese food especially in china town where theres so much restaurants available. just make sure you read the menu properly and also the set menus. would visit again,4

delicious food in chinatown! would definitely go back.,5
"decent chinese food, appalling service",1
on a google search for gluten free chinese food this came top. unfortunately they could only do steamed fish as all their meat and seafood dishes are prepared in advance and had been coated in flour. perhaps they can cope if advance notice is given  we paid for our drinks and left.,1
"amazing dim sum, i especially love the salted egg yolk buns which you dont usually find in many other dim sum places",5
"quality service and great food. set menus are very good value for money. i've had a few chinese visitors and they've enjoyed it too! waitresses are very polite, nothing like some of the rude chinese restaurants around soho. recommended.",5

great food and very friendly staff. we're did over team christmas get together here. well recommended !,5
nice and cozy place. food was very good. the person who served us was very friendly and pleasant,5
very good service. food tasted fresh and well cooked.coming back soon.,5
average cantonese food and value. in general the food is good and the service is quite fast. a descent choice if you are looking for cantonese in london chinatown.,3
"wonderful food, excellent service, the staff had no issue when we asked for some time between courses. definitely worth a visit.",5
"service was awful, the waiter was pushing really hard for tips, barely had any service from him and we end up paying tips forcefully. to be fair, some food was not bad, the soup was however bland and the char siu was dreadful, everything is disappointed, will remember this place as im never coming back again",1
great atmosphere and the food was great. polite staff. could have slightly dimmed the lights in the evening. busy on saturday and food came out really at a good pace and no long waits.,4
"great decor and affordable prices, but the dim sum was a bit greasy.",4
it wasn't really my style. it's very grunge,3
"originally over charged me,  i argued him down as girls dresses he's selling is available for 4 pounds off ebay and cheaper off ali express. he agreed to lower the price and then hid the price while i put in my card meaning i paid the full whack. really dishonest.",1
very good service and got couple off dress's and other stuff for my friends parents for chinese new year,5
nice,3
good collection,5
"to my surprise, there is a korean and japanese cosmetics shop in london! what a surprise! i can buy a lot of things i want from here! and the sales staff are very lovely. highly recommended!!",5
"be warned: this shop is very expensive but if you really love japanese products and japan in general (like i do), then you will love shopping here!! staff members are nice, they always let me browse without pushing me to buy anything. best regards. luana.",5
amazing skin care products a bit pricey,4
"been here many times over the last few years, and every time ended up paying twice the amount compared with amazon/official website..... i kept trying new brands but tbh after 3out of 5 times being ripped off i am never going to this place again........",1
way too overpriced. you can get all of their items online for 50-75% cheaper.,1
not the cheapest but best k beauty in london,5
"a bit overpriced, but it's okay",3
"i've never heard of this place, and while asking for a review, google won't let me see where it is.",3
didn't go there,1
found my face masks i was searching for on the net. the ladies try very hard to speak and serve in english very nice girls,4
cheaper order online. too overpriced.,3
all asian skincare brands you could dream of. cute staff. basically heaven. bring your entire paycheck because this place is expensive.,5
"terrible customer service, made to feel very uncomfortable,  no one asked if i needed help! would have spent money, but left.......",1
i don't know. i haven't been on it. so i can't help you with that.,3
love it,4
lovely products.  lovely staff,5
everyone was very nice and provide excellent service with high quality products. the previous reviews don't do it service.,5
good,4
really expensive. box of sheet masks that was about 9 in a beauty store in hong kong was almost 50 in the shop. seriously?,1
"i thought it was awesome cos there are so many korean/japanese skincare products, but they priced one mask at 8.00 and an eyelash curler at fricking 24 lol. idk about import prices but this definitely exceeds import prices. stuff like this would cost way less in that country, i'm pretty sure they multiply each price by 8 :/",1
absolutely awful experience. super high price markups and very poor service. the staff used lame argument when dealing with me the customer.  i personally wouldn't shop in such a place any more.,1
unreasonable high price and great range of selection,2
extremely expensive... buy online.,1
"quite pricey,products in the shop is excellence, but service in there is so poorly like below zero!you don't get much help or even recommendations.staff seem so unfriendly and uninvited.",1
nice!,4
"lot's of product range, lady at store was very helpful and nice.",5
very very expensive compared to online. not organiswd well howevrr has lots of products. the sales people were on there phones and were not helpful would not recommend thisover sjopping online,2
incredibly overpriced and the staff was not very helpful.,1
too expensive.,2
prices are jacked up but the staff was really helpful and rather friendly. ,4
what is this,5
too expensive,1
"grande variedade em produtos coreanos. a loja  pequena, mas muito encantadora. pesquisei muito aqui no brasil antes de viajar para londres.  foi muito melhor do que eu imaginei.  um universo de k-beauty no centro da cidade ",5
"bun burgers were soaking wet and cold due to the piled high salad that was saturated with water. atmosphere was non-existent, dance music pumping and the place wasnt sparkling clean. a sad dinner of a bank holiday monday.",1
food was ok really disappointed by the very small calamari dish they had on there lunch menu which cost and extra two pounds...the bao bun was very taste but again for the price wasn't filling.i would say my colleague ordered better so will probably come again.,4
amazing food on shaftsbury avenue. the bo sat vang pho is next level. a must try are the fresh summer rolls with tiger prawns. will definitely return at some point in the future.,5
"delicious dishes, especially the bun hue with authentic vietnamese taste. service is rather bad as the restaurant is crowded most of the time, we once had to wait 20 minutes for the menu to be brought out.recommended if youre not in a rush for a quick service",4
"truly splendid pho, the stock is delicious. portions are generous, stick to just one starter so you can fully enjoy your pho. if you're having a bao burger you might be okay ordering more!",5
"nice small vietnamese.the food was good and fresh, our pho needed some more salt.the stuff was friendly and the 2 course meal makes a very good value for money.",4
"good food, place is a little tiny and customer service was not too great",4
really great atmosphere and food and the staff are incredibly friendly. we had the special platter for starter and pork belly bao burgers and the grilled bananas for dessert and a few cocktails and couldn't fault any of it. definitely would recommend!,5
"fantastic steamed bao burgers, can highly recommend!",5
enjoyed our meal. good value. good service.,5
left a bit underwhelmed and still hungry. ordered the bun burger which sounds great on paper but is missing something considering the price 8-10 for a burger. maybe if i got pho it would be a different story but its unlikely i'll come back to try it.,2
delicious food and great service. local small and loud when is crowded. they serve take away as well. better go with reservation. highly recommended!!!,5
delicious and freshly made good.,5
"absolutely delicious pho!! the best chicken pho ive had in london. spring rolls are great here too - very crispy and fresh. the lunch deal cant be beat either. my only complaint is the vegetarian bun, while tasty, is pretty small.",4
"a chain of vietnamese restaurants. pretty authentic. although, of courses, to be properly authentic you'd be sat on a road side in a tiny plastic chair eating food freshly served to you from a massive bowl of pho. other than that, pretty authentic taste.",3
delicious food.  cosy place.  great friendly service,5
great groupon deal.. 9 dishes and a drink for each one for 40! good was great and fast service. highly recommended!,5
brilliant food and service,5
delicious ramen. try also their special burger. you wont regret it. but the best part is the waitress wh served us. she was amazing.,5
went on a groupon offer of five courses and a glass of prosecco. did not disappoint! fresh tasty food and great pho. recommend booking though as gets very busy,5
food was good but not amazing however the prices suited. the atmosphere and decor was pretty nice.,4
"reasonably good value as a tenner for lunch special, friendly and efficient service. unfortunate the pho didn't have much flavour to it, so i won't be back. maybe if they served it with birds eye chili's, fish sauce and lime instead of lemon?",3
delicious traditional pho at a very good price,5
one of the best burger experiences ive ever had,5
"super delicious, light yet flavorful pho, crunchy summer rolls, friendly and efficient staff.the midweek lunch deal is a steal.worth a visit if you're in the area.",5
"a little gem in the west end. great quality food, with portions large enough to share at a reasonable price",4
nice food and service. set lunch meal 9.95 for an appetizer and main is the best value lunch during my short trip in london,4
"i wanted to try this dish and it was amazing. we came here because the food looked delicious, we werent disappointed! its a quaint place where you wait to get into the restaurant. its that busy of a place which means its good.",5
the food was excellent! it was so busy however pedro looked after us and made us feel really special on my wife's birthday so thank you.,5
the most amazing vietnamese food i ever had. highly recommended. fast service and friendly staff.,5
"really good food, fast service. great value for money. very impressed.",5
the food here is delicious but its a little tight in space. a woman at the table next to me knocked her glass of water and i ended up with a soaking wet leg. staff could also be a little more attentive - it was difficult to get another drink and ask for the bill. 10/10 for food though,4
"great place. exceptional pho bo, great service, highly recommended! would definitely come here again.",5
"best vietnamese food i've ever had. nice atmosphere, friendly staff and amazing food! great value for money. would definitely go again",5
"the service was good. the fried squid is quite crispy. pho with beef was very tasty. the fried rice is much beyond perfect. the sausages, tiger prawns, paprikas in it just hittrd the sweet point of my tongue. i'll recommend it to everyone who want to try vietnam food in london.",5
amazing food! we visited for dinner and had to queue for 10 or so minutes but boy was it worth it. every dish was delicious and service was fast and friendly. will be returning.,5
"super small restaurant with tiny tables which may feel a bit cramped at times. food is better than i expected, not too greasy. unfortunately no pho that i can eat but the bowls looks really tasty. decent pricing for dishes. service is a little hit and miss so dont expect the full works. overall pretty good, would visit again",3
"wow - best pho we ever had.highly recommended.nice atmosphere friendly staff and great food.we also had the honey pork bun which was incredible. light and tasty at the same time.we will come here again and again and again, thank you.came here a second time. wow consistently perfect - you have to try this out.",5
"order 3 starters, pork ribs, pork belly bun and spring roll. very very good but a little bit pricey.had pho soup, best soup so far i have tasted in london.will i go again, yes i will. worth the money.table is too small and limited seats in the shop, small  restaurant.",4
"lovely food and service. as most places, can get very cramped and right up against a stranger's shoulder and conversation. not the best place to discuss secret plots. perhaps good for giving bad news to someone so they don't make a scene? either way, if you want good vietnamese food next to the theatres, this is a great choice.",4
"food was very average. i had the lemongrass tofu burger. the tofu is tasteless and does not really go well with the salad. the sweet potatoe fries were good. music was loud, waiter was nice",3
"tried the 6 course tasting menu, and an extra bun-burger and sweet potato chips to share for two. excellent.",5
"lovely food, best to book if you want yo visit this place as quiet popular. always love vietnamese food must try my favourite is pho noodles xin ciaooooo",4
good food but uncomfortable seating,4
"good authentic food, that was fresh and not greasy at all. they do a good set menu, 3 courses and a drink for 23 and day any time thats good value",5
cute little spot with perfectly done food and gorgeous cocktails. must book to avoid disappointment. a little gem.,5
"pho was amazing, the squid fry was the besy. the summer spring rolls were ok. portions are fairly large. do try the squid fry. yum yum",5
"i never expected to find such amazing food right on shaftesbury avenue. blown away by the quality of the chilli squid and bbq pork pho bun especially,  definitely going back",5
it was very busy the service was good the food was nice i recommend to anybody,1
"went for pre theatre meal. service friendly and  very good. order came quickly. food was excellent. some great cocktrails too. popular place, so always a good sign. would recommend.",5
"please go pho soho but not this one. services there is much better than this one. waiting for 10 mins to order in a peak time, although there were 3 servers working. waving my hand for 5 times still no one care about me. a guy saw me and still chatting to others. just keep these useless staffs lol.",1
"cosy place and good food! the three dishes in the pictures, plus one coke and a beer costed 38.",4
"tables are pretty small, but i cannot fault the food in any way. the pho is amazing. my family and i returned 4 times on a week long holiday and i will definitely go back if i'm in london again.",5
great food lovely flavours not massively expensive. quite full all the time we were there. could do with aircon as was very hot inside.,4
delicious. prompt and delightful service. amazing food. five stars,5
nice and compact vietnamese restaurant. it has slightly lost its authenticity but still a nice place with tasty food. staff are friendly and the beer cold.,4
good food and relatively cheap. we came in right as they were closing up but they served us anyway. get the fried doughstick!,5
delicious food and good service.,4
very tasty noodles and spring/summer rolls. i am also quite allergic to nuts which can be an issue but the menu was very clearly marked and the staff made me feel safe in my choices.,4
"good pho restaurant in china town, london. they have a set lunch menu for under 10, or a menu with four courses for 15.99.i went for pho with tender beef and a pork bao, with pan fried prawn cake to start.for desert i had the pandan and coconut panacotta and the coconut snow ice coffee.",4
"lovely  food . normally busy so need to book, worth noting do theatre menus and offers with time out .  gets warm inside often though",5
loved the freshness of the ingredients and the service was fast!,4
"excellent food, lovely service. pho was the real deal. had to wait a bit even with a reservation but totally worth it !",5
"if you are looking for an authentic vietnamese restaurant this is not the place to go, we loved the vibe and the interior design",1
average place. no vegan pho although the menu doesn't specify it. the bao was really not impressive. curry was ok,2
"rustic looking vietnamese decor but all tables very close together and feels claustrophobic. service was friendly but felt rushed. the starters were fairly good, but i wasn't impressed with the beef pho. altogether not a bad place but nothing special.",3
tasty tasty! mains and starters were fantastic,5
great cozy little place for lunch . service was fast and friendly and the pho was sublime .deffo up there with the best pho iv had before .,5
we found this little place by chance last night. we loved it! and i've still been thinking about the burger today. can't wait for my next visit. great food friendly staff and affordable ,5
lovely food and helpful staff.,5
sweet and cosy vietnamese eatery on shaftesbury avenue. the food is really tasty and well presented - and it arrived swiftly. interior is rustic. staff are helpful and obliging. well worth a visit.,4
excellent. order from the theater menu for good value,5
friendly staff and very tasty food. good quality/price lunch menu.,5
i dont think waiting for a bun for over 20 minutes is reasonable,3
nice vietnamese restaurant serving decent pho and good spring rolls,4
"tried a few vietnamese restaurants on a trip to london, and this place was by far the best one. both bun bo hue and and bun thit nuong was really tasty. the interior of the restaurant is nice and service was good.",4
"amazing food , great service",5
friendly stuff and really tasty vietnamese food. i tried vietnamese food for the first time and waiter helped me with my order. price is also good. only disadvantage is the space. not that much inside.,5
"very good pho, taste is quite authentic and quite a good selection on the menu. price is also reasonable.",4
"so far, it is the best vietnamese food that i tried in london. try the pho and the bbq pork. the soup was done in 24 hours. the taste is so great ..",5
"nice to try, bought as a present on groupon for me, great service but over priced in my opinion.",4
service is bad,1
"ordered a bao bun as a delivery, and was extremely disappointed. the bun was so unloved, i removed the contents and replaced with odd bits i had at home. poor experience",2
i enjoyed the starters over the main. i feel like the presentation was more important in their dishes over taste and portion. great atmosphere but the food isn't amazing.,2
top!,4
amazing food.  in fact we enjoyed it so much we went before a show then after the show for 2nds and dessert. coconut snow. honey roasted pork buns. yum. ,4
good food and friendly staff,5
the food here is amazing. best flavours i have tasted since vietnam. great atmosphere and the staff are very friendly and efficient. fanny,5
"i really liked the food, the staff we're friendly and fast. i would 100% eat here again. the pho was excellent, as were their burgers.",5
"taste: 3.5 because it's not quite authentic, need to work on the texture. decor & staff: 5 very nice concept.",4
good tasty food with decent portion sizes. they seemed to be having slight issues with the timing of he food but the staff were very apologetic and helpful. definitely worth a visit.,4
for me as a pho-lover is this restaurant one the best places i've ever been in london in looking for how does this vietnamese soup tastes. pho was so delicious with loads of fresh ingredients. i could feel more comfortable if tables were bit bigger.,4
"i had avoided this place, maybe because its hard to find a good vietnamese restaurant, but the bun cha there brought me back to hanoi",5
the staff were friendly and attentive. the prawn pancake was amazing and the pho was fantastic. definitely one of the best vietnamese restaurants in london.,5
one of the best vietnamese cuisine in london!!,5
when you get a set menu the starters are small but they do taste good. mains are very tasty . i may come back for the 3rd time soon. service is not great if that was quality then maybe they could reach 5 star,4
"the pho  is the star of the show, cooked over 24 hours.",5
really good meal with our kids. surroundings a bit cramped but that is reflected in the price. food excellent.,5
"delicious food, reasonably priced and the service was great too.",5
lovely food quick service,5
amazing staff!!! very helpful and very clean,5
"good food, reasonably priced but too many tables crammed together for comfort on street level. probably better downstairs.",4
the pho broth wasn't as complex as i expected it should be,3
"i had the crispy tofu pho and for about 11 a pop, this is a good stumble upon place for the next time you're in central london and need a quick bite! generous servings and well done broth, we left feeling pretty satisfied. the desserts look like they're a winner too - somethings to try next time perhaps. ",4
"pleasant food and customer service. although the place is quite small and had to wait a bit, it was a good overall experience. perfect for anyone who wants quick but good food!",4
best pho you will ever have ,5
inexpensive pho restaurant. spring rolls were amazing!,4
really nice food. good atmosphere. great selection. courteous staff. friendly vibe.,5
"nice place, good food, friendly staff",4
"will be back again, and again, and again.",5
food was lovely but the table service was not so good. shame because we both really enjoyed the food.,3
"delicious and well priced. the tofu bao burger was a little bland, but oh my lorrrrd, the vermicelli with crispy tofu and the spring rolls were divine. i only wish they offered vegetarian-friendly pho (currently you can only have it with a meat-based stock). will be back!",4
delicious veggie pho and great value lunch menu,5
nice viet food. papaya salad and steamed burger from the lunch menu were excellent. some might find it small but i think its good size.,4
pho-ood was absolutely lovely. delicious pork belly and sticky rice,5
"great little hidden gem, great service and also fast. vegetarian options also great",5
"the best vietnamese restaurant in london. great service, fresh ingredients and amazing cocktails.highly recommended.",5
"great traditional viet, nice location and nice staff.",4
one of the best tasting beef pho i've ever had. noodles and the broth were on point. however this restaurant isn't for the hungry or big eaters. portions are quite small but super delicious,5
finally went to see what the fuss was about with this place. good food and good atmosphere so we weren't disappointed at all! would certainly go back. it is worth looking on some table booking websites as you can get set menus that aren't advertised through the pho & bun website where you get better value for money!,4
"nice food and place, portions a little too small",4
"vietnamese restaurant serving pho, buns and fried dishes in an authentic style. tastes are fresh, prices reasonable, service a little patchy, but definitely worth a try!",4
excellent food and service. great value.,5
staff were friendly enough but some of the food was fairly standard. pricey for quality,3
"love it, great food and service",5
the food ace delicious the right amounti had so much fun they became my personal dj voluntary playing music and free deserts to make my birthday extra special (they knew it was my birthday last minute) yet still out of good will they celebrated with me. thank you staff you are awesomeworth it guys,5
"easy to walk past, but i recommend you don't if you are hungry. great simple examples of vietnamese street food. full of flavour and an accommodating staff to add to the experience.",4
"chicken pho was not bad, the spring roll and the fried rice was so so. the tofu pho was a bit bland.",3
"exceeded our expectations , honestly it was my friends birthday and apart from the food being so delicious. it was the customer service that really blew our minds . when they found it was my friends birthday they went out of their way to do a birthday treat for her . i will definitely come here again ! ",5
amazing set menu and great service! couldn't believe how cheap it was for such good food,5
nice authentic vietnamese food. and quite affordable with lunch menu!,5
"love the food. i wish the tables and stools were wider, not a lot of space between people.",4
"hot, tasty pho. i asked for no coriander and they did as requested. their cold vietnamese drip coffee was super tasty. uses lemon instead of lime in the pho which is unusual. the sweet potato veggie curry is delicious!",5
wonderful place ! really kind people and tasty food. good prices. special thanks to the nice greek server  our son enjoyed his birthday !,5
"its such a shame as i never even got to try the main dish. was told had to wait 20 minutes; 30 minutes later i was still waiting and no update. asked them how much longer it would be and they said 10 minutes. asked for the bill, total came to 4.46 and had to pay 5 because it was the minimum by card. terrible service",1
"comfortable vietnamese restaurants based at chinatown. set lunch only 9.95 (main course with starter), and they got serve for vegetarian food as well. friendly service and taste good ",4
good food slow stuff,4
"cocktails were great but staff were pushy in trying to turn over tables. it was a busy saturday evening, but so rude to make us leave when we were about to order dinner!",3
"small restaurant that does a vegetarian and non vegetarian set menu. the quality is good, but portion sizes are a little small. the tables are close together so it can feel a little cramped. more seating is available downstairs. the staff are also polite and helpful. booking is advised for dinner later in the week or at the weekend. ",4
"cozy, nicely decorated, quick service, and the food is goooood. the chilli squid is fantastic and the beef  bun is absolutely delicious. try the flan if you still have space for dessert.",5
"great service, not too expensive, authentic cuisine. loved it!",5
the set menu is awesome. so is the pork belly bao. i love the waiter that just took some initiative and brought us more beer when we had finished the first round.,5
it was one of the worst meals i had in a while. the aubergine taste like it was dipped in the oil that was used 5 times over. the pho  broth totally lacked flavour. there are better choices out there for good vietnamese,1
bbq short rib and chicken japenese bun is what i had. it was lovely will definitely go again for quick eat,5
"food was delicious. had the ribs and beef rolls. lovely. took about 25min before we got our mains. the steamed bbq honey pork bao burger was delicious.  would deff go back. the time out offer is only really worth it in the evening, otherwise you can get 2 course for 10 during lunch.",4
great spot in soho west end/theatreland. amazing 4 course meal super experience and attentive staff - check it out,5
lovely food great service,5
"went for the chicken pho to take away. service was really slow - ended up waiting 20min when originally told it would take 5. broth and noodles are ok, but you only get a few scraps of quite dry chicken so the 8 price tag doesn't really seem worth it. will avoid in the future.",2
"food was absolutely lovely and our waiter was very pleasant. it's quite small as you walk in, but there's loads of seating downstairs if it gets too busy. i'll definitely be trying out the new restaurant opening in oxford.",5
amasing food. good portions. gluten free.,5
used to be good but now the portion sizes look much smaller and the new staff are grumpy and rude.,1
lovley restaurant with great staff and testy food.,4
"very tasty food, great service and quiet place to have a late evening dinner !",5
"delicious,fresh & fast.really good flavours,& not too expensive.yum!",5
very good authentic vietnamese food. i go there few times a month. strongly recommend,5
great pho soup with beef at a very reasonable price,4
"so good! we tried the crispy lemongrass tofu, tofu summer rolls, the grilled aubergine and sweet potato bao burger, and the tofu bao burger. ive been a vegetarian for 16 years and this is some of the best tofu ive ever had! the summer rolls were also delicious and refreshing. i wish i lived in london so i could return frequently.",5
very nice ambiance and excellent food. around 20 per person including drinks.,5
"food is nice, a bit expensive. lots of rice based food, so it is a good idea for gluten free diets. but contactless doesn't work ;(",4
good food but quite unattentive service,3
great week day lunch deal ... 2 courses for 9.50. good service. great food. ,4
definitely satisfied my pho cravings since moving to london from sydney. the soup was absolutely delicious. will surely try more off the menu next time!,5
"pho and bun is the best vietnamese i've had in london. the meat spring rolls are fresh and delicious, the bun is tasty, and the pho was the best tasting broth since visiting vietnam. the decor is pretty trendy too.",5
the buns were amazing. big in size and tasted great. slightly disappointed about the sweet potato fries as they weren't crispy.would recommend checking it out though!,3
the pho is really good! we were just back from a holiday in vietnam. didn't expect to find a pho restaurant with such authentic favor in london. well done! ,5
"very cosy and yummy restaurant. the burgers are delish, and the vegetarian version comes almost guilt free (all considered a light meal). i almost had food envy looking at the person in front of me with a bowl of sticky rice and pork, that must have been amazing!",5
"the food was very tasty and they offer many gluten free options too. one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been, with very affordable prices. perfect location in the city centre and cosy environment. staff was very friendly and helpful. highly recommended.",5
"stick with their pho, the rest wasnt that good. we had the mango salad and calamari, both pretty flavorless.",3
absolutely fantastic food across from queens theatre.,5
"the grilled pork vermicelli is highly recommended, tasty and the taste brings you to vietnam immediately. other dishes also taste nicely. well done! reservation is recommended for them to arrange you the seats.",5
"had a wonderful meal, cannot recommend the tofu enough! we had the summer rolls, crispy tofu, tofu bao and aubergine bao, everything was incredible. service was prompt and attentive - we were seated quickly and never kept waiting.",5
"absolutely delicious! fresh and clean flavours, defiantly going back! really reasonable as well!",5
excellent food. very reasonable prices. recommend.,5
"fantastic vietnamese street food restaurant. good value especially if you find a tme-out voucher.  the seating is very squashed, but as to a friendly atmosphere. delicious food.",5
"best pho in london, great atmosphere and very friendly staff",5
delicious pho,5
tiny little restaurant but absolutely lovely food.,5
"pros: delicious food, great staff.cons: small portions for the price, toilets could be a lot cleaner.",4

delicious food and polite staff.,4
really surprised by how good this was. great photo and amazing grilled pork. will go again ,5
"really good quality food, nice cosy little place, would definitely recommend!",5
great tasting quality food for a great price 10 for a starter plus main meal 12-17h highly recommend the bao burger with cheese!,5
"dripping coffee wasnt show up at table like a  dripping coffee, they serve a cup of vietnamese coffee? pho pao taste good, nice pho and tender rare slice beef, soup is the soul which is a bit sweeter than the average.",4
great food and friendly staff - i will be back,5
"awful awful foods and staffs service isn't nice, but they include 12% of service charges for the bill. i don't understand how they got five star ratings. there are lot of good vietnamese restaurants in london but not this one. definitely not going to recommend here to anybody. yikes",1
nice pho,5
"delicious food, very friendly staff. could not ask for more.",5
"really good vietnamese food. big choice of dishes. the pork belly was delicious, the pho stock is on point, lots of flavour. nice atmosphere too with attentive service",5
good food very small tables and staff more interested in chatting than serving the people who pat their wages. all down to sub standard management,4
mint tea and pho! recommend recommend recommend,5
"fantastic, great food will definitely go again next time i'm in london. set meal deal was great value for money.",5
good food and friendly staff. the pork belly burger is interesting and the stir fried rice noodle is something special!,5
"such a wonderful viet foodbeef soup of the noodle was great! its deep beef taste and noodle also cooked well pork noodle tastes amazing as wellive had satisfied dinnerjust one thing theres no air conditioner indoor, therefore its a bit unpleasure to stay in and have hot food in the summer time",4
excelent braised beef pho soup ,5
2nd best pho in london. the crab spring roll is quite good too.,5
"the male servant did not respect me, did not bring me tissues and chopsticks, although we went first, very distinguished",1
"service is bad. we went in and the waitress was so rude, she just told us off that they didnt have a table.",1
great food at reasonable price,4
"cute place in soho, serving the best bao bun burger i've had to date. very cozy place, friendly staff. definitely a spot you can't miss for quality vietnamese cuisine. the sweet potato fries side were very crisp and delicious.",5
"great food, fab service, would highly recommend",5
my first experience with vietnamese food and i'm happy about it! pho&bun is a cool restaurant and the food was really good!,4

very nice spring rolls and the vegetable soup was fresh and nice! the place always busy and the staff are excellent!,3
very reasonable and nice - i loved the dessert!!!,5
friendly and fast service - and super tasty bao burgers!!!! big recommend.,5
tasty food in modern place with ok prices. young people. a portuguese worker there is top ,3
often go for lunch when in soho. they have added more veggie / vegan options. food is good but staff can be a bit unattentive - be firm.,4
"visited pho and bun for the first time 18/6/19 and found the food to be delicious. we chose the 4 course set menu priced at 16 and was very good value.friendly staff,great atmosphere. will definately be returning.",5
food was lovely but staff wanted to clear us out before we'd even properly finished our meals. felt like we were on a conveyer belt.,2
i was pretty disappointed with the food. not particularly flavourful nor fresh. the platter to start was just all over-fried and there wasn't very much of it. the crispy duck was probably the best part but was still only ok.,2
i would say foods are nice. but... staff are awful. you guys need to be more careful when you serve.  please be nice. i am happy to go again. but won't pay for tips never ever.,3
"was recommended by a friend who said it was one of the posher places in china town. wasn't impressed with decor, service was poor and slow. food was cold and only adequate, came out a random times including one starter coming in different parts over 30mins. price was very high for such a standard of food. wasn't happy at all.",1
this is the best chinese in town! excellent service and awesome food... the bill does not hurt your pocket at all! ,5
very tasty chinese food! the dim sum was great!,5
"very smart restaurant in chinatown, london.",5
the chinese stuff are not nice to the customers being very aggressive,1
great bef and broccoli.,4
nice food but not much atmosphere,3
"very unfriendly staff. they would serve dishes on your table without saying a word and throw the bill to you without even saying thank you. and they charge service fee. food is alright, not exactly delicious. would never recommend this place",2
"cozy asian restaurant in chinatown with delicious small plates of authentic food. service sometimes better than on other days but still o.k. large variety of dumplings on the menu, reasonably priced for centre of london. good quality food.was there twice, would go again for sure. reservation recommended",4
"extremely slow, dishes are served cold. asked them to microwave it, they delivered 15 minutes later cold again. stainless steel wires in tofu! they took back to redo, but never delivered again. even rice was not delivered. terrible service.",1
amazing selection of dim sum and very cosy place,5
"pretty good food, but really really slow had to wait nearly an hour between when the first and last main dish arrived xd",2
one of the better restaurants in londons chinatown,5
good food and nice swrvice,4
nice place and decent enough service,5
fabulous food,4
tried the evening dim sum here. they don't do chung feung and the dumplings and other dim sum are quite dry. no beef balls either. i would prefer normal dim sum to this.,3
i think this is the best eatery in chinatown.,4
"for chinatown, it's a step up from most of the other joints. i'm pretty happy here and will return.",4
very nice dimsum and not too expensive,5
"great food.  attentive service.  karaoke selection a little limited, but had a great time!",5
peking duck...delicious,5
horrible services,1
sooo delicious,5
karaokes fantastic. a bit expensive tho,5
food was lovely. service poor. had to keep calling the waitress ov er for help as it was our first visit. not helpful.,3
"most dishes were good, but expensive. horrible service.",3
"the food here is really good, especially the xiao long bao. unfortunately in my experience the service was bad to the point where it deters me from returning. if the service improves i would not be surprised if clientele doubles.",3
5 star food ... and setting ...staff need some work ..,4
"this was *the* food highlight of my visit to london. ask for the dim sum menu (if it's not too late in the evening). the scallop dumplings were the single most delicious thing i've eaten in recent memory, although the peking duck was a close tie. everything arrived quickly and the service was great.",5
faboulicious! great value for money. this is a real chinese cuisine restaurant with fresh ingredients and hand made dishes. big portions. suggested to avoid the crowd of the more common restaurants of china town. ,5
"nice place, tasty food... must try",3
"best dim sum for the same value anywhere in china town, and lovely atmosphere. other dishes are more expensive, would recommend getting dim sum meals here. ",5
first visit & over ordered base in the set lunch meant for big eaters and you could almost hear the waiter sniggering our poor choice.chinese food for non chinese.,2
have been here 3 times dumplings are fresh and very authentic but too bad that they don't serve cheung fun in the evenings. has atmosphere,3
"this restaurant does the best dim sum with a fusion. such as crispy black roe, wasabi dumplings, fried crispy prawns decorated as rabbits and much more. it is well decorated and stylish and the staffs are all friendly. excellent for a great meal with friends and family, dim sum is available during the evening too. ",5
they changed they menu. the once amazing vegetarian 'chicken' is no longer so great :/,1
called regarding a reservation but wasnt able to ask for info as it seems the receptionist doesnt understand english.,1
good food if a little expensive. very good service,4
home of the best turnip cake in london,5
"amazing dim sum top 5 in london , quick service , good prices , steamed dumplings are amazing",5
"modern clean atmosphere. ok food :)not the usual yum cha experience that you would expect in chinatown, it was a quieter space with modern decor. not too busy on a wednesday afternoon.",4
"food average, but expensive. staff horrible! please be a bit more careful with ginger pieces, piece like scallop is too big ",3
"awful! tourist food, salty and with nothing of chinese cuisine!",1
great food tastes lovely,5
"the dim sums are absolutely delicious and sophisticated with a modern twist to yet. the price are fair, too, so definitely good for your money. i would recommend it to anyone.",5
this is our favourite dim sum restaurant in london and our chinese friends always takes us there which should mean something right? not too expensive either.,5
nicest meal i've had in chinatown for ages. well worth a visit,4
"excellent chinese restaurant, lots of choice on the menu and very well priced in chinatown.",4
palm valley is an outstanding restaurant i strongly recommended for anybody and everybody to go the food is on another level possibly one of the best chinese restaurants in the world very elegant and classy chic establishment fantastic service,5
awesome  chinese cuisine.,5
very good fusion food. crappy for authentic chinese dishes. good place if you don't wish to queue on a saturday noon. quite pricey but not mind blowing like hakkasan. nice ambience. ,4
went here for my wives birthday with a party of around 20. they let us being in a cake of our own and did not charge us to serve it. the food was good as was the alcohol but it was not the cheapest place in town nor was it the best.,4
the food is interesting. not so classically chinese place.,4
dim sum heaven,5
"honestly speaking, their customer service is horrible and when you see a hair in your food while you eating which means at least it is not a restaurant should 12%service fee.",1
"not worth even 1/2 star. food tasted frozen and staff was rude. have u experienced some one saying, if you don't want to pay tip don't bother coming back, that too on your face. if not go and experience yourself.not worth going even once.",1
"busy restaurant but service is fast, really good dim sum variety, everything we ordered was delicious. would go again.",5
"not for chinese, only for ",1
great food. you just need to order everything,5
very lovely food and drink menu. lots of vegetarian options and there were items on the menu which i tried whilst i was over in china which tasted just as good over here. it was also a reasonable price. i particularly recommend the red lychee tea and the dim sum.,5
"the prawn and wasabi dumplings were nearly as good as the dumplings in hk, and the congee has a definite authentic taste to it. the maitred was fabulous and didnt give us the gweilo treatment. good sake menu too! definitely one of the stronger places in london for authentic canto food!",5
"excellent food, good friendly service, what more can i ask for. jc",5
"such amazing food, reasonable price. nice atmosphere and opens late. would definitely come again!",5
"not the cheapest place in chinatown, but absolutely worth it. everything we had was really, really tasty. portions were reasonable and service was friendly.",5
not amazing food bug really honest. with a good service and good price. if you want to eat correct chinese food for cheap go there.,3
not bad if you're looking for a slightly more upmarket joint in chinatown.,4
"food was fine, speed food came out was fine. speed drinks came out very poor. they did not understand much of what we said, trying to order was painful",2
average dumplings. service is slow. interior is nice.,3
"very delicious dim sum, service is very friendly and very fast buti got served my dessert before my dim sumand:be careful prices are 2-3 pounds higher than they say on the website or on the outside hanging menu, high prices for the portions still very good food",4
cosy restaurant for friends and family in the heart of london chinatown. quite spacious seating area. food is nice but can be considered expensive. can get dim sum for dinner! didn't get much service here as they only came to take our order and give us the food.,4
"one of the best dim sum place in london, exceptional service and top atmosphere, to be visited?",5
"amazing cantonese food, dumplins expectaculars.",5
"food was delicious, waiter for the night was extremely helpful and friendly!",5
excellent dim sum restaurant i come back regularly for lunch,5
great restaurant in chinatown. ask for dim sum menu - it is great but they don't always offer it straight away!,5
"riqusima comida, it's not to expensive dishes from  3.20",5
the food was absolutely amazing and the staff were so helpful and patient as it can be a bit of a challenge when you go with a big group. definitely recommend trying all the different dumplings they have to offer. oh if you feel brave i highly recommend the chicken feet.,5
tasty dim sum but unimpressed customer service! why they charge 12.5 % service charge is beyond me! won't be visiting again!,3
"great place in china townfood is very nice, staff is friendly. i've been coming here for over 6 years now most of the times i'm in london and i hope to come more often",5
their customer services could be better. the waitresses will place your food on the table without telling you the name of the meal and whos it is.so you are sat there trying to figure out what the name of the meal is and who ordered it.some of the meat that they served was brown on the outside and pink inside.,1
excellent food and servive. open until after midnight so great choice for after theatre food.,5
nice and reasonable prices for the area. food is alright too with a good variety and taste normal,4
"the food was so nice, definitely will go back next time!!! the prawn and chives dumplings were delicious, definitely recommended!! the balance of the filling in the dumplings are just right and the flavour is yum!!!",5
"beware cash onlythe food and service were great, until we had to pay. turns out, their card machine broke and they did not have the courtesy to inform us prior to eating.",3
"lovely restaurant, great food nice staff",5
"always my go to if i am around in china town, nice decor and  the staff are always smiley,  friendly and polite the menu is vast, always spoilt for choice, but what ever i choose never lets me down also a nice choice of wines.",5
adored the food and very impressed with service. staff had difficulties with 4 mysoginistic drunk men,5
great food and service. i will visit again and recommend,5
"lovely food and friendly, helpful service. amazing decor and atmosphere.",5
the best dim sum!!,5
competition in chinatown is rife and so the slightest things that aren't right are noticed. such as cold food and mistimed service. food overall was good but other places offer better value and the service we've come to expect.,3
"most dishes tastes ok, but the radish cake had no radish in it.",3
best ever,5
great food and friendly staff,5
"read the extensive menu, order a few dimsum esp turnip cake. order more as you need. huge portions. great flavour. def will be back for more",5
"came here twice for just food, and another two more times for karaoke and food. food is fantastic, especially the dim sum (a bit pricier than other restaurants but its worth it). karaoke rooms are great, songs are a little dated but perfectly reasonable with a very wide selection.",5
well presented dim sum at good prices.,4
amazing food and really friendly staff. they have a karaoke room upstairs.shame they charge for extra chill oil,5
very nice dim sum and friendly stuff !,5
had a fantastic lunch here?!,5
"excellent food, nice atmosphere, and great service",5
"dark environment,because of dark lights...high price with small portion of food...salty food and not well done meat",2
"might be my favourite dim sum place in chinatown. good quality food, friendly staff, nice prices and nice classy dark ambience. a cut above the other choices in the area.",5
the food was very nice and portions were generous. the staff was friendly and happy to explain the dishes on the menu. will definitely come back again.,5
"you can have dim sum even after 5pm which is good. but the service was not the best. waitress was yawning, beer was served without glass. food was ok but not great. tea was served for four of us prior to our order and we found it costed around 10gbp? we probably go different place next time.",3
i've taken chinese parents from mainland china here and they were impressed. london locals come back here regularly despite the fact it's in the centre of china town. the dim sum menu is phenomenal and available all day so ask for it,5
good food and dim sum is available all day!,4
the best chinese. we travelled 100 miles to eat here.,5
"if you want to eat the real thing thats the place to go in china town , great food , fresh items nice stuff and good atmosphere .the picture will speak better than can i write this time .",5
good dim sums,5
probably the best place to go for classical and unique dim sum in londons china town.what they serve here is unique and so its definitely more than what you would expect to get in a chinese restaurant.try the teas too!,5
good chinese restraunt,4
cosy place with great food and fast service,5
it was expensive but we enjoyed our meal. the food was delicious.,5
great dumplings!,5
"trash karaoke, bad smell, bad  equipments, but the worst is the staff, a young man, kick us off when the time is not reached, never smile, no service! fire this stupid guy, otherwise your restaurant would be worse in the future.",1
not really for vegans and vegetarians. the waiters laughed at me when i asked for vegetarian options,3
"great dim sum, intimate atmosphere.  recommended.",4
"food was good but,we saw him write our order on the paper and stuff was still missing that we had to ask for twice after which was a long wait. didnt pay any attention to us and only really spoke after we payed : /",2
"came for dim sum,  really bad service, the waiters were really rude with some waiters just ignoring us and overall not very attentive. had to ask for our drinks four times, none of the dim sum we ordered came with the sauces so had to ask multiple times. even though food was pretty good the service ruined the experience sadly.",1
"smart and more expensive end of gerrard street's range of chinese restaurants. some dishes excellent, others less so.",3
"great dim sum, served all day. dim sum noodle and rice dishes not on par. good service.nice contemporary looking restaurant.dim sum 3 to 5 average.family of 5 65 with soft drinks only.would recommend the wasabi dumplings, paper wrapped spring rolls and garlic prawn springrolls.",3
always a good branch,4
terriable service,1
"dim sum is very good, but i waiting for a long time to get my foods, so cant come sunday.",3
good chinese food. friendly service.,4
"cheap and so full. dim sum is one of my favourite food!if i can, i want to order 10 plate of dim sum.daily lunch is between 12pm and 5pm.so better to go before 5pm. if you are group, booking is better. the prawn dim sum with special sou sauce, it is the best ever!!!!",4
great ambience and lovely staff. the food was scrumptious as well! great cantonese cuisine!!,5
"quality of the food was not as good as expected, the karaoke private room are very nice though",2
"there are better (and cheaper) places to yum cha in chinatown. honeycomb tripe is pretty good though, but lo bak go very disappointing",2
"terrible food and terrible service, even for china town low standards",1
went for lunch on a saturday. big table for 2 of us and friendly staff. had 6 dim sums plus teas and soft drinks for 30. food was excellent and all had a unique taste and looked better prepared than other places. would recommend.,5
"very nice dim sum, staff were helpful and reasonably priced. i would recommend this restaurant to others.",5
great food. best in china town. it's a little pricey but well worth it. great stuff too. you have to try the aubergine tofu hotpot.,5
great food and nice customer service,5
"this smart restaurant in the middle of china town is lovely. clean and modern which is the first draw, but after that let the food do all the talking. we had some chicken noodles and several of the dim sum which were all delicious in their own way. thoroughly recommend the place.",5
"best chinese i've had anywhere, fantastic dumplings.",5
"having dim sum around the world for years. well prepared, good selection, good service, quick (2pm). price/quality ok. will come again",4
"decent dim sum place in chinatown - before 5pm at almost half price which is good value - nice setting, though a bit dark for during the day",4
"really good, slightly more up-market chinese restaurant in the heart of chinatown.we had the evening dim-sum menu and everything was fresh, tasty and just the right amount of heat.well worth a visit if you're looking for somewhere just that little bit special.",4
"a lovely place which serves very delicious food and dim sum also in the evening. the interiors are elegant, service is fast and efficient and the food is delicious and served nicely. you get to circle your order and you get it served. prices are good. i would definitely go back.",5
keep coming back. great food and reasonable prices. great for work events as well. we go mainly for the dim sum but the mains are delicious too. service can be hit or miss sometimes but overall we're there for the food not the pleasantries :d,5
very nice food and good customer service,4
amazing..great place,5
6 of us dined and every dish apart from one was below average. we sent back 3 dishes. the dumplings were stone cold and the pork belly was simply vile. the sauce tasted off! all the dishes were dry and tasteless. maybe the chef was off that day? nothing upmarket here except the price!,2
really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. very friendly staff that took care of us and was always there if we needed anything. would definitely recommend this place for everyone wanting to get chinese food.,5
great singapore noodles,4
"the foods were very delicious but they were not kind. if you think only important the taste, there is very nice.",5
love the crispy duck breast!,4
"expensive, gorgeous roast duck, tasty dumplings.",4
"chrage 2.5 for some chopped red peppers just 5g.   they explained  chilly peppery in london  is very expensive, but it is 1.69 per pack 100g in next china market.   liars..",1
"one of the very few places that serve dim sum in the evening. good selection of dumplings, fair prices for the location. not my number one choice for dim sum at lunchtime but definitely one of the better places for an authentic cantonese experience.",4
scallops and spinach dumplings and rice paper wrapped prawn are the best! plus the staff is super nice.,5
went to eat here when it wasn't busy yet the food took so long to arrive and some of it was cold. it was obvious it had been left to one side whilst the other dishes were being prepared. the poop sack hadn't been removed from the prawns. it's a shame can't understand why on a quiet day the food would take so long to arrive,1
nice clean restaurant with elegant modern design. tasty dim sum.,5
poor service and rude staff. good food.better options available in chinatown with much more polite attitude.,1
"good chinese food in china town london. liked the shrimp and the pork buns, dumplings could have been better.",4
ridiculous gratuity factored into the receipt! staff are not the most friendly.,3
good place for dim sum but make sure they give you the dim sum menu as well as the a la carte menu. quite dark downstairs but brighter on the first floor.,4
"best cantonese dim sum in london. great atmosphere, nice service, fair prices, especially at lunchtime",5
"food was good as was service, recommended",4
pleasant restaurant in a very busy part of london,4
"great restaurant, love the atmosphere. we sit upstairs and was very pleasant nice staff staff and the food was great.  love the orientl lychee red tea!",5
what a lovely find. great food and really helpful staff. would recommend booking or getting there early as it gets busy especially on weekends,5
"really good tasting food. service was a little lacking compared to previous visits, hence 4 stars. starter was served after the main with no explanation, but didn't take away from the great taste.",4
"the food was good, but slightly overpriced and the service could be slightly improved..",4
"food was good, including vegetarian option. service was okay. bit expensive.",3
dim sum was excellent. definately going back.,3
"absolutely loved it, looking forward to my next visit.",5
excellent food and nice private rooms ideal for special occasions and birthdays. we ate a lot and only paid 16 pounds.,4
"the place is clean, service is gread and the food is amazing. highly recommended",5
"great food! food was tasty, service was quick and efficient and staff friendly! atmosphere was quiet too so you could talk with your dinner company!",5
good chinese food at reasonable prices. service was also excellent.,5
"lovely swanky restaurant, relaxed ambiance, very attentive waiters and waitresses and very quick to rectify any issue. thank you so much for a lovely evening ",5
beautiful malaysian/chinese cuisine and great dining experience,5
superb dim sum and dumplings in london's china town. would make it my favourite place to eat if i lived in london,5
the average price of the dishes ware 1-2 pounds highe4 than other chinese places in china town. but the price is very reasonable and all the foods were amazing. strongly recommend,5
"excellent quality food, service could be improved but sort of expected on a busy friday night in a multi-storey restaurant.karaoke rooms are also available for booking in for food/ drinks during your session.would say that prices could be a tad bit more affordable.",4
perfect for lunch. tasty dumplings in a huge selection. colorful doughs with juicy fillings. the shrimp rice cake crepe is also great. fresh jasmin tea is served in pretty teapots. lunch is quite cheap but dinner is pricey. friendly and attentive staff - recommend this place! :-),5
"the best dim sum in chinatown! tastes really good for a good price, and the staff are really kind. if you order a lot or too little they'll let you know, especially if they can tell you're inexperienced with dim sum. i've taken many friends here for lunch. i haven't ordered from the main menu though, so i'm not sure how it is.",5
"amazing staff, really nice food that was cooked well. the menu has a good variety with some interesting dishes if you really like sea food. if you like cold tiger beer you have to ask them or you get the warm bottles at the front of the chiller",5
i've been recently to plum valley with few friends on sunday to have a lovely dim sum lunch. the food was delicious and the atmosphere was great. one of the best chinese restaurant in gerrard street.,5
"delicious dim sum, hot and fresh, excellent flavours. great service, and nice decor and atmosphere. good prices too. even the toddler loved it!",5
looks nice but tastes awful. never go again. there are so many better chinese restaurants in china town. wanted to try a new restaurant today but it turned out a big mistake. disappointing.,1
probably the best chinese in china town. highly recommend the dim sum and noodles. flower tea is a must try.,4
dim sum - superb. plus the noodles (110 on the menu) i recommend to anyone,5
second time in my life i went for dim sum and this time i had an excellent guide. staff very polite and friendly. we ordered six plates of dim sum and a turnip cake. all arrived quickly. the turnip cake dish was the highlight for me. i would definitely recommend this place to others.,5
tasty aromatic duck. nice modern style and decoration.,4
"very nice interior, tasty dim sum, and above average service. having eaten dim sum all my life i highly rate this place. the price is very affordable too! note that i went during lunch time, not sure what its like during dinner.",5
good dim sum (also served in the evening). much cleaner and better service than many local competitors. portions not that big for the cost but food is good quality. would recommend.,4
great variety of dim sum.  really enjoyed.  try the eel!,4
great experience. the service was fast. the menu was extensive and the food was excellent. the peking duck was definitely the highlight. make sure to order the sampler and try lots of small plates. it takes numerous visits to even make a dent in the extensive menu. definitely a great spot for dim sum. highly recommended.,5
top notch dim sum.,5
really great food but a tad expensive. about .5 to 1 pound more per dish compared to the 2 other dim sum restaurants i visited very nearby. but the atmosphere was great with the seating being several floors high and only 6-8 tables per area so it doesn't sound like you're in a crowded protest.,4
lovely food and good service.,4
"food was delicious, friendly staff",5
"food is okay, a bit overpricedthe service is horrible. like the waitress hates us.",2
"great yum cha, fresh and delicious. friendly efficient staff we would return again.",4
really nice dim sum for a reasonable price in central london,5
we waited for a table for 5 minutes (which isnt a compliment thats understandable) then we went down stairs to our table. waited 20 mins to be seen and then ordered our food. we got dim sum and we got 4 - 5 dishes. all were over prised and tasted horrible.,1
"great service, delicious dim sum!",5
really loved this place but for the past few years the taste seemed to have changed and the portions are much smaller than it used to be which is a shame because it was one of my favourite places hope they go back to the old taste and portions.,3
a bit pricy than it used to be. great eating in london's china town nonetheless!,5
food was excellent but gets two stars as they basically told us to f off after we paid but where still finishing our wine. #rude,2
"delicious, quick, friendly. ask for the dim sum menu. between than the the regular menu we were a little overwhelmed by the amount of choices but everything we ordered was wonderful. we were a party of 5 and ordered a bunch of plates to share and the portions were great for sharing. very tasty, would highly recommend.",5
one of the best place to enjoy laksa,5
"nice food in here, very authentic malaysian dishes! recommended!",5
"tasty, flavorsome cafe style street food.",3
"very nice, authentic malay restaurant, great food and fast service. very busy place!",5
lovely small but very busy restaurant. service was fast and prices very reasonable. i ordered an apple and mint drink and the prawn samba with plain boiled rice. i thoroughly enjoyed my meal. the portion was a good size for me but i don't like big meals. i would go again just to have that dish. worth a visit if you are in chinatown.,5
really good food with friendly staff,5
"the food and the servers are really nice! even though we had a complication with the food, the people there were more than happy to compensate with drinks (which are stellar)",4
price expensive n the food was ok2,3
great location- in china town. food is flavourful and service is great.,5
"friendly place run by singaporeans. nice food. bobor hitam much recommended. not many veg options, and the dhal for the roti canai was so-so, hence the 4. but will go back to try other dishes, and maybe come back and increase my rating....?",4
great food. rendang is awesome! and good service. thanks for the rendang fix lol,5
ok for quick meal desi,2
"small, busy and good halal malaysian restaurant. it's not all that cheap but the food is good, and portion size is good too. it is a bit cramped for seating, so privacy can be a bit of a factor if you're with  friends or something. prepare to queue if in a modest group.",4
"decent food, just be wary of cutlery pots on the table. ask staff for fresh cutlery.",4
"one of my friend got no food at all,   very disappointed, food  was too salty, waiting too long for food, still goes wrong !",1
the food in this place is super good!! highly recommend it - very very tasty and great value for money.,5
"did a takeaway yesterday. had high hopes but was disappointed. the hainanese felt precooked, the chicken wasn't tender. the roti in the roti canai just want up to the mark (gopals corner does a much better job) and the chicken curry though delicious was very very oily.",3
"if you want to try some singaporean/ malaysian dish but want to keep it light and mild, then the hainanese chicken rice is the one. simple yet flavourful.",4
"amazing food, great service. cozy atmosphere... worth finding this gem. outstanding flavors.",5
"got recommended this place by a malaysia friend, and it really didn't disappoint!! authentic singaporean and malaysia dishes!  reasonable prices and quick serve. one of the best places to go when you get your asian fried noodles crave!",5
"nice food, busy tho. halal option in that area.",4
"my singaporean girlfriend loved it, definitely taking her again.",5
beautiful food. unimposing but great.,5
"lovely food, very authentic flavours. their raffles laksa is full of flavour, really well done. beef rendang melts in your mouth, and the assam fish curry is also incredibly tender.quick and polite service too, well worth stopping here if you're in china town",5
"super good, lots of variety, super tasty, off the beagen path experience!",5
we all absolutely loved the food. great pricing. highly recommend,3
"fantastic service and food , just like when i used to live in malaysia .",5
"very tasty malaysian food. fast service. even at lunch time. clientele is a mix of local brits, local chinese people and tourists. very reasonable prices. delicious. will have to visit again soon.",5
"great casual malaysian place; i keep trying other malaysian restaurants in london, but they are never quite as good!",5
the starters are awesome! for main courses they serve quite big portions.,4
good food but crowded,4
not really for those who prefer more spice in their food. very crammed and staff don't seem to give full attention to their customers.,2
ok malaysian fare. good range of options but the taste is hit or miss.,3
tasty authentic malaysian food. fairly priced as well. will definitely go again. they do delivery as well.,5
"the satay wasn't really satay.  it was fried chicken pieces on skewers.  you cannot taste the honey in the marinate. so either improve the dish to be more satay-like or otherwise just state in the menu,  fried chicken pieces on sticks....",3
always love this place.,5
kangkong is good. beef rendang way too salty. nice atmosphere just like home.,4
proper malaysia and singapore food,4
malay cuisine.... delightful,4
first time trying such food. was definitely good food. halal too!,5
nice malaysian food,4
great food. love this place.,5
great food. very noisy fun place,4
"they have the best chao kwai tiu in the world, i mean it!",5
went there with my mum. loved the nasi lemak coconut rice. ordered char kuey teow however slightly disappointed. tasted too salty and the flat noodles too thick n chewy. surprised that it has wok hei which is hard to find in other msian restaurant. will come back again anyway.,4
excellent indonesian - and they got seven of us a table.,5
"delicious. crispy roti, great prawn gravy mee. carrot cake on point. ",5
staff was very friendly and menu was reasonably priced. would highly recommend!,5
very slow service. even my coke took nearly 15mins to arrive! i ordered lor mee and it was the worst i've ever had! the only good thing was the helpful and friendly waitress,2
it's fine but really singapore raffles laksa. and seriously fried chicken with lor new err wattt,4
"cafe style restaurant, fantastic food, good service, great mocktails !",5
"great staff, very professional and time efficient.excellent menu. a must place to eat in chinatown.",5
"the food was ok. contents of the laksa were a little scarce compared to the same dish i eat in australia, it was also a bit bland. we had to queue outside so it's popularity was obvious. not sure i would eat there again if i found myself in london's chinatown.",4
always wanted to try this place out and finally had a chance. the nasi lemak was creamy and delicious. the hainan chicken rice was flavourful. i wasn't disappointed at all.,4
one of my favorite places to eat in london. they are quick and efficient with their service.,5
great restaurant. delicious food and great service. alice lee is a sweat heart. we will definitely come back.,5
"great food, great service, little cramped and the alcove we were sat in was a little low ceilinged (my fault for being too tall though). will go back...!",4
friendly workers and the portion was generous however the food lack taste and its quite blend.,2
"good food, good service. very small and tight space. especially if you are going with 4+ people",4
it's not that easy to find great malaysian food in london - this is the best i've had here so far.,5
wanted to try the laksa but unfortunately it was sold out so we ordered the beef rendang. it was delicious and not too pricey. i miss home!,5
really good asian restaurant with a wide array of delicious asian dishes that are freshly cooked and served with the best ingredients and with the help of a very friendly and professional staff as well.,4
"food is good. service is good. price is okey to be a bit pricy as it is in china town. the awkward thing is the way they put table for customers. if you order more than 2 dishes, definitely you will be struggling for spacing. and the tables are very closed each other and felt uncomfortable for customers.",4
halal malaysian food; tastes really good. would suggest you to make reservations because can be full and no seats. definitely would go there again:),5
outstanding service and very tasty food.but i order laksa when food coming is it warm and ingredients was freezing like just take out from fridge.after i request for microwave service.,3
"my food (soup noodle dish) tasted of absolutely nothing. other members of the group enjoyed their dishes, but be careful what you order.",3
"quite authentic asian food. i've had beef rendang and it tasted as good as in malaysia. busy little restaurant, bit dated decor but fully acceptable because food is nice and meals are below 10 :-)",4
had an amazing time and good quality food. the service was amazing from start to finish. thank you alice you looked after us well.,5
the food was amazing. it was served in huge portions with reasonable prices. the customer service was quick too and they can accomodate huge families too as they are a 2 floors restuarants. food taste near to authentic and definitely would love to come here again if stop by in london.,5
"my humble opinion on their malaysia food is just an average. it is not bad but not as delicious as the review by others. in term of their service wise, can be improved better because of their staff comes across less friendly and a bit fierce. to sum up, this restaurant is a bit over-rated.",3
"in the heart of chinatown, quite busy from the afternoon right until late night. be prepared to queue. and youll have to wait for your order to come, the service is polite and efficient. the interiors are plain and simple and the food is good, but not great - both in taste and presentation.",4
"food quality is outstanding! however, due to lack of staff customer service was lacking. there was more than 20 minutes difference between the serving of each dish ordered and had to remind them too. overall, the restaurant can easily be a 5 star if the customer service improves as the food is always fantastic.",4
so delicious! fantastic food that reminded us of our old life in singapore - and such friendly helpful staff. good value too - you must makan here!,5
delicious roti. not enough canai,4
"we have been regulars here for about 6 yrs now. the good here is the best and very reasonably priced. the best stuff to try here are: chilli crab, prawn mee goreng, beef rendang, chicken satay, arguably the best chinese, malaysian restaurant for food in soho..",5
the best laksa that i ever eat in my life,5
their food is too blend and the portion is too big. it's a bit dissapointed!,2
good food. fast cook,5
"large servings so although a main dish might be say, around 8 or so, it will fill you up. i love the char kway teow - no clams too. i've always hated clams  bandung is lovely. always a busy place. if you miss singaporean or malaysian food, come here to get your fix.",5
"staff were friendly and helpful, but food was over rated. it looked good, but lacks in taste.",2
food is very good and authentic.the dowside is that you will probably have to sit too close to strangers. but the price that that you have to pay for good quality food for a very reasonable price.,5
amazing place. it was muslim friendly and had amazing food. would definitely come here again.,5
the food here is authentic and delicious and the portions are generous. service is really efficient and the place has a lively atmosphere with lots of noisy chatter and happy faces. we had to queue on a friday night to get in but they were attentive and got us in quickly. it's cheap too - we were delighted when the bill came!,5
"great malaysian/singaporean food, reasonably priced. halal. casual dining place but clean, great staff and fast service. highly recommended.beef rendang is to die for!",5
excellent food quality for great price. i've not been to malaysia but my friend who i went with had lived there and says this is the first place in london that tastes truly authentic.,5
a bit of a wait for my 6 people family to get a table (quicker for small group). food is ok for malaysian taste.,3
"food is good, horrible service, they forgot my wife's food and didn't even apologise. shame",1
service was underwhelming and food was just ok. ordered chicken curry and the food came lukewarm and potatoes were pretty much cold. nothing really stood out.,2
"really good, the staff is really nice !",4
very nice hot lemon tea and stir fry carrot cake.,4
best malaysian and indonesian food in the china town and quick service with friendly staff and but spaces are only limited.,4
really good malaysian food in the heart of chinatown. they offer 2 and 3 course meals for a great price (15 and 17 pounds). will definitely be going back.,5
"taste authentic, don't have to wait for the food and the dish is enough for two.",5
been coming here for years. used to be really good. recently menu changed and signature nasi goreng is not what it used to be. also pots of tea off menu. service was so terrible last time we left before ordering.,2
"i love rasa sayang, i always get take away from here, fried carrot cake is great, roti chennai, there's a good atmosphere it's often busy because the food is very good",5
"great authentic malaysian food, great service and lots of tables on the basement level, though there are tons of people so it might be good to book in advance. definitely will come back again!",5
malaysian restaurant in chinatown. great location. standard malaysian food... nothing exceptional... very average... small portions... expensive for what it is... surly service from disinterested staff. avoid.,2
i have been going here for a few years. food is consistently good and authentic malaysian. there are always malaysians eating in there so i am sure i am not alone in thinking how good the food is. it can get really busy so be prepared to queue for a table.,5
love the rendang!!! missing cendol today though,5
"four of us ,me and my husband and my brother with his girlfriend had an amazing time! service was excellent and food was delicous!",5
went hear 5 years ago and the food and service was average. my most recent visit was a much better improvement. food was lovely and service was quick and polite. would definitely come again.,4
"definitely worth going. go for wat tan hor, its my malaysian comfort food.",4
another delicious meal with quick service and at a good price.,5
the beef rendang and chicken satay was superb. especially if you are asian and have spent more than a week in uk. we dined here 2 days in a row.,5
a good malaysian restaurant,4
"great food. always fast service of food. you don't come here for the ambience or friendly wait staff. because it doesn't matter. good food that is affordable, a contradiction to london food and pricing.",4
very yummy chicken rice! (although i do agree that their soda serving size is annoyingly small!),5
delicious food and very friendly staff.,5
food's ok. i mean some of it it pretty nice but some of the soup lacked seasoning. not a place i would go back for south east asian.,3
"excellent restaurant, order the nasi lemak. you can't find good malaysian food like this in london. typical chinatown restaurant busy and quite crowded. very good customer service and quick food.",5
excellent food and service!,5
best place for quick and tasty food. recommend the hot tea milk and roti canai,5
"truly authentic food, and really popular with folk from southeast asia.",5
my favourite malaysian restaurant. the seasoning and portions are faultless. really friendly staff and a fantastic atmosphere.,5
prawn mee taste good with a mild heat but the prawn and squid were slightly lacking in flavour. fast eat out with decent prices though.,3
"as a malaysian myself, i must say the fried mee (mee goreng) different from the authentic malaysian taste. however, it tastes good as fried mee.",5
excellent! delicious food  and great service. will definitely return.,4
"excellent value for money,  good service (we were going to the theatre so didn't have much time).",4
"genuine malaysian restaurant. our favourite place in chinatown. style reminiscent of food available in thailand as well (we used to live in thailand). wide choice of meals, drinks or desserts. generous portions so good value for money.",5
"one of the very few places in london that serves good quality laksa. happy with the quality of food, however the place is super cramped and noisy with bad acoustics. relocating to a more spacious location would make a lot of sense.",3
"fantastic little singaporean eatery located in china town. cheap and cheerful is the order of the day with seriously tasty laksa, nasi goreng and other culinary treats of the malay peninsula. destined to become one of my go to places in soho",5
service by adwin and edmund was excellent! food is also exceptionally excellent for southeast asians who miss food away from home.,5
"yummy fresh food, roti with dahl, mee goreng is my favourite so far. the lime and mint juice is delicious....had 2. would definetly recommend.",4
really nice food in here!,5
restaurant of a real malaysian-singapourian cuisine. a soup with scallops and noodles was very delicious . for a european it may be a bit too spicy but tastes too good not to try. a dessert with tapioca was nothing special however. among all the restaurants in china town i consider this one as one of the best ones,5
this is my first malaysian food so i don't know how authentic they are but the food i  had was very nice and would eat it again. the only complaint i have is that some of the waiters/waitress could be more happy when facing their customers. a little smile would help.,4
didn't really liked the ambiance,2
"a halal malaysian restaurant in china town. portion is huge, if you are not really hungry consider to share few plates in your group. price is in the mid-range and ask whether the menu is spicy or not if you are not get use to asian spicy food. quite popular amongst malaysian & indonesian residing in london.",4
"this place is no tourist trap! the food is delicious, the staff are friendly and efficient and the price is right. highly recommended.",5
delicious eastern food. would certainly return.,5
"really nice place where to taste original malaysian food. small rooms and sometimes a bit crowded but worth it. good quality/cost ratio, wide menu with lots of dishes.",4
"probably the only halal china town restaurant in london, if you want to treat your friends who are keen on halal food, it is a good place. prices are not low or too high, yet reasonable given the quality and portions.",5
they might have changed their cook in 2018. it is not as authentic as in 2017 (speaking from a singapore perspective). not necessarily less tasty though.,4
"everything was very tasty and good value. we tried two classic dishes, the char kway teow and the roti canai, i would definitely recommend both.",5
authentic malaysian food. good service.,5
"love this place. har mee, chicken satay skewers and oyster pancake are my staples & they hardly fail me.",5
"good service an tasty dishes, like beef randang, but dissapointingly the satay chicken was a poor imitation of the real thing.",4
delicious authentic malaysian/singaporean cuisine. hard to find in central lodnoni thought id never see pandan cake outside of singapore!good value too. three adults 40 quid and we are overly full.,5
very yummy malaysian food eat in or take away....,4
"most importantly is its halal. food nice but bland, a lot of varieties though. good if u missed home cooked. very popular place.",3
"great local place for quick beautiful taste of malaysian/singaporean dishes. the food is traditional and reminiscent of typical diners. the staff are friendly but be warned they are incredibly busy. good quick service, great food. the laksa is a gem.",5
our tastebuds were celebrating!!!@,5
"good food, decent price, bit cramped",4
racist and rude,1
lovely place and very nice food. excellent customers service buy every one and specially alien.  would love to go back and recommend it to every one to try. thank you rasa sayang,5
"good restaurant, accommodated for our large group even though we had no reservation. helpful and patient, thank you.",5
the laksa is incredible! authentic food.,5
"good food, but poor service. restaurant was quite cold, luckily my food kept me warm! some issues with returning accurate change if paying by cash.",3
"we came for the first time looking for something similar to ramen, however the experience was different and attractive. the food has personality and the flavors are intense. the atmosphere is vibrant and even though you have to queue most of the times, service is fast and attention is perfect.",5
the foods are delicious! i like the nasi lemak.,4
honest decent tasty malaysian food. its hard to find good malaysian food in london but this is definitely the closest.,5
outstanding food and great service,5
best authentic asian food & reasonable price. staff are polite & helpful too.,5
"loved the food! beef rendang was excellent - maybe the best i've had, and my mother in law is singaporean, so i've had a fair bit of rendang. but don't tell her i liked this one better! strongly recommended!",5
hectically busy restaurant offering malaysian cuisine. try the seafood laksa and the pulling tea. also simple but lovely desserts,5
amazing food. very tight and small restaurant,5
serving big but taste..still spore style is much better.. pricing too high,3
more of malaysian taste than singapore but still really good,5
excellent food and good value for money! restaurant is a little small but all is worth it for the food...,4
very quick service. great food,5
the best malaysian restaurant in london by far!,5

"the food was amazing. the noodles, milkshakes and satay was exceptional! i rated it 5/5 because the food was mind blowing. i recommend this to people who love malaysian/singaporean food.",5
"to be honest we where party of 3 and none of us enjoyed the food. allot of fish paste used which was overpowering any flavour.  the lemon ginger juice was great. the only reason i went in because it's halal resturant. the staff was great,",2
i normally have the ipoh hor fun which i always enjoy. today i also tried the sago gula  melaka for dessert. it was slightly too sweet but still yummy. service is quick and friendly.,4
"food is nice but could be better. portion is . service unfortunately is not very good, its like they dont care. still, i love me some halal malay-singaporean food!",3
"food great, price ok, service a bit grumpy",4
very bad service. food never comes.,2
yummie indo foods.. but please make the correct cendol drink ala indonesia.. thx,3
amazing authentic malaysian/singaporian food.,5
"great food, tasty and spicy. a little gem between all the bland fried noodle places.",5
"delicious food, good service, great restaurant",5
i had the char kuay teow and sadly it was really bland and unevenly heated as if it was warmed up in the micro.,3
"foods are tasty and in very big portion. price wise shall be say reasonale down here. ownef by a malaysian boss, should support. ha..ha",4
good cuisine. this was my second time and very pleased with the staff and of course food,4
"jimin, jungkook and jin were here",5
"the best char kuay teow in london, always go there to when i have a craving. definitely recommend!",5
best meal of 2019,5
"went for food there last week and got e coli, still in bed recovering! do not go here!",1
"excellent food and customer service!! i went with my boyfriend and we ordered one menu and a couple of plates more, the lady who served to us was very kind and friendly even though they were kind of busy that night. i recommend it and we will come back for sure.",5
amazing malaysian food. authentic to say the least.,5
one of my favourite asian restaurants in london and worth the trip across town to get there. haven't tried a dish that wasn't delicious. mee goreng outstanding.,5
"i was scouting a place for roti canal post a trip to malaysia. stumbled across this gem! the lamb, nasi goreng and roti canai is incredibly good! good value for portions. i can't wait to go back again! note: they don't take reservations.",5
if you fancy singaporean or malaysian cuisine this is the right restaurant for you . so many choices and great taste as well. value for money and good service.,4
"delicious spicy crab noodle soup!  great value and quick service. yummy, must visit!!!",5
great food!!! very friendly staff. normally there is queue but it's moving fast.,5
"been here many times, love the mooli cake and laksa. friendly staff, quick service. cant sit inside for too long as they are always busy and would expect you to leave when you finish your food. but food wise they are honestly great!",4
quick service decent food and decent price,4
the dumplings are so good! went in there randomly on a weekend and it was the best malaysian place i have been to!,5
always go everytime can not decide where to eat in china town :p the food is good and not expensive,5
food was super tasty (esp curry dishes) and the portion sizes were great. overall i would go again,4
nice food asian style in china town soho,4
"delicious food, affordable price, and friendly staffs",5
nice restaurant with interesting food. the crab is delicious even if a bit of work to go through. the other dishes felt rather ordinary but good for a quick bite while in chinatown.,3
really nice food.great,5
"excellent food at a reasonable price. staff was very nice, and take great care of guests with allergies.",5
not need me to tell u what to do if you are malaysian here... order all the food...amazing malaysian cuisine,5
"great tasting chineses food for a decent price, a very busy place but well worth the short wait.",5
"absolutely outstanding. i frequently go to malaysia and am half malaysian and the food here is authentic, great value and extremely good. the nasi lemak is ",5
food. service. best cheap eat in china town. love it everything i go.,5
good spot for authentic malaysian cuisine. price point is decent for their serving size.,5
"love their laksa and their nasi lemak is amazing! also, its all halal!",5
my first time at a malay restaurant. the food was full of flavours and spices. definitely going there again.,5
delicious malaysian food at a relatively low price,5
"love the food! my husband's most favorite restaurant in china town so far :)the place was very crowded when we went there, yet the service was speedy and nice.the prices were relatively affordable.we visited this restaurant twice in our last london trip and will surely come back again in our next trip to london next year :)",5
yummy food! absolutely worth the wait,5
in and out thats there best way to describe this little place. food comes very fast and its tasty however a bit stingy on the meat.,4
"lovely and cosy, service was good and food did come quickly and tasted great only one on the dishes was only not hot enough.",4
"singaporean and malaysian verified. (nasi lemak, roti chennai, satay can be improved, else laksa, cha kway tiao all good)",5
first time trying here via uber takeaway. we had:char kway teopan fried carrot cake (actually made of mooli)chicken satayroti canai with curry sauce coconut riceeverything was very nice and the portions were huge - doesnt look it in the picture but the noodle and mooli were huge. highly recommend.,4
please. don't hire amateur waiters. and customers want authenticity. not hard to get right.,2
"food was delicious, with good customer service. food came soon after order with generous portions. will visit again.",4
"excellent, traditional malaysian food. you have a craving or just came back from malaysia want some good authentic food, then this is the place for you. the staff are very lovely, the food is amazing and the prices are very reasonable. be prepared to wait during busy times, the secret is out and tons of people want to eat here now.",5
"food is really delicious, i always go for the singapore laksa soup which is so filling. service is generally good and the prices are very good for the portions",4
authentic malaysian and singaporean food. got the approval of our fussy children too!!,5
the food was discasting,1
"while the prices here were about 5x the price in singapore, the taste of the chicken rice and char kuey teow reminded me of singapore! it was nice to have a taste of singapore food again, and i would eat the chicken rice here again! the har cheong gai was quite dry though... for me at least.",5
not sure if i ordered the wrong dish but the lor mee was underwhelming. broth had hardly much flavour and lacked any depth. dishes are fairly priced though. would re-visit to try other dishes.,3
"food was too bland despite requesting them to make it a little spicy. staff one of the waitresses wasnt very polite. girl who took the order was really helpful. i was asked to pay for extra peanut sauce for my chicken satay, i requested for it as it was really dry.",3
"nice, fast and quite cheap malaysian restaurant in chinatown. it has the maximum rate of food hygiene something to take into account as other places nearby they have a very low rate. nasi lemak didnt seem very authentic with curry chicken so i went for some noodles and they were nice. they have vegetarian options.",4
very lovely restaurant with nice staff.the food is not only very delicious but also very filling and friendly on the pocket.,5
pretty authentic curries for a malaysian restaurant in london,4
"bad service, rude staff and the foods was not really nice.",1
"great food, great value as ever",4
"the food is really bad by any standards. their signature dish (nasi lemak) - rice was undercooked, curry chicken was bland. do not order the orh jian (oyster omelette). it was awful. the marmite chicken wings were overly salty.  34 for 2 pax for 3 dishes with 2 teh o kosong (black tea with no sugar). bad bad bad. never to return.",1
nice halal chinese place. i'd recommend the me goring,4
"this place is fab. the food is excellent - we loved the fried carrot cake, the prawn mee, the sambar okra is delicious! highly recommend!!",5
"do not choose this restaurant for delivering food, if you taste the food on the restaurant is okay.but! but! if your order the food from their restaurant by deliveroo. it is the rubbish ! its the food totally out of the fresh !",1
"good customer service, clean environment and great food!!",4
"good service, great quality food at very reasonable prices just off shaftsbury avenue (near china town).lots of choice on the menu, tried a few things so far, and have liked all of it.recommended by a malaysian friend, and haven't regretted it since.",4
loved it great food fast service nice people.,5
really nice restaurant for authentic malaysian food. great for a family night out or a quick lunch. pricing is decent too.,5
great placw for peoper malaysian meals.,5
there's a lady called linda and she does my hair all the time. without a doubt she knows what she's doing. 5/5,5
good service ,4
delivers consistent haircut quality. recommended.,5
not the most fancy looking salon but had a quick and good haircut here. decent price too.,5
"very friendly and helpful hair dresser. gave some really good tips regarding my hair. of course, the hair cut was really good too!",5
"best japanese place i have visited so far in london. you have to wait sometimes a bit to get a table, and the service is not the fastest, but totally worth it! ",5
lovely food and so much attention to details. looking forward to coming back.,5
love the food! small place and always a guarantee queue but worth the wait. ,4
"their kinako bing su is great, recommended.",4
great place if you fancy shaved ice. best quality and not pricey at all.,5
delicious and unique snow balls texture!,5
i really like the bingsu here; it's the best dessert on the menu.,5
"the shaved ice desserts are amazing. a bit pricey but so tasty, and lots of different flavours to choose from! i recommend the matcha bing. ",5
"might take a long time for waiting but it's worth to wait. however, please remind that the restaurant close at 10.30 pm because sometime they might not mention you about the time of last order.",4
bit expensive but worth it! would only go for tea time and their shaved ice! their shaved ice is the best ive had in london yet,4
"the best place in london for japanese snowflake ice cream, but that's about it.",3
all about the shaved milk desserts!,4
"best dessert place i have visited so far! tried the strawberry, mango and matcha bing and my favorite is the mango one. everything is really fresh, and the shaved ice tastes creamy but fresh. recommend this to anyone who's looking for late night dessert as they open till 11pm. ",5
"chinatown's most famous bakery, they do sweet desserts as well as savoury buns. my personal favourite is the bbq pork bun which is only 1.30 each, 2 will fill you up for lunch and they are generously bursting with sweet char siu pork! best value thing in chinatown, definitely worth paying pilgrimage to! :d",5
the bingsoo here is the bomb.,5
"authentic and delicious food, great portion size and amazing deserts!",5
"normal chinese style dessert, actually they say it's japanese dessert. no service, but charged me service fees. i asked for the bill, but they told me go to the till and pay.",1
"nice service and cozy atmosphere for afternoon tea. it's very comfortable  to have a chat with friends and enjoy bingsu. on a slight negative note, i wished there could be less shaved ice and more strawberry on the strawberry bingsu.",4
"pretty place, reasonable price, amazing food and great service for a place so busy. will come back",5
honestly the best sushi i've tried in london and the people are soooo nice here . also the shaved ice i recommend the mango one  ,5
"been there for sushi as well as the desert. lovely sushi,but now my main reason for a visit is the shaved ice.",5
very nice ice flakes. not expensive. flavours get boring after a while though. price is adequate.,4
ive been here way too many times but by far the best bingsoo ive ever had,5
the bingsu was great. would come back to try the rest of the menu... and have more bingsu,5
"their desserts (the shaved ice and cakes) are out of this world. i highly recommend, although the place is a bit small so you may have to wait before getting seated. ",5
"nice service, hot waiters who almost melt the matcha bingsu haha must try the matcha bingsu really! and the soft shell crab roll four stars only because the waiters are kinda impatient to wait you to finish the food and almost wanna grab the food away whole we are still eating it.",4
"very good food and nice friendly service, i didn't give 5 because it is not impressive looking place at all",4
like the bing su,5
great bingsu and matcha swiss roll.,4
"waited for a table for about 10 minutes, asked to place an order beforehand and they took our order. fast forward 30 minutes of sitting in a cramped seating area we asked about our order and they told us desserts take awhile, but we later found out they never took our order. 1/10 would not pay for this ice again.",1
"slow service,  but the food is worth waiting for. ",4
best place in town if you're looking for a traditional chinese bakery.  they're freshly baked in store and they're everything is generously sized.,5
i always go for having dessert. the frozen milk flakes are delicious.,5
correct.,3
delicious desserts! pretty packed for a small place. if you come for dinner expect que!,5
"yummy chinese delicacies - especially love their chinese cookies. even though i have moved work base from holborn to tooting broadway, i still make a detour on way home at end of the week to get my fix of my favourites. ",3
i really loved this bingsu.. or in japanese: kaligri (shaved ice cream)! there were matcha and anko (read beans paste).. so tasty!!! even if it was a small one it was hard for me to finish it! i really recommend to share it with your friend or partner!,5
"i have been looking forward to go to this resturant for ages. the food is very traditional japanese, the set meun tgis is a unaju which is good with some real favor in it. the price is acceptable and the staff are welcoming.",5
the best mango bing in london!,5
the best bingzu in london but hard to accommodate many people for same table. ,4
nice food but small place (need to wait for seats!),4
the special bing dessert is probably one of the freshest and nicest desserts to be imported into london. very popular choice,5
"expensive, tiny portions of food and limited menu. one of the waiters kept on sneezing and wiping his runny nose while preparing food in our presence. tiny space, canteen atmosphere. there are plenty of much better restaurants nearby.",2
not so pleased with the service waitress was like not there our drinks came after we finished our food and it was just bottled waterthe sushi chef was not present so we did need to chose other foodoctopus was off had a bit of a trouble after this lunchdo not waste your time and money there is better places in soho,1
"always big queues, their milk snow deserts are good, but nothing special.",3
small place and a bit expensive but very well maintained and good service,4
"love th food and dessert served here. slightly small so the queue can be long, but if you need a table for 2 then it's usually quite fast. ",5
great cake and good prices (the fruit sponge is the best). their other stuff looks really nice as well but there's only so much one person can eat! ,5
very tasty! lots of unique and interesting dishes.,4
"expensive but tasty shaved (milk) ice. not to burst anyone's bubble, but the mango is not fresh but from a can of aroy-d mango. ",4
great bingsu: shaved ice milk. you can split a small (6) between 2 people; i recommend the mango. ,5
"wonderful place! wide range of shaved ice dessert and my favourite is azuki latte (japanese red bean), the only one star short is for waiting area too small and sometimes have to wait outside. but good thing is the staff won't force you to share table like other japanese restaurants do! :)",4
"they serve shaved ice which is a milky liquid that is frozen and shaved very finely that it resembles snow. the  one we had was made with strawberries and had japanese  strawberry short cake in its. the drinks here a good as well, gets busy and serving times are abit slow.",4
great place. long queue.,5
went here for my friends birthday and it was amazing! we had some edamame and sushi as starters and some delicious noodles! and of course some crushed ice after.. definitely worth all my money i spent! good job guys!,4
"a place where you can enjoy bingsu, or an ice flake dessert, originally from korea. would recommend you to start withtge strawberry one. you may also have japanese foods at the underground floor. but the queue for desserts is quite long and you might need to wait outside.",4
awesome place! sushis are good! everything looked so good and tasty on the menu! i could have got everything :)),5
shaved ice is yummy but how can they take 20mins to serve a bottle of beer and 25mins for 1 shaved ice after 9:30pm?,3
it was delicious though bit expensive.,4
great shows ice deserts,5
their saved ice desserts are amazing!!! both price and taste!! brought several of my friends here and they all loved it,4
ok you come here for the bing su - yummy!,4
great little place. quick and friendly service. lovely food about what you'd expect to pay in the area. could do with a little tlc to spruce the appearance a bit but enjoyed it a lot.,4
"this is not a real japanese restaurant. the japanese food in here was not good. on the other hand, the bing su in here are really good. so if you are looking for japanese food, this is not an option. but if you are looking for bing su, yes it's your place.",3
very nice food. especially love the bingsoo.  the service is excellent what makes it great so you always wanna return.,5
"the fluffiest snow ice i've ever tasted - get the kinkako (soy bean) with azuki option, you will not regret it.",5
excellent restaurant. visited japan a few times and this is a great reminder of the great food i ate there. highly recommend.,5
delicious bingsu and definitely worth your money as even a size small is enough to fill your belly!,5
"i came for the bing su desert was amazing, almost tried all their flavours",4
"good spot for dessert but it's always busy on weekends especially. you might have to queue for a bit to get a table. they have bingsoo (shaved ice) which i love and other selection of food, drinks and dessert",4
decent bingsoo,4
"i frequent this place for their bingsu. i recommend the matcha flavour but if you're not into that then the mango is superb as well. the rest of the food is average. four stars because the toilet is not very clean and it is very small, hardly any room to move.",4
the best bingsoo i've ever had is from here. highly recommend the kinako flavour! it's just a shame that it's so hard to get a seat here.,5
oh so heavenly milk bingsu! soft as powdered snow and melts on your tongue with a subtle sweetness. delicious! highly recommend the oreo bingsu and the ichigo (strawberry) bingsu. staff are efficient and polite.only thing to note are the long wait times due to small space in the shop. a must visit despite this!,5
best place for shaved ice dessert!!,5
great food and great service!,5
"usually come here for the bing dessert, only place in london with the snow ice machine, a must try! the curry udon is very good, but slightly overpriced. lots of customers every hour of day, you will always need to queue. service is slow/snow machine is slow.",4
good place although lacking a bit of character. the food is good but not memorable. the service is fast and pleasant.a little on the pricey side with regards to drinks.,4
went here for dessert. good place to go with friends. the bings were refreshing. ,4
very tasty!,5
"reasonable prices, very delicious bingsoo but the waiting is a bit long",4
normally full of people and need to queue. taste is good although a bit pricey. a place for both a full meal or dessert.,4
well i've only tried their dessert and have now been back twice!! it is brilliant thumbs up!!! definitely recommend.,5
a bit expensive but the food is amazing!!!!,4
always have something lovely to eat and drink here.lovely service too,5
one of the best japanese restaurant in london! very tasty food. excellent staff,4
"we went here for dessert, the shave ice was very refreshing, matcha roll cake was really nice too. i took one star off just because the place was a bit small and you might have to wait for a bit if you go with a group larger than 2.",4
it's absolutely a pathetic restaurant because the staff are flippin korean instead of japanese and the restaurant should be worked by people from their country's tradition.,1
"beautiful small restaurant, we ordered the classic red bean bingsu(classic one) and the mango bingsu. it was absolutely refreshing and was beautiful. this was the first time trying bingsu and i was not disappointed! it was so lovely and will be coming back soon, great customer service!",5
"i love it. one of my favourite restaurant london, when i'm hungry for japanese food. the food is lovely, the staff nice. some people just come for dessert, you have you try they special frozen milk dessert.",5
"one of the best japanese places i've ever been to. noisy and lively in the best possible way, with absolutely cracking food right in the heart of london.",5
definitely have to try their bingsu it's amazing!,5
"had a small shaved ice. i really love how fine the ice is and the kinako powder goes perfectly with it. even a small one was too much for me near the end, so perhaps sharing it between 2 would be alright.",4
"very good bingsu. we tried the matcha bingsu, mango bingsu, and chocolate oreo bingsu. the shaved ice tasted milky and the texture was amazing. would recommend!",5
love those snowy ice desserts.,4
the desserts they serve are something i would come back for. unfortunately my most recent visits have been less impressive than my first one. the attention to service provided has been appalling especially since there was only one other table when my group of friends came.,4
delicious and authentic japanese. save room for their desserts - i would recommend the kinako bing. the small is massive and can serve 2-3 after dinner. can get busy with a long line on friday evenings and weekends ,4
really yummy food just love it ,5
"great food, the bing su was much better than expected - a must trygreat quality sushi  - a bit pricey but would go again",5
great bing. the miso aubergine was also surprisingly good.,5
very nice food. good service.,5
i loved it!!!!!! it's such a great place for soups...you can chose a base...add toppings...it's a completely customisable order!!,5
"i had the best mango bing i have ever tasted. with generous proportions and a perfect balance of sweetness, it's filled with hidden mango pieces buried in the milk bing. highly recommended, not sure about the hot food tho.",5
small place but the desserts are good. bit pricey for what it is though.,4
"amazing place,  good food if you are open to try something new ",5
the food is delicious even though the waiting was  pretty long. a bit pricey. lovely staff,4
absolutely disgusting attitude. slow and rude. food took ages and when it arrived was not what we ordered. no apology nothing just a blank expression on her face. avoid at all costs.,1
matcha snow? it can't get any better!,5
"amazing place, everything is really fresh, tasty and really affordable",5
manga shaved ice is so refreshing i felt born again,5
snow was great but the sushi was below average. considering this is supposed to be a good japanese restaurant i expected better from the sushi. go for the snow but skip the sushi.,3
"the still water is amazing, the little slice of lemon is a nice touch, totally worth the 2.50. i'd give it 10 stars if i could!",5
too small and not that yummy,4
place is small. waitress tmd ccb hen l 7 rude,1
"very tasty, prices absolutely ok!",5
their icecreame is very good,5
delicious fun dessert! great bingsu flavours available!,4
"i love desserts and its definitely a good place to go. the left one is amazing. the mango one seems to be too sweet for mewell so is frappuccino of starbucks), though my friend disagrees with me.",5
berry good shaved ice thingies,5
loveable but very tiny japanese place. food is great. definitely try shaved ice if you have never had it.,5
delicious bingsu! a bit more fresh fruit would have hot the spot :),4
"amazing desserts! had the mango and the matcha kakigori. have not tried the hot food, but will definitely be back to give it a go.",5
"best bingsoo you can find in london! the flakes are milky and creamy, all ingredients are fresh!",5
quite small but dessert and food is absolutely amazing. however they charge service charge.,4
"great for shaved ice, good portion",5
"quite small and basic, but really good rice and delicious sashimi! quick service, friendly staff, great find near west end theatres",5
tho its been sometime... but i pass by here so often so i gotta say last time i was here was shocked by the mochis price and there was a small rat at the bottom floor.... :(,1
"the best japanese in all of london, so say everyone! incredible food, cute little venue.",5
staffs are very rude and bad attitude especially the guy at the front. the food quality has been dropping aswell for at least a year now. the food and desserts was very good a few years ago.,1
"love the strawberry, matcha and red bean bingsoo!",5
"cute as hell fluffy fat pancakes. not super sweet so didn't feel too naughty. not a big seating area, more like a bench so don't expect to spend too much time here. the fruit teas were also super interesting with loads of fruit and coconut jelly in. worth stopping by!",5
nice and cosy place. food was good too. not ideal if you're claustrophobic.,4
the shaved ice xuebing is great as always. what a nice place for desserts or afternoon drinks.,5
"shaved iced bingsoo is nice, place a little small but overall great.",5
"ichigo bing, came here for dessert and was delicious. will be coming here again during summer. was a bit disappointed a chef wasnt available to prepare parts of the menu but this dessert was very good",4
love the bingsu herethe espresso bingsu is stunning would have given this place 4 stars but unfortunately they always run out of the espresso bingsu! have not had one in my last 3 visits,3
absolutely a must visit place in soho. watch my video on youtube . soho london mominnz,5
good service but the most average sushi i have ever had:(,2
the perfect lunch break during our excursions around london.,5
authentic japanese. family loved the strawberry bing which we have tried for the first time. will definitely come back here next time we visit london.,5
"i have yet to try the food but i always come here for my favour shaved milk! very tasty and obviously cooling. its quite a big bowl so if you're not a big eater then you night consider to share, but if you're greedy like me then one each is always the best option!",4
amazing strawberry shaved ice (bing),5
"my favourite place in chinatown, especially for their shaved ice desserts and sushi!",5
food pretty good...service slow,3
"bingsu is cheap and so good!! they also do some cakes, which are as amazing",5
"best bingsu ever!!! (im from an asian country yet i feel the bingsu is one of the best) they dont just use ice for the bingsu. we tried the peach (momo) bingsu, and the peaches were very fresh and tasty. the interior is very cute and great for a chilled hang out.",5
cosy & good service,5
"very friendly waiting staff, tasty food arriving very quickly. four stars as it could you a little bit of interior design to bring out some more japanese character.",4
"only had the tempura udon but it was really top notch with both shrimp and vegetable tempura, so a great deal. the shaved ice looked great as well.",5
the matcha red bean bingsu was super delicious!,4
amazing small restaurant in soho with a homely feel. staff is very nice and is quick to tend to your service! selection isnt the biggest but isnt the smallest and i would reccomend anything on there as its amazing! definitely reccomend the bing su! can get quite busy so waiting takes around 10-15 mins,5
excellent tasty dishes (well at least for what i usually order ). very clean as well and polite staff. could do with more space for customers.,5

can't miss the bing ice cream,4
the food was really good,5

i really enjoyed the bingsu although their service was quite slow and the restaurant is write crammed. i would have preferred to have more layers though.,4
always & forever such a yummy place,5
surprisingly good sashimi and bingsu. my favourite hole in a wall but expect to queue at busy times. ,5
you must try the bing! it's unlike anything i've ever had. ,4
"amazing little cafe!the chawan mushi, sashimi salad and yuzu tea is my go to order, always makes me happya little pricy for china town, and it's quite small go in the daytime as it gets very busy in the eveningsperfect for casual dates ",4

"food no good, i shaving yes!",5
the shaved ice cream was really good. i had the or so one and it was amazing. the amount you get for the price you pay is good too. like there was alot of it.,5
ordered 1 bottle of beer & 1 dessert.the beer took 15 minutes and a complaint to arrive. the dessert took nearly 30 minutes.tasted ok but definitely not worth the wait. would not go there again or recommend.,1
i love bing su !,5
"small cozy japanese place, serving yummy desserts and also main dishes; only tried kakigoris and they were yummy. wished they had more toppings though!!!",4
was seated in the back which isnt the nicest area. sushi was alright.,3
"price is a little too high for me. food was great though. the hotate is *out of this world* and the shaved ice was surprisingly really good! very smooth, creamy and melty shaved ice.",4
very tasty ,5
amazing japanese food and ~,5
the bingsoo is so good here!,5

had good experience there,5
"great place for matcha red beans shaved ice, recommended if you have never tried before. the place is small but boutique",5
"a small restaurant with a cozy family vibe. friendly service and yummy food. i shared the momo (peach) bingsu with my gf and really appreciated the way the peaches, sauce and condensed milk were layered.",5
"amazing place for bingsu dessert, i have had all flavors except for oreo as i don't like to indulge in chocolate. best bingsu ever.",5
little tokyo in london!,5
we waited 25 minutes they served everyone else except us so we left unfortunately because we really wanted to try the ice cream white snow with strawberries ,1
very pricey yet very yummy. ,4
"this place is expensive af (i mean unagi for 35!!) but the food is good. the best part is the kakigori, if you dont have anything else, you need to try the kakigori ",5
"excellent japanese food in soho, one of many great japanese restaurants around soho, leicester square and shaftesbury avenue popular with students and theatre goers",5
"really nice milk ice-cream, the best i have had so far. there is a slight waiting time but the staff are very polite and there is a great atmosphere.",5
they do not providing authentic japanese cuisine i think. just a restaurant in jp style. and it is run by korean.my friend's beef don was very sweet in taste and my udon was too soft.,1
"my first time here, every single dish was amazing. will definitely go again",5
lovely food and bingsu ,5
amazing and big sized portions. worth to go,5
love the deserts there! the portions can be quite large when it comes to shaved ice cream. worth every penny.,5
nice interior but very very tight sitting. not cozy at all. the red beans toppings could be more. #duchessonfoot #fishfingerofficial,3
this place is soooo good!! the service is lovely and the food is delicious. try the scallops in the starters!,5
one of the best japanese restourant in soho!,5
try the bing su! pricey but fantastic and very cute atmosphere,5
it was my time having japanese dessert and it was amazing. i had  the oreo choco bing su. i was pleasantly surprised by the shaved ice with sweetened milk. we also true the matcha set and the red bean bingsu. all very impressive. they need to make their seating area more attractive though.,5
"amazing food, great taste and great quality, great service and great massive bills. all round a brilliant experience in a tiny little gem of a restaurant.",5
"a very well put together restaurant with great quality food and good service. the general atmosphere is relaxed and the food is reasonably priced. one improvement would be to have a wider selection of dishes to choose from, other than that the place is perfect for a lunch or dinner, alone or with company.",4
"narrowed supermarket selling chinese food and ingredients. sauce, instant noodle and preserves are in fairly good price but the frozen food does not. always a long queue.",1
"yes see woo! this place is great! the produce here is so fresh and the variety of products (they even sell cute china!) is impressive. i keep hoping i will run into fuschia dunlop here so cross your fingers for me. buy your wok here, and all the bok choy and chili bean paste to cook in it.",5
"a typical chinese supermarket in china town-a rich selection of chinese goods and not that good service. however, it should belong to the bests among its peers.",4
the best chinese supermarket in london. great selection,5
my family were go shopping for the chinese  supermarket while they were shopping for the food,5
"excellent chinese supermarket the heart of chinatown. they sell kitchen supplies downstairs too. by the way, it's the cheapest place to find a steel wok. ",5
awsome experience. many rare vegitables and chinese made products,5
"packed with a fantastic array of good chinese household food brands and some homeware items. perfect for stocking up on hotpots, teas, sweets and frozen meats. has narrow aisles and can get very busy. try to visit during less busy hours using the google busy chart in google maps. ",4
great selection of chinese fare.  clean store.  very popular with tourists and locals.,4
"great place for asian groceries...  shame you have to spend more than 10 if you're paying by car (although,  they have a little hide corner at the end of the shop with the cheapest oysters i've ever found in london,  0,70 each)",4
note : no card payment under 10. decent supermarket so long as you know exactly what you are buying and where to find it. asking for help when in a rush was hopeless :),3
"often very crowded, this supermarket in the heart of london's chinatown stocks many different chinese and asian grocery products. if you are interested in oriental cooking, this is definitely a place you want to visit.",4
better stocked and cleaner than other supermarkets in chinatown. quality products at decent prices. ,5
"great range of asian food products on offer. note, cash only for purchases 10 or under.",5
very good selection of chinese stuff n they are slightly cheaper than other supermarket ,5
great prices and have a ton of products and brand names - easily one of the best chinese supermarkets in central london. look out for the fresh fruit!,5
great little store with all the supplies you could want.  the frozen seafood is amazing value.  always busy. ,5
"good place for oriental food, some things are cheaper then wingyip",4
happy to shop there.,4
surprisingly comprehensive asian shop. broad range of frozen dumplings and seafood.,5
not the biggest oriental shops around but they have the best selection in my opinion,5
"variety of food, some fresh vegetables, yet rude staff, no matter how good the food is, never going to buy from there again. they are big supplier and big business anyway. they don't care.",2
"of all the supermarkets in chinatown, it's the best for frozen meats and vegetables. their frozen dumplings also tend to be the cheapest and most flavourful. canned goods however tend largely to have dents in them, so choose carefully. deliveries come in at all hours of the day, so try not to linger by the doors just in case. ",3
good place for chinese shopping.,4
clean and tidy environment. cashiers are not friendly though.,4
i love it. they sell beautiful cups and everything i'm gonna go there again. is a fantastic shop,5
"it's a good place to get specialist oriental ingredients and utensils. the new seafood extension is good - even if it did mean the loss of mr kong, which was the best restaurant in chinatown",3
its ok,3
"great selection of chinese food crammed in this shop. you will certainly find what you are looking for but you will continuously find that you are in the way.if you are in china town, well worth the visit, even if you are not there to buy anything.",4
"got good selection of asian food, home stuff, fishmonger and butcher's. i think this is by far the best chinese supermarket in chinatown. always crowded with long queues though.",5
"fresh,chilled&frozen asian supermarket.",5
good asian supermarket. great selection. staff a bit touch and go but that's china town for you. ,4
get asian things here,5
your usual chinese supermarket- lots of stuff packed in one small area. good selection of stuff from asia,4
"my favourite of the chinese supermarkets in london. usually come here to buy chinese greens, sauces, interesting mock meats, and other odds and ends. aisles are a bit cramped and the staff aren't always the most charismatic but i enjoy my visits here nonetheless.",4
excellent alternative to its competitors on gerrard st. as the aisles are much wider and it's much less crowded so you don't feel anxious.,5
good chinese supermarket.,5
they have some chinese vegs that are rare in england. a great selection of sauces too. ,5
"friendlier staff compared to the other competing chinese supermarket one street away ;-) and less crowding too, with fresher fresh produce.",4
"efficient and well stocked supermarket run by chinese people with a great range of vegetables, fruits, cooking sauces, seasoning and frozen food from mainly china/hong kong but also from other parts of asia e.g. thailand. there is also a basement where they sell non-food items e.g. crockery and art & crafts.",4
very good range of products but always so busy and long queues - quite stressful!,4
this is without doubt the best asian supermarket in europe.,5
haven't found a better chinese supermarket in london yet!,5
great range. especially seafood,5
"chineese, korean, japanese foods in good price.",4
"fresh vegetable cheaper thia kau choi (chinese chives ), best frozen fish ball, careful with children very crowded difficult to move in the shop",3
great range of items and quick service at checkout. ,5
had everything i was looking for even if not the easiest to navigate.,5
"absolutely rubbish, rude staff! awful food",1
good quality chinese supermarket with some other kitchen utensils for sale.,4
excellent food store. good prices. ,5
very well stocked,5
one of the better organised groceries in china town. some items on the butcher's counter were alarmingly low-priced...,4
expect a few of the typical chinatown clichs such as brusque service but see woo is still one of the best places to get oriental foods and ingredients. in recent years has expanded out of the original chinese goods to cover most areas of the far east too,4
" good range,  decent prices.  shop floor staff appear to consist of manual labourers and couldn't help find items.",4
this supermarket has recently added some fish tanks for fresh seafoods.,4
"needed wonton sheets ... and they had them. if you are into cooking oriental foods, this is the place to buy.",4
go here when i am in the chinatown area to pick up oriental groceries and sauces such as noodles and oyster sauce & chilli oil.  typically rude staff. most of the stuff can be bought in local supermarkets or amazon so the rude staff can be avoided. ,2
come here for their huge range of chinese meatballs - really the only place i've been able to source proper beef tendon balls in london,5
"located at the heart of london's chinatown, it is a great place to buy asian groceries and products.",5
good selection of asian goods.  now with a butcher and fresh seafood section.  ,4
find all asian food here! all kind of instant ramen from thai to korea!,4
for a small seewo . it has everything you need for a authentic chinese recipe,5
great selection of genuine chinese products and fresh meat & fish. ,4
clean and well organize supermarket in soho. live seafood available...,4
here have fresh meat and seafoods. nice quality dried shitaki mushroom. good service.,5
good range of authentic chinese foods.,3
bit overcrowded but plenty stuff to choose from. fast checkout,4
"decent prices, have most stuff, however very cramped",4
"for such a small chinese supermarket, this place is always incredibly well stocked with lots of diverse offerings.",4
always found the general chinese & special oriental delicacies needed in see woo. friendly & helpful staff. cashier queue may be long but it is a sign that they are popular with chinese & western customers.,5
great place for asian stuff!,5
great location. the price is higher and less food selections then the store in wembley,3
"very chinese style, staff wasn't helpful at all,but variety choice of korean, japanese and china with private butcher too. price is market price not feel any special. purchase frozen food did not provide double bag, actually, i haven't been offer any bags. chinese supermarket smell full of the environment, feel like return china.",3
"wide variety of food from asia and also fresh sea food, fish and meat. great selection of frozen dumplings. it's a clean place and price is quite reasonable. i'd say it's the best supermarket in china town. ",5
great fresh fish,5
"love this place, my favourite chinese supermarket, it's a bit small, but store is always quite tidy, products are fresh and priced reasonably. i love their fresh seafood counter.  always come here if i am in the neighbourhood to buy some seafood.",5
a repeat customer for over 20 years.still the best for all my shopping needs.maybe loyalty cards in the near future.,5

good place,5
great choice,4
always fresh and perfect!,5
affordable far eastern foods.,5
"nice little chinese supermarket, the lowest price in china  town.",4
"any food from china and southeast asia is possible to find here. there is a butchers area and a fishmonger the fish is fresh, really fresh. as it should be. there is a downstair area for pans and pots, obviously asian ones. the prices a bit higher compared with out of central london places but still the range is huge so it is quite ok.",5
very nice food,4
very crowded and there is always a long checkout line.,3
best supermarket for fresh ingredients. well organised and run.,5
"offer everything you need for asian ingredients, fresh vegetables but small aisle to walk around",4
"business as usual,  they had every thing i wanted,  especially there greens and fish tofu cubes.  is good place to source different types of dietary requirements.",5
the fish and seafood is amazing and well-priced.,4
the range of goods is really satisfying as well as the pricing. they even have pastries and a meat section.,5
i think it is the largest chinese supermarket in this china town. i go there almost twice a month. i love vegetables and fruits here. it's fresh and high quality!,5
great store!,5
"busy but great shop for fresh meat and seafood. price wise i am not sure if its better or worse than its neighbour loong fung, but for the one-shop shopping experience you cant beat this place. i love the skin on pork belly for 2. often i find one for 3.5!!! where in the world can you find something so fresh but so cheap?",4
"a bit crammed as there is not much floor space, on the positive, very centrally located, reasonable prices and pretty good choice for the size of the shop",4
"the prices is okay,  avoid night time and you will be fine.",3
always go there when in london.  it's where the.local community shops. you can get all you need to make any oriental meal,5
you can pretty much find everything you need for your home cooking. sometimes there may be long queue due to bulk buying from chinese takeaway shops.,4
one of the most comprehensive range of asian food suppliers.  you may find everything you need for preparation of your asian dishes. expect long queue at peak hours.,4
great supermarket in chinatown. has all the standard groceries items at reasonable prices. the shop also has a fishmonger as well as a large selection of cookware in the basement.,4
great range of stock lots more than other stores in china town.  well worth a visit!,5
one of my favorite asian supermarkets in london. the place is tidy and not as crowded  as long fung. the vegetables here are in good quality at a reasonable price. there are also exotic fruits from thailand and china.,5
i'm so happy with service x,5
"if you are a durian lover you should come to seewoo, i normally buy the frozen one in the supermarket but surprisingly they have the fresh one there.",4
long established grocery shop specialising in oriental goods,4
"came home to see items out of date. either lazy or deceptive. it's not popular, it's just cramped and narrow with a slow check out.",2
"a really good supermarket and kitchen shop, very reasonable prices and good quality stuff.",4
authentic chinese products! but very crowded inside,4
"busy most of the time, this is my all time chinese grocery store in london. plenty of choices. they sell fresh seafood and meats.",5
always too busy but carries basic needs of brands and groceries from china. don't expect much variety of other east asian groceries.,4
good spot to find real thai and chinese food ingredients,4
"awesome experience for novel, healthy foods from far and wide. good lunch options too. a little pricey but for good quality items.",5
"very good fresh produce including lots of imported greenery, fresh components for home cooking! lots of oriental frozen options, sauces, spices, dim san, etc. in the hidden basement you have a large availability of cooking wares and utensils.",4
the best asian supermarket,5
"really good asian grocer in chinatown - they have most asian ingredients you need, but the main reason i go here is the fresh/live seafood! it's perfect if you're looking for pomfret, live flower crabs, tiger prawns, and even mussels and cockles. the prices are very reasonable too!",5
asian grocery which pretty much has everything! there is even a butcher further inside. so many snacks and frozen food. caters for every asian cravings.,5
"decent supermarket that fills most of your chinese food needs. their frozen section is decent and they have some of the more unusual items. being on the back street of chinatown means that they're often less busy than the other two supermarkets. the fresh fish section is great, something not available at the other two either.",4
"this is a little oasis hidden just outside the touristy part of china town. full of the most wonderful goods, this is a must if you cook asian food. freezer cabinets full too so if you want anything make sure you have a cool bag. ",5
nice china supermarket,5
its very busy here but prices are lower than most chinese supermarkets around. staff are quite rude though and push you out the way.,3
good amount of choice,4
"amazing prices and selection of goods, definitely a place to go if you like cooking and you're in chinatown",5
good asia groceries store but limited tolls which sometimes caused a long queue,4
need food inspection and rude staff who talked bad things in front of my face in chinese.the guy is floor manager in greenwich..he needs to be educated service mind.,1
"good range of products....friendly staff, even though not everybody speaks good english, they will help you if you have any questions.",5
good place for shopping,5
if you enjoy eating and buying asian foods then you can go thereyou will find all most everything with specific asian,5
great little supermarket with friendly staff.,5
great oriental supermarket,4
new fresh meat section is excellent. fresh veg section is excellent with labels indicating origin of veg. bit lacking in frozen and grocery section due to size of shop compared to some others but meat and veg are top in chinatown,4

wide variety of asian food at reasonable prices. i would say even cheaper than it's competitor on the other street on most items. the fresh seafood section is a great new addition to the store too. the corridors are a bit cramped though. ,4

small aisles crammed full of east asian groceries. there's some bargains such as noodles and tofu but other items like sesame oil are more expensive than a regular supermarket,4
best place for korean food in london.,5
"big choice of chinese food,  affordable prices ",5
a lot of chinese products you can purchase. some stuff you can buy which you cannot buy from some other chinese shops,4
great place for chinese groceries.,5
long queue. sub par manners from staff,3
lots of oriental food and ingredient,4
"great selections of fresh greens, mushrooms and other vegs.  staff is friendly and always gives me calendar and red pockets for new years.",4
weirdest food ever at great place.,5
the meat and fish counters are especially good,4
fresh seafood section is great,5
went nuts and spent too much money on ramen bowls and food.,5
long queue but good products,4
"great products at great prices ....the dim sums ...the raw prawns ....the sauces etc , all great !!!...the people behind the till could be a bit more courteous tho !!!",5
real nice food,5
"good selection, but always crowded",4
good chinese supermarket always busy,4
best sea food i've found so far,5
love the fresh meat counter!,4
i wish they did deliveries,4
great selection of asian groceries. service is a bit weird. ,4
great range of asian cooking needs ,5
good variety of fresh seafood.,5
the cashier allowed people from their country to jump the queue at the till. i was on the queue to till 5. and the cashier ended up treating me rude too! she literally just threw the changes to me,1
"good prices, variety products.",5
a good chinese supermarket.,4
"doesn't accept authority credit card. other kind of credit card is ok, but you have to spend more than 10.",2
good chineese shop,4
lot's of asian foodstuff. a bit crowded.,3
i had the shroom burger and my partner had the double burger with fries and a chocolate milkshake. we thought we would try it since its not located where we live. it was very delicious.,5
great food and fantastic customer service.,5
looked a quiet busy but the line was fast,4
"there were quite a few people sleeping in the booths and at the tables, no staff we around to help attempt to find a seat for us, we ended up going to five guys down the road, it's a pity as this was my first look at shake shack and i was hugely disappointed.",1
pricey but damn thats a good burger,4
nice hot food serve in big portion in the middle of leicester place.,5
can't go wrong with shake shack. service was fast and friendly. this location is busy but they pull through. lots of seating area on first and second floor with views of the square.can be a bit pricy and it's often not too filling but the quality is among the best.,5
good food but very bud organised,2
love the food at shake shack maybe this branch is a bit too crowded all the time though and the food is pricey but if you want an amazing fast food burger this one is among the best,4
"loved the cheesy fries and you can use unidays here to get a free chicken burger, love that",5
it was very nice meal and deliciousthank you!! from south korea..+ clean toilet,5
fastish food. overpriced. small portions.  other choices in the area offer better value for money.  better tasting burgers.,3
"decent but small burger. cheese fries a pathetic excuse for a side. lukewarm with a lump of lukewarm, tasteless sauce on them. had clearly been sitting out waiting for the burger to be ready. not cheap either. better taste, better value in somewhere like byron or five guys",2
"really expensive,  no shakes (it was about 2 in the morning), and i had to queue for ages up spend my 10.75 for a burger. on the upside,  it came quickly, and it tasted really nice.",3
good burgers and cool fries! just expensive because of location in my opinion.,4
"queues, confusion. to compact burgers. soggy fries.  sausage was cold but to long queues to complain. broken soap dispenser on toilet with exposed wires.",2
"food tasted good. that's where the positives end. tables were dirty, ketchup machine was broken and the drinks were flat. it's a fast food set up but without the fast food prices or anything else synonymous with fast.",3
"staff are so rude and zero knowledge of what gluten free is, plz educate your staff before you kill a customer",1
it was really the best hamburger i ever eat,5
pretty busy but the food is delicious. wait time is around 15 minutes,4
small portions but decent burgers. nothing wow about it.,3
"i like the service, and the choice. i chose a freshly made lemonade that was very nice. the seating availablity is great, as there is an upstairs for dining too. for a large group, it is a good option.",4
double size concrete was huge! and had a cone on top. amazing value,5
"great place, good food, however i remove a star cos the shaker to call when you food is ready didn't work, waited ages to end up with cold burgers ..",4
the chicken burger is very mediocre... kfc does a better job with it's zinger,2
fantastic customer service! or at least when i went there my guy was really efficient and polite!,5
precooked but still delicious,4
"the restaurant is really good, the location is perfect, the staff are so friendly, and the food is good",4
quite expensive for the quality,4
not many places to sit but good food,4
very nice service! thank you!,5
burgers are just phenomenal  fries are great and the lemonade is super,5
just a burger...,3
"delicious, crowded (in a nice way unless you hate being around people), and an awesome location.",5
smart excellent cheeseburger and vanilla shake!always copied never surpassed,5
very beatiful and the meal delicious,4
great place ,5
shake shack never disappoints!,5
muito bom e com preos razoveis.,5
a very nice burger. delicious.,5
nice burgers and fries,4
worst branch which i visited.,1
godd,4
pour une premire fois agrablement surprise  refaire trs sympa,4
whats not to like in a place that is open until 3 am... serve u freshly made fries and burgers and always deliver... nothing special just good old junk food for the masses.... the shake shacks in the us serves better meat but its a matter of taste i guess....,4
compared to the covent garden branch this place is not good. over 15 minutes to get food. fries were cold. by the time the last person of a group of 3 got their food the 1st had finished theirs. seemed to be catering more for deliveries then in house.,2
"christmas shake was rubbish, the choco-block was bad as well,only reason why i gave 2 stars was because the customer service was good.",2
"bad bad bad. small portions, expensive, soggy bun, tough bacon, no flavor. cheese fries limp, cheese sauce cheap canned product. not impressed.",1
very surprised...wonderful chicken sandwich...great spicy treat,4
i loved their peanut butter milkshake. the rest of the family all loved their different shakes. great service. clean loo and premises.,5
"simple, tasty and amazing.we order the original with regular fries and the seasonal fries with garlic mayo. after a while the garlic tastes a bit too much, so take this fries only if you are super into garlic. the burger has the perfect size and the whole experience is great.",5
yum burgers! you've got to eat them with a milkshake ,4
"i've tried the burgers and dogs, they're okay. what annoys me is that on every ocassion they mess up if it's a stay in or take away. i've always had to ask that my order be packed even though the receipt cleary says 'take away'.",4
loooove the burger...tasty,5
nothing special. expensive fast food but expected because of the location,3
tasty food long que ..,5
"service is decent and you are served quickly regardless of it being busy. food tasted good , just need more of a halal menu in this branch like the one in dubai. currently oy the chicken burger is halal. please dont be put off at the size of the burger as they are very filling and worth the money.",4
very bad quality  for that price,1
1 of the most friendliest staff i ever seen as late as the time we visited. from the lady who took our order to the floor and tables cleaner.,4
it was good. staff were friendly but i prefer the one in the usa. it had a better taste to it and the staff were much more friendlier also in stress. i personally wouldnt go back to the one in the uk as its very much a touristic place to eat and the quality isnt 100% the best,3
overpriced,3
yum.,4
delicious !!!,5
great burger wow,5
the best,5
"the food seemed to be better in the past, however it's still good. but it's always very crowded",3
the best cips ever,5
the security staff think its a top nightclub in the west end and are very rudei saw at least 3 incidents with rude security whilst waiting to be servedmy family will not be going there again,1
bom para quem gosta de hambrgueres,4
a really bad one...,1
my favourite,5
really good food. however very small portions for the amount of money you spent there.,4
this is a bad experience. i ordered meister shack and fries. the burger's meat tasted very dry and overcooked. don't come here and try anything.,1
preos bem elevados e a qualidade deixa a desejar. mas valeu para conhecer.,5
pensa num lanche gostoso,5
"small burger, good portion frise.",3
so great,5
"super greasy, not for me",3
very good milkshake!,5
great place for burgers..,5
very good burger.,5
big mess all around,2
dirty,2
"this place is actually really cool, but too expensive for what it is and the burgers are so soggy....",3
best burger around ,5
an unexpectedly good burger and fries. the portion is big as well. i recommend this place if you fancy a burger.,5
"very nice food, good service , the employees are polite and well organized...but there was no cleaning papers",4
food was very good. the queueing system and food collection is organised chaos but the staff can't be blamed for that as it's the customers causing the issues,4
"cold. and really not good.. shake shack used to be my go to, five guys are so much better in the uk.",1
good place for a quick and delicious burger. my family had a pleasant time,4
"seemed very disorganised, and some of the staff were clearly getting agitated with impatient customers. i don't think an open kitchen is wise given the location of this site is in an extremely busy area, but that's just my opinion. our food was clearly rushed and thrown together haphazardly, and over priced considering the portion sizes.",2
"the food is really tasty. like the idea of getting the menu on the entrance, however i waited for my food approx. 20mins and laides didn't work so i'm giving it 3 stars...",3
very busy but as usual better that 5 guys in my opinion,5
"great food as always, way too busy though.",4
"tasty burger, really nice, right up there with the better burger joints... but just didn't warrant the wait or price, especially given the size of the burger.",4
i enjoyed shake shack burger and their truffle fries,4
"nice, quite busy though, but that is to be expected based on the location",4
"food very nice, staffs were very friendly, helpful & accommodating...",5
don't always have everything available but - can't go wrong with shakeshack. gets understandably busy but never had a hellish wait in there.,4
so busy hardly place to sit.. considering what they are charging i want to eat in peace and enjoy it rather than keep getting looks by other customers who are waiting for people to vacate the seats so they can sit.,3
"visited the shake shack and i am glad i did, the burger was nice, soft, juicy and tasty it was cooked well. the fries was also nice and crispy with that sauce on top. only problem is they don't have it back home in sydney.",5
loved cheesy fries. only chicken is halal. good customer service too.,5
our go to burger bar when in town...well worth the extra few quid.,5
"the burgers are tasty, but fairly small for the price tbh",4
"great restaurant, very friendly and open staff and, most importantly, really good food.",5
i don't know why but i feel that ss at leicester is way superior than the one in covent garden and mansion house. the patty is more crispy and overall the burger feels more fresh.,5
nice.  a bit busy.  lots of seating space upstairs.   the entrance and the queue is a bit messy.  staff want to serve quickly and not recommend what to eat.   felt rushed.. but food was nice.  not as good as in the past but i prefer the covent garden ... smaller version.,4
"food was ok, nothing special. had to wait an age to get the food. seating area was fine, only one cubicle in the gents bathroom is mind boggling for such a busy area. no toilet paper in the stall either (only realised when needed), pure luck that i'd a few packets of tissue in my day sack.",2
best burgers hands down,5
pretty good actually. not expected for a burger restaurant in a touristic area in central london. they serve halal chicken as well and the cheesy fries were awesome. it's much better than any other burger i tried in london,4
"not a very good experience, the burger was pretty small and for the price it isn't a good value. the fries size was okay but those were pretty cold, please make sure you serve warm food! i think for the money you could get better value somewhere else!",2
"terrible on many levels, food is basic and doesnt stand out from other fast foods, staff was disorganised and it took ages to get our order. i dont understand all the fuss about this place.",1
"considering it was busy, they managed to organise the queue pretty quick with the buzzers notifications.  food was okay",4
"strawberry cookies and cream shake was just a lot of whipped cream and a boring liquid strawberry shake. not thick, luscious and rich. bits of cookies were crunchy but could do with bigger chunks.",2
"hi, i had a burger yesterday and it was lovely and testy,the service its so welcoming and friendly specially the girl who took my order was smiling all the time well done guys hope to keep it this way!! many thanks",5
"i love the chicken in my burger, it's flavourful and not dried at all despite the fact that it's breast part.",4
"my son loved it! excellent shakes and burgers. the frozen custard ""concrete"" is worth a try. i loved my masked vanilla milkshake.",5
they've taken the fast food concept of others and mucked it up.,2
the burgers are delicious but the place is crowded at night,4
burnt burger meat. forgot the tomatoes/pickles/salad for my double cheesburger. cold fries. will not return.,1
love shake shack! a bit busy since its central but good fast food.,5
"fairly busy at leics sq. even at about 11pm on a friday night. tasty burgers though. worth the c20min wait from queue to getting food. love the beef patties, bacon is dee-lish. not massively filling though is the only small complaint. at 13 for two bacon cheeseburgers - bit steep!",4
"its basic. had shake and custard and its basic. nothing above the fast food standard, nothing to talk about.",3
"while the food is good, you probably won't even get it. they take so long to deliver your order that people are rioting at the front of the queue, just to be received by incompetent and apathetic staff. avoid this place unless you're happy waiting >30m for your burgers.",1
very tasty. the shroom burger was really nice. original fries. it isn't cheap but it offers a superior quality and all the cooks wear gloves when making burgers and preparing food which is very nice too.,5
"first time at a shake shack.  absolutely loved the burger.  well cooked, not dripping in grease.  good texture and flavour.  the concrete was interesting, but not my thing.  too cloying.",4
fantastic food. the burgers and chips must be tried. i first visited this place as my daughter said how good it was. deserved 5 stars,5
the food is good but this place is always crazy busy. they are not very fast either. the 5 guys down the street is faster and better quality. if choose that over this shake shack.,3
extremely poor. food is unacceptable consider the price you pay. one thin single burger with a slither of bacon 10. small handful and chips with melted burger cheese 4. well know fast food chanes are much better and half the price. the staff where very friendly,1
absolutely delicious. the best shake shack in london town! i love the crispy crinkly chips. great staff too. ,5
"fries was warm but not hot enough to be enjoyed. the shackmeister ale was watered down. staff didn't seem to thrilled to be working. might have just been an off evening as it was pretty busy. but, for my first time visiting this place, it wasn't the best experience.",2
"if you're really hungry and don't have a lot of time, i guess you can go... too expensive for fast food and the food is really nothing special. they're plenty other fast food places around, some with better shakes, better burgers, and cheeper. i still eat sometimes here..",3
"enjoys the smoke shack, spicy with tasty bacon, and fries!decent prices, friendly staff and good quality food. will stop over again!",5
"everything you expect from shake shack: burgers are consistent and always great, the tiramisu shake was honestly amazing as well. i just miss the shake options they had in the us, like peanut butter. other than that its still my favorite burger joint and it was great to see one in london as well",5
"ive tried ss in washington dc, new york and singapore. im very surprised the burger here is so salty and the texture of the patty is too hard. it doesnt taste good. there must be something wrong in your process.",3
"we waited too long between the order and the arrival of the dish. also, i found it very expensive for a burger and fries. but, it tasted good. big thanks to the waiter who was cleaning the tables, he was very welcoming!",3
"very friendly staff (reception, counter and cleaning staff). black truffle fries were amazing. burgers were pretty average though.",5
regular haunt of mine - relaxing environment and good food.,5
just left -the table waiter was so rude and when he did clear and wipe the table he wiped the food onto our laps.terrible service and another couple left as we did for the same reason complained to the manageress .,1
"i book the table for my birthday for having food and drinks , the aperolspritz was simply water and they told me that they run out with food on friday night .was really bad",1
"shows the football, very spacious, standard london prices",4
"go on a monday, half price food and 2 for 1 cocktails, we had two 10oz ribeye steaks with sauce, extra sweet potato fries and 2 cocktails for 27 quid. and the steaks were even good too",4
"drinks good, food rubbish",3
awesome happy hour. 2 for specials!!! good drinks menu!,4
good food; not great food. more of a pub than a restaurant.,4
in general good place but i wouldn't recommended it.... expensive beer and the staff behind the bar is very ignorant!!!go to green man!,4
rubbish food very below standard for slug and lettuce chain,1
a very comfortable place to drink a beer after tennis game,4
it's alright. decent pint in a fairly sterile atmosphere. a woman told to choke on my own sperm but i can't really blame the venue for that... ,4
"extremely slow service. menu doesn't represent what is available. not good music. maybe overpriced, but i cannot drink what i initially asked for, so i don't know.",1
"service was diabolical, 40 min wait for food, waited an hour, then was told it was just being plated up, that took another 40 min only for children's food to be wrong, did give us a refund but the place wasn't even busy.",1
i love the choice of cocktails and 2 for 1 makes it even better. lovely food too. ,4
if you like slug on your lettuce,4
middle of leicester square but closes at midnight on a saturday? weird place.,3
felt a bit shabby. unbothered staff and lack of seating.,1
"great service, had a birthday booking here in september",5
"food and drinks spot on, male bar man dam rude.",3
good service and polite staff but not a large amount of seats unfortunately. they do have more upstairs but it's not always open so call ahead of you have a large party and don't want to be disappointed. they have a great selection of drinks and their food is pretty good as well.,4
busy but good location. food ok. service was above average but it felt impersonal overall.,4
nice comfy cozy place good atmosphere. very near to a lot of the west end.,5
"great food, young enthusiastic team and excellent cocktail menu!",5
"off the beaten track so usually able to get a table. otherwise, same as all the others in the chain.",4
nice restaurant / pub with great selection of cocktails. unfortunately they don't have ales and a/c we quite to heavy,4
"chilled out pub, great place to rest your feet from all the walking.",4
great cocktails,4
busy lively reasnobly priced 4 the west end but b aware they charged us 5 (sat night) 4 entry dont know if this is company policy,4
"sweet atmosphere, but watch out; they'll sell you drinks right until they throw you out because it's closing time. good place to visit if you leave before they shut down for the night.",2
"friendly staff, good food",4
"you should put the music volume much higher. you cannot talk with your friends when you dine there, the music is too loud. the dining room is not isolated from the pub. otherwise, the pub is okay, they have various range of beer",3
great meeting/starting point for a night on the tiles,4
ok.,1
"bad drinks, bad food, worse service.",1
great place to get a quick bite and beer. it does get busy.... just means its a great place.,5
"really poor service, tables not cleaned!",1
"not great, the cocktails taste weird and not very alcoholic. the bar staff not overly friendly either",2
"decent city centre pub.  lots of telly, decent beers, lovely food.  don't tell too many people, or it'll get even more popular ",4
busy pub good beer good for watching sport but need to get in there early,4
great food and service!,5
the batista with the crossed blue shirt do not give a good image of the place as is not really open to people... maybe the wrong day...,1
"we went for dinner at this place, the food was great and cocktails were faboulous , the staff were friendly and great at their suggestions of drinks, bledi was the bartender we got served from and we loved our visit to bits, highly recommended ",5
liked cocktails,4
"good to grab a drink, just off the busy high street and we'll priced.",4
"loud music, no table service. on a plus side 2 4 1 cocktails.",3
"good food, but weak beer choice.",4
well...it can be crowded considering where its located,4
took a long time to get a pint. staff looked stressed. not their fault.,1
great atmosphere,4
absolutely rammed no chance of getting anywhere near the bar the entire area is just packed with tourists,2
great place and do 2 for 1 cocktails. ,5
cocktails  2 4 1 . 4 to 9pm mmmm,4
good good reasonable prices has a kids menu,4
busy fairly average chain pub. would recommend for a cheapish drink for a very central location.,3
"great if you want to come for drinks, but they often mix up the food orders. ",3
go somewhere else if you can,1
"always great to visit, great choice of drinks, cocktails and food is fab.",4
awright,3
love it!,5
average wetherspoons.,3
great food and atmosphere,4
"food was lovely, and very fast service! however, i could not say the same about the drinks. we were repeatedly told they had run out of various elements of each desired cocktail, when we could see other customers around us had the exact same drinks we asked for! just seems like the staff couldnt be bothered.",2
super!,5
okay for cocktails and dance,5
"nice lively place. enjoyed a few visits here in the past. bags searched on way in too , cant say i blame them! thank you for a lovely visit or 2 xx",4
bar staff didnt seem to care who was next in line and took us forever to get served,3
excellent place to eat,5

nice little pub,4
great great place food and drinks have a wide sellection which is nice and in the bathroom which downstaires which is really nice and clean and has a worker down there just to make sure you safe and everything great place bad thing its a bit more expensive than expected,5
definitely an amazing slug!! i've been to several but this one is something else!!!,5
one of the better pub chains,5
plenty of vibe.,5
nice pub. we usually hire a functioning room for company meetings,3
"slow service,  but competent bar staff. its central london in the theatre district / china town, so it will always be busy.",3
clean & tidy with some good offers...  pleasant experience and recommend!,5
"friendly atmosphere, decent priced drinks and food.clean and can be energetic.",4

staff very good food terrible got a refund on one meal,1
nice staff very quirky,4

fantastic place. great meeting place for everyone,5
had a beautiful meal here though it was a friday night and very busy!,5
great place to hang out in the west end ! ,4
slowest service in the world ever!!,1
very accommodating to 18 young men and 1 young woman on their xmas drink.,4
good atmosphere...busy..owing to location and time of course but still able to get a seat !,4
most food was not available. weird generator noise heard and felt where we were sitting. took ages for the food to arrive. quite cheap.,2
good drinks it's a bit pricey and small not enough seating areas but still pretty decent place for drinks,4
great time,5
"poor choice of beer (no real ale), slow bar service and unfriendly staff. on the plus side, food came quickly.",2
the steak sandwich is great.,4
decent cocktails. good prices for london. not too busy!,4
good food and drinks shame about the arsenal game,4
great pace in a great place,5

a girly but clean and friendly bar,4
lost our food order. service very slap dash generally. not a good day for them!,1
"service is very slow. i have already been served flat amstel. so changed to peroni. no apology. busy place but if you  running a business as a chain shouldn't be happening. last few i have been within 5 months, i would just give them a minimum of 2 rating.",2
"it was good. it's not a typical service, you have to go to them an order once you are seated. great prices",4
"horrible service where the staff don't speak nor understand english. got our order wrong and my partner had to eat on his own and they brought me the desert before he even started eating his main! the excuse?! ""oh the girl at the bar is new"" no, my lovely she ain't speak english! would never ever again visit that place.",1
"kind of small. if only the downstairs is open only around 50 people can sit and there's no bar seats. staff are nice though, service with a smile. clean toilets too, i'd go back",3
rude bouncers - not pleasant. pushed me from the line when i hadn't had a single drink and insisted i did. aviod.,1
food not great quality and long wait at the bar,2
food was ready in a prompt manner.staff very polite. good selection of food and drinks. not bad priced although thought the mini beef sliders were expensive at 14 for 7 mini burgers,5
staff are a bit miserable. they don't stock soya milk for the coffee.,2
nice pub nice food great location just off of leicester square,5
not a great experience unfortunately very busy and took ages 2 get served,3
"without any explanation or ask of id, the bouncer rudely told my 21 year old girlfriend that she can't go in because they don't allow children in after a certain time. thanks slug and lettuce for the hospitality",1
what a fantastic place and the staff were fab highly recommend defo b back x xxx,5

nice place. much bigger than it looks from outside. it's get quite crowded like everything else in the area but it's one of the better options for younger people.,4
cocktails cocktails....great place. live music.,4
"good and drinks were served very quickly. good sized portions, was drinking cocktails which were beautifully made not just tons of ice and watered down drinks.  very good value during happy hour. ",4
"comfortable, great drinks and food deals for an after work catch up!",5
five stars for the pure entertainment and chaos,5
great bar with a great atmosphere. they hosted cancer is a drag which was an amazing night and very kind of them to do so. drinks were a little expensive but all in all a very nice bar.,4
nice place. good selection. reasonable prices.,4
horrendous trying to get served. bar staff too busy chatting up a group of ladies. most people including us left realising no chance of a drink,1
"super fast service, decent kitted out bar, one of the better slugs in london. ordered the sharing platter, tasted like the oil needed a change",4
the food was great and personal was friendly. 4 stars just because i think it was too expensive for chinese kitchen.,4
not a bad pub with cheap beer and 2 4 1 cocktails!,4
"it's slug and lettuce, keep expectations low.",2
good place to grab a drink when you're in the area.,4
very nice bar and staff,4
really disappointed only had about 5 cocktails all others were out  ( ingredients),1
"very nice staff, secured and beautiful inside decor. weekends gets busy, not enough seats",5
great cocktails,5
very nice. friendly pub.,5
loved the food and drinks. two meals sides and 8 cocktail only came to about 40.,5
busy and fun.,4
"awesome cocktails, great music",5
"great place for drinks and food. i've always found slug and lettuce a bit pricey but you pay for what you get. good comfortable setting. well lit, with friendly staff.",5
came here to watch an england match one evening. tvs in every corner. we were enjoying a table during a match and it turned out to be pre-booked. manager handled it perfectly and relocated us to an even better spot for sport. very good staff. efficient bar service. will come back.,5
grubby with 8 lagers and only one pale ale beer. no one eating?,3
nice cocktails and dessert. i did enjoy it. shame about the massive tv in the corner blaring stuff out when no one was interested in it.,4
not the cleanest looking place inside.food was just ok - nothing special although they read better. drinks were ok.,3
"average pub, with a decent seating area. the guys at the counter seemed not to be very interested and friendly, but the service was ok. cocktails were average, too much ice though. tables were a little dirty and no one came to clean them. not a bad experience,  but i won't be going again.",3
quirky venue. great beer. what's not to love?,4
a decent pub that isn't scared to fill its pints up to the correct level :-),5
bit dark in some areas,3
always love popping in here for a lunch when coming to london always chilled and friendly,5
the service is not great here and the selection of drinks is quite limited in comparison with other nearby bars and pubs,2
"and even 1 star is too generous. service is awful, meals take forever to be received and food was average at best for the price paid. go elsewhere.",1
great place to watch sport. lots of range of beef and spirits. reasonable prices for central london.,4
just had drinks there with my daughter & grandchildren plenty people eating staf very friendly,5
nice place for a drink not to busy for its location,4
well located chain pub in soho. a decent size and plenty of tv screens to watch sporting events on.,4
good fish and chips. it's nice they have table service.,5
gets very busy in here but was able to find a table. food came in an ok time. the bar is always busy from my experience so just a bit of a wait to get served.,4
great place 2 for 1 on cocktails service is great clean and tidy atmosphere  is chilled would defo go back,5
"great food, music and football also showing absolutely brilliant atmosphere",4
popped in for cocktails with a couple of friends the cocktails were amazing. lovely bloke behind the bar made us feel really welcome .,5
"great cocktails and fair prices, especially with the deals on cocktails. staff could maybe smile a bit more but it is central london.",5
some of our food was over cooked and other meals were raw and one meal didnt turn up and they didnt let us know they didnt have the ingredients for it we had to ask. very disappointing service and food would not recommend,1
food was a bargain & the drinks arnt costly either. staff were a bit unhappy & miserable. would of been nice to have a cooler with the bottle of prosecco.,5
really good cocktails! 241 on most days bargain!,4
a very busy and popular pud with emphasis on food,4
"attended the upstairs bar for a function. was a great evening, good atmosphere and friendly staff, thank you.",5
"waited over 10 minutes at the bar, beer didnt taste great, staff looked demoralised, service extremely slow service even though the venue was quiet a lot better places nearby.",2
2 for 1 cocktails what more is there to say,5
2 for 1 cocktails. can't go wrong.,5
"the  drinks were ok. service was slow. we ordered food, anything fried is well done and this was visable from other tables too. didn't  really enjoy the food. i have been  in another slug & lettuce any it was very nice. looks like it is pot luck!!!!",2
what a fantastic bar. and they had 2-for-1 cocktails. not sure if this is a limited time thing or they do this all the time. but was the bar we spent the most time in during our holiday.  great drinks. amazing staff. will definitely be back. ,5
"slow service, even though it was quiet in there. chicken tasted dirty like the grill needed cleaning. waitier was straight faced and not one smile. poor service",2
the most disgusting food ever,1
great service and fun environment!,5
nice pub. limited seating. good beer and an enjoyable atmosphere,4
"went with my colleagues for our christmas party, the food was alright. although it was missing something, the desert was way too sweet and the main didn't have an accompanying sauce or jus, bear in mind it was steak. okay experience i guess",3
"great bar and for food, great service",5
typical london pub full and loud before shows start. it was reasonably priced and the food was very good.,4
very busy  nice place,4
"overpriced, staff unwelcoming and generally what you'd expect off leicester square, if it wasn't for my bladder i'd have avoided it.",1
the stuff must be more polite,4
standard wetherspoon  house.,3
"flat beer, surly staff",1
"beer was ok, food looked like the kind of cheap pub rubbish that is mass made and shipped in. busy central  location much better local little pubs and places for food. ok if the rugby is on but much better choices. stopped in for a beer and a shandy came to 10 bit on the stiff side for what it was",2
slug & lettuce piccadilly circus has a great atmosphere. their great meals and their 2 for 1 cocktails are and added bonus as-well as very reasonable prices. very friendly staff with an amazing venue. would definitely visit again when i am in the area. keep it up s&l.,5
2-4-1 cocktails! they were amazing! the atmosphere was good/lively with good music and wide screen televisions which had the sports playing. been here a few times and would go again without a doubt. not very busy on weekdays which is a bonus! can get packed on weekends tho...,5
reserved a table at slug & lettuce in leicester square and ive never received such incredible service. every single staff member was so helpful and so kind - from the security guard to the bar attendant. i highly recommend it to everyone! special shoutout to nick for going above and beyond. im so happy i got to experience this.,5
"i love slug and lettuce but i don't like this branch!people occupy always the seat for their coat and you can't seat and have a drink and some food. nobody controls the situation and so it becomes very difficult to sit. there are so many slug and lettuce, i suggest you go somewhere else!",1
"a lot of the menu options weren't in stock when ordering which was disappointing. the staff were a bit lacklustre as well. when the food arrived, it was great and arrived quickly - handy for a pre theatre meal.",3
"lovely atmosphere, not a lot of seating space downstairs and upstairs was shut of on the sunday afternoon into evening i went. 2 for 1 of cocktails is perfect!",4
"lunch and drinks ,good value",5
bartenders are kind of rude but the cocktails are great which is a major plus,4
friendly staff. good selection of drinks at reasonable prices especially for this location.,4
food greasy starter and main course came together did same say when ordering chicken wings to start fish and chips for main,3
jam packed good place,4
"nice place,but they forgot my meal and when they finally did it was wrong dish. it was super busy so maybe because of this ",2
cocktails 2-4-1 ordered food which took a while to be served and disappointed when it arrived that most of it was nearly cold.. so much choice in the area so try other places,3
"nice place, always full of people, chill place to hang out for a few drinks with friends.",3
fine as a bar/pub but had to ask for the bar staff to finish pouring my pint of guiness as he wandered off half way through (i know it is poured in two stages) but started to serve others then went to set tables took almost 10 min to get my pint.,3
"sticky tables, not to hot on clearing up!",4
"yeah, standard. however i gave it a fourth star due to the surprisingly decent food. maybe i was just really hungry but the food was ok for a chain. not bad for a place in the centre of london.",4
"friendly bar staff but wasnt given the burger that i ordered, and it was burnt anyway. the chips were cold and dry and no salad or garnish, well over priced for what we got, wouldn't eat there again!",1
stopped for late supper.  the service was terrible and food was bad.  lasagne tasted like they used beef gravy and vegetarian lasagne was runny.,1
ok but food was cold,3
food was barely passable..just a bar with sub standard food ...nothing about the place was nice.,1
"reasonable west end watering hole. nothing special but perfectly serviceable. reasonably priced, considering location.",3
2 for 1 cocktails,5
"very dirty, sticky tables and bar. grossly overpriced  compared to similar type pubs in the area",1
good food beer wine,4
"depends what your after, a quiteish drink on paddy's night is not it.. not the venues fault but flight night tonight! we left pretty sharpish.. but all in all ok for what it is.",3
very good place to chill with friends. friendly staff and they serve food as well.,4
could be more customer friendly and/ or service oriented. liked my chicken salad though. desserts are okay.,4
"nice atmosphere,  nice staff. was 1st visit",4
loud music and a little  expensive  no choice  of ale,3
pleasant and a friendly atmosphere.,3
they were very rude. i ask for a beer and they didn't want to sell me anything without giving a reason. very disappointing. i waited a reasonable amount of time and then i left.,1
great got to go back.,5
"good happy hour pricing (2 for 1 cocktails) and the cocktails are good. semi-trashy atmosphere. dont come here for a nice date, but do come here with a group of friends!",4
"i found this place really cool, the staff are also friendly and professional. service at the bar is pronto",4
"wait over 30min to order food , even when i spoke to team he says is fine then manager game a long say no more food then she told same team member to serve food to some one else .... when i ask he said they book the table ... absolute rubbish",1
not bad value for money for center of london,4
poor all round - and not very clean either.  no draught real ale of any sort.  would be zero stars but that option not available.....,1
"great cocktails, busy but nice atmosphere",5
great pub but slow bar staff to get served,4
"rubbish service, the staff members which served us were rude and arrogant. some food didnt come out and when we asked why, they said because we ran out... when we asked if they could replace the food they simply didnt do that. would not recommend!",1
good food and reasonably priced for central london.,4
amazing and beautiful and good price,5
great place to go. cocktails were 2 for 1 and the price was really good. a bit dark upstairs though.,4
disappointed to see my long island cocktail premixed in a unmarked bottle of i don't know what. big chain cheap misleading drinks,1
"ordered the cheese and bacon burger,  with mushrooms.  the mushrooms were covered in black pepper so were inedible so were left on the plate. the bacon was burnt,  the rolls were broken and looked like basic cheap rolls. the burger was was warm not hot.  wouldn't eat here again.",1
i barman on and left after 15 mins and didnr get served,1
great for the 241 cocktails! friendly staff too,5
staff eager to accommodate you. there was 10 of us just wanting to drink and they made a table available for us even though they were fully booked. great cocktails!,5
the atmosphere was nice here. they didn't serve diet lemonade so i couldn't have a gin and lemonade because i'm type 1 diabetic and it would spike my sugars too high,3
food not good and what is this obsession with playing high volume music when people are eating and chatting.,1
without a doubt the best massage i have had anywhere. for sciatica relief no frills straight to the knots and pain points. have found my new local.,5
"professional massage shop, kindly  lovely lady in the front desk, usually had body massage with male masseur, more strong pressure nd deep massage, foot massage definitely best choice here!",5
reasonabl price. no booking. walk in only if you go there on the weekend probably you will wait 30min.,3
"great foot message!!! i highly recommend, after a long day of walk",5
"great safe massage feet and body.   trusted staff.  excellent prices. simple place, no frills but best in soho by far.",5
"i go here every time i'm in london. friendly staff, excellent job done by them.",5
fantastic foot massage.,5
"i have been looking for somewhere that does great reflexology for a while, and so happy to have found this place. :)  they really know what they are doing.  it is a firm style of reflexology, so be prepared for that - but it is very effective... i have been so much more relaxed during the week after my treatment.",5
great place for relieving pain after a long day of walking. the massage is meant to be a little rough but its really effective. people complain about the masseuses talking in chinese all the time but honestly the price and effectiveness of the massage is amazing.,5
"before the massage, my back was uncomfortable, but it was tolerable. during the massage, the pain in the whole shoulder was unbearable. the masseuse told me that my muscles were sticky and she just kneaded them open. results after the massage two days i can not sleep can not stand the pain. the experience was very bad",1
straight (absolutely no frills) reflexology place. i enjoy here but prepare to deal with noisy chatty chinese therapists who will happily chat among themselves.,5
the masseur wore gloves for the 1 hour reflexology session which meant the massage was not very comfortable,2
great to unplug and rewind. i have flat feet i suffer from walking even on even ground. reflexology is good way to relieve pressure to the feet and revitalised. this place is a no fuss professional massage and reflexology shop must visit after long day on your feet.,5
"best value for money massage in central london. experienced staff and great back and feet massages. recently renovated, but still don't expect too much from the surrounds.",5
"probably the worst reflexology i've ever had. they should just call the place a foot rub salon. they had no clue about real relexelogy points and used a stick instead of hand which is thai not chinese, and feels far inferior. the place was etremely unhygenic and staff rude and unfriendly.",1
"without a doubt the very best reflexology in london. friendly team from 25 for 30 mins but i recommend and hour at 45. body massage in safe, trusted environment, both male and female masseurs available. i can't recommend it enough, i've been coming here for 15 years !",5
nice place,5
not so great for the price you pay. very small rooms in the basement.,2
very good for a walk-in massage place!,4
non luxury but relaxing and authentic chinese massage!! ,5
no info given,5
"i stop here when i'm in london, and yeah, it's no frills, but they fixed sore spots i didn't know i had!",5
place doesn't look like anything special but the guy worked his reflexology wonder on my bruised foot and i came out 45 mins later almost healed.  would definitely recommend this place. ,5
here is very nice massage shop!! i alway go there when i visit in london!! :-),5
i have been to half a dozen british reflexologists in the past.  these guys are on a different level. absolutely recommended.,5
nice place,4
"was here in june of 2015. my husband and i had bought brand new sneakers for our trip, with a ton of walking we broke our new sneakers in all at once. our feet were extremely sore. we googled and found this place and felt like a million bucks after wards. no wait, was lucky to walk right in and get a massage.",4
"great good, real service with nice friendly people who really knew what they were doing.",5
"great value, and the masseuses will tell you, no pain no gain!!",5
the best feet massage place in london!!! you must go!! you can be sure of effective pain relief!!,5
great place with great people. the foot massage was just what i needed. will go back again. ,5
relaxed and friendly atmosphere.,4
great experience. staff was caring and friendly. this was the first time foot massage for our kids. they both enjoyed it very much.....after a long day of sightseeing.,5
i love this place. don't go if you want lute music and decorative fountains during your massage. this place is not fancy but the massages are great. ,5
"the foot massage was excellent.  if only the people wouldn't talk so loud.  chairs are to oversized and comfortable.  they do ask you to prepay, which was unusual for someone from the us, but otherwise, very nice and relaxing for the feet.",5
dont get massage from lady very bad dont do feet massage properly. and only talks too much all massage just talking very loudly and very rude. not relaxing at all lady just talk talk talk. dont waste money.,1
very dissapointing: the masseurs talk to each other very loudly in chinese while doing the massage. heho i am the one paying! shut up!,3
"nice little convenience store is the leicester square area of london.  they are well stocked and the prices are reasonable.  those running the store were friendly and helpful.  this is about one block from leicester square, three blocks west of leicester station and four blocks east of piccadilly circus station.",5
everything you need from a corner shop. personally go to see what special flavours of fanta they stock!,5
"go here regularly,  good food and good service.",4
unadvertised minimum order of 15 per person. food was subpar and extremely oil. was pressured by staff to leave upon finishing meal. not recommended at all ,1
"this place is a scam. first, they rip you off by charging 7 pounds a bottle of water and double charged on rice orders without informing the customer, food is mediocre at best (also served cold and at different times). additionally, service was poor with servers refusing or lying about price changes. avoid at all cost.",1
we went to this place multiple times and its one of the best chinese restaurant! superb service and super tasty food. highly recommend,5
amazing food and friendly staff,4
"open late, food was excellent.",5
food ok but a limited choice ..staff very nice ..but the bill includes a service charge when it's a  buffet,3
good taste but crispy duck was to sweet,3
my family ordered a pork lettuce bowl as an appetizer. when it came we found little flies all over the lettuce. i also ordered the ho fun noodles. the noodles were undercooked and tasted disgusting. we were very disappointed,1
"lovely and helpful staff. great food,reasonable prices. would highly recommend if you just want a good quick meal.",5
this massive bowl of soup (portion of 6) is wonderfully beautiful.cant get enough of this. would come back again in winter for it!!,4
its very expensive with tiny portion and the food is just so so. not good value for the amount you will pay for,1
"nice place for late night chinese in china town, rice was a little undercooked but the prawns was lovely",4
do not accept contact less payment on both amex and regular debit card - this is not shown anywhere when entering the restaurant.food quality is average what you can find chinatown.,1
great food great staff recommened,5
good food & service.,4
delicious food - not a large variety of fin sum but very fresh and tasty.,5
good food with friendly staff. a bit pricey though.,4
friendly staff and delicious food!,5
"very good service, we were squeezed in at a busy time but very efficient friendly staff and good fresh food at west end prices.",5
this is the second time we've been in a month and i must say our food selection was so much better this time round. dimsum was great as usual but the scallops with asparagus and seafood udon noodles were amazing. prices were as you would expect in london and service was fast and attentive.,4
same food as a take away but 3x the price. still tasty. wrongly brought out 1/2 duck instead of 1/4 and refused to deduct their mistake from the bill. then asked for tip on the card machine despite already charging 12.5% automatically. the bill isn't itemised so they try and fleece you in any sneaky way they can.,2
"could not have been better, a culinary explosion of tastes ...",5
chinese restaurant  enjoyed the dim sum.  didn't eat from the main menu.  friendly and helpful staff.,4
meal order up to 15 per person.ive been there many times. but this time i wasnt hungry just want to drink and have some starter with my friend.staff wasnt happy and asked me to order more. this is the last time i will go there.,1
decent dim sum in london chinatown.,3
hey. a chilled dim sum spot in china town that does dim sum after 1pm. not overpriced. will be back. bless,5
"minimum spend, and 15 per person which is the highest ive seen in chinatown. not like its especially popular. not like the quality is spectacular. doesnt have a michelin recommendation like its neighbour. it gives the impression of a tourist trap with the woman outside calling you in. eat elsewhere.",1
good food,5
a great place for inexpensive dim sum in chinatown. glad theyve kept the molten lava steamed bun in the menu - rarely seen nowadays!,4
i went on a friday night with a group of five. the food was nice but the service for getting served was very slow and some of the food came cold,3
delightful little chinese restaurant just off leicester square. good food and seems to cater for varying references. reasonably priced too,4
great food - vivienne was very helpful!,5
"if you planning a dim sum in the area , here is the place to be. food quality is constant trough the years, and, prices too.staff is polite and helpful...",4
lovely food selection and great authentic quality. we keep going back,5
"never fails to dissappoint, have been going back here time and time again over the years and always leave satisfied. set menu b delivers every time.",5
food and services we're great . we were well look after.,4
"dim sum was amazing and staff were very friendly. great value too, this place should be rated higher!",5
excellent dim sum! well worth the trip to town for it.,5
"certainly one of the best chinese places in central london. the food is superb and the prices - while central london - still much better value for money than most. the service, despite reviews to the contrary, i have always found snappy and friendly. have the soft shell crab, you wont look back!",5
"awful food quality. not sure this qualifies as authentic chinese food, in fact, not sure what it qualifies as. p.s. serves the worst peking duck ever",1
we had a variety of dim sum and barbecued  meat. every dish was fine but nothing stood out. prices and service as area standard,4
very friendly staff and great food. the decor is pretty and the service was less rushed than many of the gerrard street restaurants which is nice. great value for money and i look forward to going back.,5
great meal on xmas eve. pretty authentic. and damn tasty.,4
yesterday was there me and my girlfriend  we had fried noodles chow mein was so good,5
good food and great green tea. we have been here a few times and the food is always good.,4
"great food, good quality and perfect service. very close to leister square - you can't go wrong.",5
i loved the food. the service was also nice. the waiter/host was very kind and always smiling which gives you a sense of comfort.,5
fantastic chinese restaurant in china town the crispy duck is one of the best i've e er had. lovely friendly service and great value for money. i'll be back.,4
really nice staff and good dim sum! would recommend :),5
staff was so friendly! food was pretty good too and very well priced.,5
fantastic 'chefs menu'. the duck is to die for. really good service.,5
think i ordered the wrong thing as a lot of other reviewers rave about the food here but i found it quite average and pricy compared to other restaurants in the area. avoid their sweet and sour dishes...,3
very good dim sum,4
fairly bland. better places to go,2
goood always,5
great food but they dont understand how sherry is served. they serve it like a short !!@@,5
arrived sunday noon on the dot and was served quickly.  no prices on the menu which is why i knocked a star off.,4
good restaurant. amazingly helpful and bubbly staff (especially the malaysian lady waitress) and food was delicious!!,5
best chinese food i've had in a while.. good service and vibe..,5
"the food is not great, just check my pictures... we ordered soup, starters and a main, it came first the main, then the starters and the soup came the last... poor service and overpriced ",2
"ridiculous waiting time for takeaway (25 min), and to add salt to injury i found out they gave me the wrong stuff only when i got home.",1
"superb food superb, friendly service. excellent value for money.",5
"the best in china town, great service, amazing food, beats all the other chinese restaurants in china town by a mile",5
best food and service ever!!!!,5
"i liked the food very much , great choice thanks to grandmaster randy williams and his diverse exquisite taste.. the crab was to die for ..",4
"the service was very disappointing. took nearly 40 mins to bring out our rice after our main course has come and we had to ask the waitress 3 times to remind her. the food was average, a little bit oily but in general it was ok.",2
excellent food and service.  beautiful meal for myself   my daughter and grandson.  perfectly cooked food.  staff friendly and professional.,5
here food was nice but courtesy was missing in my opinion.,3
tasty food and very nice staff),5
"had two starters, two mains, one chow mein with two small beers. food was nice but i have had better in china town to be honest. bill was 62. ",3
very nice and quick service. love the did sum there too! :),5
good chinese food at reasonable prices. they accommodated us straight away and staff were lovely throughout! ,5
"good, open late",4
our usual restaurant joy king lau was full so we came here. it was very nice indeed. everything was very tasty. ,4
a nice place to visit if you require your  hair done,2
"good hair salon. went for a shampoo, cut and blow-dry that cost 40.00 (i had long hair). always busy and a popular place for both men and women.great head massages when they wash your hair.",4
"happy with results! had a walk-in appointment to cut off 6 inches of damaged hair. quick to be served and had a few laughs about the mess my hair was before getting it fixed up. reasonable prices, great result. would return!",5
"wash and cut for 19 in the westend. totally understood my hair. i'm half asian and western hairdresser's/barbers do a good job but don't understand what is the best cut for my hair, how to fade and layer it.",5
my friend told me about this salon nearly 2 years ago and since then christabel never turned me down. she8888 professionally handles your hair and will tell you if the hairstyle will fit you or not.... well reccomended to othrt friends...,5
"nice haircut, like my new look! thanks christabel for the great service and professional recommendation.",5
"christabel or as you called her, bel, has cut my hair for years now! great stylist, great haircut, and great chat!",5
"i was recommended tangs salon by a friend and had my hair done by christabel. she was great! i wasnt sure what to have but she knew exactly what my hair needed and what would look good for my face shape. super friendly, would highly recommend",5
great haircut! lady alice saved my hair from a previous ugly cut. highly recommend lady alice!!! ,5
"good and professional services from christabel. if the staff can give a proper head massage for the hair wash, it'll be even better.",5
the staff is very friendly and thoughtful. they gave me tea while i was waiting. the service is decent and professional,5
"cristabel is a good stylist, highly recommend ",5
"i love it here. staff r friendly. jennifer is very good, she always does my hair perfectly. :) ",5
great hair cuts been going here for the last 2 years ,5
"it's in a hidden alley, which is on the left on pizzaexpress. opposite of c&r restaurant.very nice hair stylist, especially if you're looking for southeast asian styles.",5
ive been going to harry in this salon for the past 9 years. ive tried many other hair stylists but always find myself going back to harry. he always cut just the amount i ask for and he shows genuine care for the health of my hair!,5
very talkative and kind girl. a very good friend and all my classmates find bellthank you very much for taking care of my hair in a year! very stylish! thanks,5
great service. lovely head massage at shampoo. stylist is very professional and friendly and  cut it as i asked.  didn't have to wait long and the price is very decent. definitely go back again.,5
so happy this 4years i get a nice hair cut and colour from christable. she really knows me well and she very honest. while so upset that in future can't continue get haircut with her. for me want to get a hairdresser who suit me is very hard. highly recommended christable she really good in her skills.,5
conveniently placed where i can tie in doing some groceries.  my stylist christabel has done a great job transitioning my hair from short to mid.  does a consistent cut and takes care which is hard to find.,5
"best hairsalin in chinatown. i had christable to cut my hair, perfect work, did exactly what i asked!",5
great cut ! ,5
good barber but a bit too expensive ,4
"really good service, a bit too expensive though",4
disappointed this time,2
great friendly service. cash only though!,4
best service i ever had :) i will be back.,5
"im of african decendent and i went there to get my japanese blowdry, it was great my hairdresser was really nice. service was good, if you have money you're willing to invest, go there",4
"i had a great haircut today with christable, she provided great service and is always reliable. have been coming back ever since i've moved here!",5
"the salon is not very clean, the one who wash your hair didn't do it tenderly and almost hurt my neck. not satisfied with the hair style either, hairdresser avoid to provide what i want just because she didn't know how to do it. i got so much nicer hair style somewhere else after she destroy the whole style.",1
wash and cut for 19 quid. cant complain.,5
been going to this salon for my haircut over the last 6 years. my favourite hairdresser is alice,5
"my hairdresser, christabel, was great and knew exactly how i wanted to style my hair. shes friendly and professional and gets the job done! ive been to the salon a few times now and will definitely go there again.",5
"christabel did my hair cut keratin treatment and the result was brilliant. i am very happy with the end result. christabel was so kind and attentive and took care of everything. if you want a good hair day everyday, ask for christabel x",5
"belle has been cutting my hair for many years here now and i have got to say i would not let anyone else touch my hair. if shes cutting your hair, youre in good hands, she will listen to you and make sure you will walk away happy!",5
good service and very fast.,5
i just had my hair straightened at tangs salon and it was brilliant! cristabel is very friendly and i will surely recommend this salon,5
"i went to tang's salon to get a haircut. i had relatively long hair and wanted to get a shoulder-length hairstyle. christabel understood what i wanted and cut my hair really well! overall, the service was quick and good!",5
"excellent service - christabel always puts in her best effort, i'm a regular here!",5
highly recommended. i don't go anywhere else for hair cuts.  christabel has a great sense of what looks good and a stylist with a great eye for detail. she is also very funny. i just wish they had a happy hour for haircuts so i can get discounts.,5
service is fast i did not wait long for my turn as i had made an appointment in advance. booked christabel she is friendly and make sure i walk out of the salon with a nice new look.,4
friendly and efficient staff at tang's salon. excellent haircut by christabel!,5

"quite good chinese restaurant,you can try one.",4
"went there with a few friends. really enjoyed my lunch there. the staff were very attentive, personal and bubbly made us feel rather special.dim sum was great.",5
there are better places which serve good dim sum. their dim sum are very oily (if you order buns) and you won't get any sauce to eat the food with. highly disappointed given the high review.,1
amazing dim sum..... took an hour out of afternoon and my wife and i enjoyed 4 dim sum and some refreshing chinese tea...my god it was sooooo tasty and fresh!worth a visit!!!,5
spicy selection was ok - food was not too special imo,4
"dim sum are excellent - try the grilled turnip cakes!  but most of all, incredibly friendly, efficient and charming service every time.  in chinatown this is a real rarity nowadays.",5
great food and very friendly service. 100% recommend this resturant. i will continue to go back to tao tao ju for lunch or dinner whenever i am in the area.,5
we were there on sunday evening at about 8:30 pm and they didnt let us in because they were about to close. that is totally not ok when the opening hours are stated as open until 11:30 pm.,1
good quality and presentation of dim sum. food served hot and good service.,4
"that is perfect.i recommende this restaurant.i come here second time. here is wonderful service.the stuff is very smart.when we finish hen meal,they complimentary fruit for us.always fill water.the food is brilliant.i will come back.",5
the best chinese food.staff is very friendly and helpful because they are allow me to change mobile phone. he is ok for me to order dish isn't on menu. food is delicious.,5
really good food and service. a wide choice and good selection of set banquets,4
"fabulous food, been here twice and each time fabulous food and great friendly service. but is very busy. better book a table.",5
good food but a bit slow.,4
"i know, i know... too much choice in chinatown right? however, i'm proud to say that as a londoner, i keep coming back here for a wonderful meal every time i visit chinatown. always good service!",5

super friendly staff and nice to kids too,5
"food was great, but staffs were not so kind.",4
food was amazing!!,5
veggie dumpling and several other veggie options here.,4
if your looking for the typical 'english' chinese food done well with good service at a reasonable price then look no further.,5
disgusting. cheap greasy and far from authentic,1
"extremely rude, they will not honor online bookings, be warned.",1
food is lovely.,5
"worst restaurant i ever been. the fish is half-steamed, and then the waiter sent the fish back to the kitchen and cook again. it's so disgusting.",1
"excellent, some of the best chinese food i've had, let down slightly by the patchy service, be prepared to keep waving to catch the attention of the staff. ",4
nice dim sum,4

great food and service as always ...,5
"great service, but the food is too salty.",4
amazing dinner and very friendly staff highly recommended ,5
went here for a romantic dinner and got a hugely disappointing overpriced meal instead. dishes were ranging from generic to plainly bad. either bland or overly sweet. dimsum tasted as if it was cooked from from frozen.,1
tasty food. quick service and very polite.,4
serve average to good asian food at a too high price.,3
"highly recommended! service was great, the staffs there was very nice and most importantly the food was great! we tired both dim sum dishes and main course dishes and both came out great! will defiantly visit again! ",5
they have the worst food.,1
"food was bland and disappointing. even something as simple as a fried rice turned out so so. from the overall score, i expected much better.",2
"very quick and friendly service, amazing dumplings and dishes at a reasonable price, excellent!",5
delish,4
"fantastic food and wine we ordered a set meal b, service very good as well defo coming back",5
"nice surroundings and staff, but the food was very hum drum - reheats.  e.g. my tofu'd been fried up some time earlier, microwaved, then peppers, onions and sweet and sour added.  should do a bit better than that i think.",3
"it feels like at home, great chinese kitchen with yummy dim-sum dumplings!",5
can't remember last time i had this good a meal in chinatown.  head above shoulders over the rest ,4
"good food and good service, i have eaten the b meal twice and a meal once and always a lot of food so you won't go home hungry",4

a frequent visit in china town - i definitely recommend it.,5
"a wonderful place to eat, good food and friendly staff members.it can get a little crowded being but still good for family or groups of friends to enjoy.",5
really nice food and we were able to be in and out fairly quickly when we told the staff we had a show to see,4

"worst chinese experience i ever had. food was of poor quality, the place wasnt clean, service was rough and awful. do not ever go there.",1
good portions and tasty dishes,4
a score of 3.5 because the pad thai and won ton soup were quite bad so we could not eat it. the rest of the food was good. lovely calm music and atmosphere. i will not be coming back.,4
"food was good, staff were pleasant. 5 star hygiene rating which is a bonus. would recommend and return.",4
"had a good basic meal here in this deceptively spacious restaurant. plenty of room at the back with a nice naturally-lit room - a rarity in this part of town.a bit pricey though - 60 for four people, when none of us ordered that much...",4
disappointing. half-duck is mostly skin and crisps little meet more like half fillet. dimsum from frozen better get a tray in good chinese supermarket.,1
"great little chinese, well organised always busy",4
"tasted really good, but some of the dim sum was a little sticky and fell apart easily.",4
wonderful experience and some of the best chinese food i've ever tasted,5

expensive for a reason. a cut above the normal chinese,5
"must try, the fried reddish cake. super friendly service staffs. best tim sum.",4
spacious and very comfortable. good food - sunday dim sum lunch was quite tasty and not overpriced. a  good restaurant to go to (plenty of asian customers which is always a good sign)!,4
delicious food. good service. 5 star hygiene rating. friendly staff.,5
"great food, the steam scallops were nice and juicy and fresh. the stuffed bitter melon was great too! try to get a table at the rear of the restaurant as there is a glass roof and it is lovely especially lunch time. great value and staff are helpful. one of the better restaurant in chinatown.",5
service was friendly. but the food very pedestrian. house fried rice was okay. nothing special though. the ho fun was absolutely terrible. dumplings were fine. nothing that i would go back for.,2
"huge disappointment on food & service. we were asked to leave as another guests are arriving after 1 hour. food was better when i last came here - the ma po tofu was not good, fried rice average, really pricey for what it is. not visiting again.",1
"great food, great price and great staff",5

beautiful staff and lovely food wonderful experience xxx,5
"excellent food although a bit pricey. great service, we were delayed on the train for pre-theatre dinner but we were able to telephone the restaurant en route and they had our order ready extremely quickly when we turned up. the mix veg is absolutely great!",4

"food was fine,service was good and price reasonable.",4
"good food, good service and good atmosphere.",4
"food was good, service was ok",3
really enjoyed all the garlic and chilli in the chicken dish i chose.  lovely staff.,4
look out!!!check your menu!!! the dim sum menu is supposed to have the prices you see outside on the board. they seem to only give it to chinese and try to charge westerners from a much more expensive menu. so sad since the dim sum is actually real good.,1
very good food!,5
really enjoyed the food here. beware of the 1 star reviews left by people with no other reviews!,5
"slightly more upscale than the rest of china town. the service and decor is a bit above the average. slightly more pricey. i thought the food was very good, but the wife thought it was too salty. would visit again.",4
excellent value in china town. lovely room upstairs.,5
"amazing chinese food, best i've ever had! a little expensive but the food is definitely worth it. we booked a table beforehand as we were a table of 10. despite being so many of us there were no issues and service was great.",5
great food and considering we were a large group the service was good too,4
meal was fine.....very good,5

just had a meal at tao tao ju this evening and i must say it was very tasty served buy courteous staff who went out of their way to please and even gave us half a glass of wine gratis. i would definitely recommend this restaurant as good value with nice surroundings and lovely staff. a gem in china town.,5
one of the nicest chinese restaurants in london. great location. amazing food. chong helped me make a selection and the food was incredible. i will definitely return. great service. extremely friendly and really authentic. it cant get better than this.,5
"wonderful, food and service.",5
we had three different types of dumplings all of them were very tasty. the mix veg chow mein was also great. went on a saturday evening when it was very busy and so the staff were very keen to get people to leave as quickly as possible so new people could get seated but i dont see a massive problem with that.,5
the food is good. place a bit tight. we had a baby and the staff were helpful. they don't add 12.5% to the bill for mediocre service like a lot of the restaurants in china town so a point for that.,4
"good selection of food.nice menu c with lobster, the only thing was we had lots of lobster parts with no flesh just shell.",4
"great food, good spacious tables, efficient service, friendly staff, a touch pricy but to be expected in this neck of the woods. crispy duck was particularly excellent.",4
best chinese in chinatown! maybe not the most beautiful ambiente but best food from various i tried in chinatown!!,5
oh yum ... set meal b is to die for... go hungry .. very friendly staff too and the service is faultless,5
amazing food  definitely recommend!!,5
"ridiculously overpriced, very average food, rude staff. issued a bill in the middle of the meal. waiters directly and blatantly asked for tips. surely their business model is based on the assumption that vast majority of customers will never return there.",1
expensive  and food quality was not worth the price. dry duck. maybe because  it was late at 9pm?,3
tasty food chicken chow mein   good portions yummy ,5
"good food, but the environment does not justify its price",3
"amazing, great value! ",5
good food and a reasonable price,5
"good food,!nice staff a little expensive, but no for london.",4
"food was not good. dim sum were simply awful. the only thing good was the service, very attentive staff!",2
it is always good to have a good chinese meal after many days of western food in london. the taste is authentic and the price is reasonable for london's standard. try it! ,5
went to tao tao ju with some friends for lunch today and was not disappointed ! my wife and i have not experienced much authentic chinese before but had our friends order for us from the dim sum menu. everything we tried we really liked ! it was very very good and we would come back in a heart beat. a must try !,5
"i have been to tao tao ju many times and i always had great food. the service is not amazing, they are very busy so you need to expect a fast service and sometimes not extremely friendly. they have a large room at the back of the restaurant that can accommodate a big group of people.",5
absolutely brilliant food and great service well definitely be going again,5
"same price as the restaurants in the area with the difference of being clean, stylish place and really good service.",5
"so rude. i tried a number if times to book a table and was just hung up on instead of being asked to hold. when i finally got through they told me they were fully booked, i explained it was for today, again they said it doesn't matter we are booked!?!? i asked when they next had availability and they just said no and hung up.",1
"friendly and good table service with plenty of seating upstairs and to the rear. we ordered set menu, tasted good. crispy beef was more crispy than beef, loved the sweet and sour pork. check the bill, before paying. but would highly recommend a visit. very popular with chinese and british.",4
horrible service! don't recommend at all! worst experience in my life,1
lovely scrumptious food  excellent service of staff very friendly,5
excellent food and great service,5
nice cozy romantic place. good food,5

really great food. loved it...,5
great food for a really great price!,5
great place. late dim sum. very good quality - pak choi came in at gargantuan 10 (ordered off menu) but overall wonder atmosphere. nice fast service. will definitely return although sans pak choi!,4
"absolutely amazing food,best i've ever had, fast service and really friendly staff,cant wait to visit again",5
"ordered crispy pork from menu.  a different pork dish turned up.  called waiter back, he explained that there was no crispy pork as we had come too late in the day.  food was ok, not great, but they clearly don't give a fig.",2
"yum cha, good selection of dim sum at reasonable price, especially the custard bao, service is good and attentative. seating is spacious and comfortable.  would recommend for yum cha, had dinner before but not as good.",4

very good chinese restaurant and the roast duck is a must!,4
relatively expensive and small portion size hong kong classic pasta-dried fried niu he: salty beef roasted duck and pork: too salty  seafood tofu hotpot: hot food in cold pot.  uncooked/cold vegetable was just left at the bottom of the cold pot.,2

greay food and prices for location. has big gluten free menu for those interested.,5
"difficult to find the positive, the room was cold, staff forgot to put our order through.when the hot plates came out the food followed 15 mins later so the plates were cold by then.  the food was average at best had much better from take always.certainly not worth the cost",2
the food is amazing here. one of my favourite places to eat in london!,5
amazing food,5
not now please,3
"i went to thai tho tomight with 6 of my students.  both the food and service were excellent.  all the staff were highly professional, especially tara, who was very attentive to our needs.  this will help to leave them with a positive memory of their time in england so thank you very much.  really great food, well done.",5

the spicy pork stir fry was quite tasty. this restaurant is actually well upstairs and it would be rather challenging for a handicapped person. i think the staff is new because i had to work to get their attention.,4

"stop putting sugar in your sauces! seriously! i ordered thai fried noodles with chicken and while it was okay tasting, it was too sweet. it's a sign of a really bad cook to put too much sugar in sauces, because it's a cheap way to make it taste better on the first bite. but towards the end it starts tasting gross.",3

this is one of the best restaurant ive been. the food is great the service is friendly,5

the kubaneh and courgette tzatziki were great. mains were average. service was amazing and quick but the place itself was very crowded.,4

"fantastic menu and great staff, excellent food all along. cocktails are fresh and deliciously good",5
"i feel awful doing this as the service is utterly 5 star but i feel the food was average when you consider the prices.  i can only assume the 5 stars as because it's the west end and a tourist trap.  some good dishes and some very ok ones , on par with something like meza in tooting.  soz guys are you're so nice",3

"palomar is a must everytime im in london. one of the top resturants there ..the food was so amazing.. orders are in small plates so you get to taste as many dishes as u can .very innovative yet simple ingredients, and outcome is outstandingthe staff are friendly and very helpful.",5

"coolest restaurant i have been in london. high quality food, good price and excellent service. highly recommended.",5
brilliant brilliant brilliant venue. the food was amazing but the experience of sitting in front of the chef while he did his thing was brilliant. definitely recommend to visit & try everything. its all so good. got a show around the place by the chef which made the whole experience extra special,5
"i sat at the counter, and there's a fantastic energy there. too much of london is merely pleasant and polite---this place was refreshingly fun and alive. food and cocktails were excellent. i especially enjoyed the octopus but was dining solo so didn't get to try too many things. will be back!",5
"had a mid-week lunch here - good sharing plates and options, jerusalem chicken has good flavor to it, but could have been more succulent. other dishes were average.  the bread and dips were fine but nothing to make this restaurant more favorable than other mediterranean ones in london.",4
one of my favorite restaurants ever. there is nothing on their menu that i tried and didn't like. i try to go every time i'm in london. i recently purchased their cookbook (they sell it at the restaurant). i am excited to try some of the recipes. service is fast and friendly. highly recommend.,5
one of my favourite places to eat in london.  you sit at the bar.  cant book so you need to put your name down.  i recommend doing this around 18:00 if youre prepared to eat later.  there are sittings for 18:00 that you can book in advanced if youre happy to eat early.,5
"great staff with a lot of experience and good vibe. the food is tasty, we loved the scallops   and the cobaneh.",5
get a seat at the bar for a great view of the chefs and cocktail guys at work. great atmosphere and the food is wonderful. just returned to the palomar nye dinner and it did not disappoint! fantastic set menu great atmosphere and amazing service.,5
this delightful restaurant gave us an incredible meal. the staff were professional and very knowledgeable about the food they were serving to us. dips were incredible! this really felt like a family-run restaurant taken to the highest level of standard.,5
this place must be one of the best restaurants in london. the food was absolutely delicious. note that the place is usually fully booked. make sure you reserve your table at least a couple of weeks ahead. weve tried most of the dishes from the menu and each was simply wonderful.,5
excellent main dishes. the palenta and chicken livers were a standout. the restaurant provides a very intimate atmosphere in the back or a more active atmosphere at the bar. the appetizers were good and desert was decent. service was also great. highly recommended.,5
"i just have to say the best bread, and hummus i have ever eaten. i still have dreams about it!the mains were not as good as the starters but that just maybe because the food is so so so good!love their drinks too!",5
"lovely food. great service.  busy. recommend seating ""in the back""",5
one of the best restaurants i have ever been into london so far. food was fantastic :),5

"dishes served at paloma are small and varied, so choose a few for each person and take your time enjoying each one. palomar has an authentic mediterranean:middle eastern fusion which delivers a wonderful culinary journey.",5
"great food and service in this trendy and busy place, prices are appropriate for the quality of food and flavor. dishes are made fresh and in front of you if you sit at the bar. you definitely have to reserve!",5
"lovely experience, lovely food, lovely staff",5
"excellent food and super cocktails, really worth the wait. difficult to get a table and not a kosher restaurant as advertised but really great tasty stuff.",5
"amazing restaurant!  loved the dips, the octopus and chicken dishes.  would have passed on the lamb and pork in future.  still, 5 stars overall, great service and wonderful food!",5
"amazing food and service. the bread is to die for. tree of life (whole roasted broccoli),  artichokes and sea bass also excellent.",5
"the food never disappoints. try to get a table at the bar, its great fun watching the kitchen team whip up the dishes in front of your eyes. good options for vegetarians as well! try to book ahead as this place is popular!",5
great food experience in the heart of london.,5
excellent food. really struggling to think of anything negative about the visit. hoghly recomended.,5
special sea bass was the best fish dish i've ever ate!,5
"excellent food. amazing atmosphere, sitting at the open kitchen bar with view of the kitchen, bar and service areas. service was friendly and efficient. just wish we had more time to enjoy but we had to leave for the opera. only available to book for 1730 otherwise it's first come first served.",5
amazing place,5
"great food, friendly staff and great price-quality! went here for lunch, definitely go for the harissa chicken. the spice merguez is good as well, but like it says it's spicy. ow and the burrata, take that as well!!!",5
incredible food and fantastic staff,5
"really one of my favourite lately. the food is amazing, cocktails are delicious and the service is awesome. what else would you want?great location and super nice place. see you soon!",5
while israeli food itself wasn't my thing....the quality was good and the employees were all super nice and professional...,5
"authentic middle eastern food with a gourmet twist. great friendly service too, sit by the bar for seeing the chefs in action.",5
"unique food. cool vibes. as someone who's familiar with the source (in jerusalem) i have to say that it's a little overrated,  and not as good as the original.still, it's definitely worth the visit.just don't forget to either make a reservation of come early and get a spot at the bar.",4
"very nice place to eat, no complaints at all, will be coming back in the near future.",5
this was a magical experience. went for an evening meal with family. everything from fabulous new food flavours and great service. plus you can purchase their cook book and i've already started making some of their delicious recipes.we can't wait to go back.,5
"interesting menu, fresh tasty food, service a bit slow but with a smile",4
"great middle eastern cuisine, small plates, great vibe. would recommend",5
"just want to say that i love the barbary - the palomar's sister restaurant - which is why i was so so disappointed. it is of course a great looking spot and the service was good but i'll probably never go back. my advice, go to the barbary - cheaper and absolutely a sure thing.",2
super fun place with a very chill vibe. the chef and the staff are hilarious and are gleaming with positive vibe. the food is great although i found a couple dishes a tad bit salty. would most certainly return! i would highly recommend anyone to give this restaurant a shot!,5
"highly recommend this restaurant. had the harissa chicken - tender and delicious. also try the beetroot and goat's cheese, the fatoush and the falafel. lovely flavours and attentive staff. probably the best we had on our london visit.",5

"i'm japanese, and i don't see why people gave them so great reviews, especially japanese people. we had nigiri set and katsu curry and it was okay, it didn't taste great. but i guess it can't be helped for such cheap pricing in a great location. over all, it's better to cook them at home.",3
nice & tasty..,5
"nicely tucked in the street, tasty food, good menu and friendly staff",5
"had a quick dinner of udon. it was okay but nothing special, price was okay but smaller portion sizes compared to other places. the katsu curry looked good and may come back to try other things on menu. service was good.",3
the best japanese in london. it's like a recreation of japan in london.,5
"nice people and some tea is offered on arrival. however i discourage anyone from taking the noodle plate, served cold and tastless. inside is very small.",1

"efficient, no tipping. recommend chicken katsu don, miso soup and a sapporo lager. never disappoints.",5
"great experience and not too pricey. it was a saturday evening, and we managed to get a table for the two of us. they have real japanese cuisine, so if you are not an experienced sybarite, you may have some surprises.of course, they give you some things to wait for your order and green tea.",4
"had lovely tofu, amazing japanese tea and excellent sushi. their humble atmosphere and friendly service really makes it, first time i feel like ive eaten wholesome japanese food. will be coming here again",5

lovely place. great service and super tasty food. wanted to go again but wife wanted to try somewhere else,5

"good prices and great service, with free tea throughout the meal. the food seemed a bit bland, but that comes down to personal preference.",4
"one of my favourite japanese restaurants. we ordered pork katsudon  and it was amazing as always.  reasonably priced and super friendly staff. they give you different kinds of green tea depending on the season, for free :) and don't accept tips, just like in japan ",5
"authentic japanese food experience at a reasonable price in london? yes, please! no bookings available just show up and hope for a seat, but honestly tables free up pretty quickly so no need to worry!",5
gorgeous food in the most teeny tiny space,5
"fantastic place, i always visit every time i'm in london",5
the place is cosy and cool even during a very hot summer afternoon. the staff are polite and food came really quick. my only disappointment is the lack of choice between noodle dishes and soups along side with the quality of the famous 'chicken katsu curry' which did not live up to its name.,3
"i haven't been to tokyo diner for 6 years after moving out of uk, but it has always been a regular visit when living here for over 12years.happy to say it's still consistency good tasting food just how i remember! thank you, i'll be back!",5

fantastic food and great service. very accommodating to veggies,5
"cheap and fast. tastes cheap and fast. not that it's bad, it's just not as good as japanese food can get. i had high hopes. but they did a great job with getting our food out quick due to it being an hour before a show. bento boxes look good.",2
huge food portion. the japanese katsu curry (crispy fries pork cutlet) is delicious. authentic japanese fast-food meal at affordable price. tucked away in chinatown. plenty of seating space in basement downstairs as well. fast table turnaround.,5
it is good to go to a japanese owned by japanese people,5
"simple, straightforward japanese food. forget about the huge range of dishes of other japanese spots. this one has a small offer. their focus is on the quality. tried a million times. never disappointed.",5
"great food, great service. what i especially loved is how they have a whole page of the menu dedicated to what kind of allergens are in the menu items! it could have literally been life or death for me here if i had ordered the curry not expecting peanuts but instead this whole place just gave me life. sayonara!",5
great food and terrific service!,5
yeah.  its worth the wait.,4
authentic japnese food,5
"this is by far my favourite japanese in town. it is very reminiscent of japan's izakayas. the food is delicious and very well presented, the tea is lovely, and the service is good, too. it is no wonder this place is always busy.",5
this is an affordable place where you can eat propper asian food and they give you green tea for free,3
love this place. great service. amazing food. so authentic and so reasonably priced. if there's a queue it's worth the wait and the line often goes down quickly. lots of free tea! would highly recommend.,5
"one of two places that serves katsudon within the area. great customer service, and the food was delicious! minus one star (i kid still 5 stars) for the pork meat being too hard, which i can understand considering the price point. i will definitely be coming back.",5
"food is fine, but not fantastic. service is fairly perfunctory. we were a group of six and got seated in the basement, despite the upstairs area being relatively empty and ended up being on our own there for the entire meal. it had zero ambience - no music and minimal decor.",3
been there several times over the years. always really good food and service. plus it's really good value for money. it's our go-to japanese restaurant. we judge the other ones comparing them to tokyo dner.,5
"great food, at a good price, with good service",4
good food and cozy space for a decent price.,5
always delicious ad fresh food. amazing staff,5
cozy little japanese eatery that serves authentic and delicious japanese food! service was quick and efficient as well. the only downside was the meat of my katsu curry was a bit too tough!,5
"staffs and food were great and made me felt like eating in a japanese restaurant in japan actually... they don't encourage the customers to pay tips at all, which is kinda interesting to know in the uk.",5
"been coming here for years, always busy but they never seem to be put out or impolite. sushi is consistently good but that's about it",3
"wonderful place, very tasty, staff were awesome. true japanese vibe, they give complementary tea and snacks, tips are banned etc.we ate the curry and the katsu don, both were great, nice size and the gravy was excellent.",5
great and simple japanese food for an affordable price.with a lovely and authentic atmosphere as well,5
excellent food and staff along with a very traditional atmosphere,5
"amazingly good! simple but authentic japanese food, with very attractive price.",5
amazing service and the food was very authentic! we had free snacks and japanese tea on arrival. i also liked that we were given our bill after we ordered so it allowed us more freedom to leave when we wanted.,5
the food was ok. although the portions were really small. i like the fact that they care about the sustainability (they don't serve tuna). also the webcam idea was also cool!,3

excellent food at decent prices. have been here multiple times.,4

excellent food. very kind staff. i saved the address !,5

its a veey honest sushi restaurant that serves quality food at a pretty decent prices. they don't serve tuna as a way to protect and preserve it.100% recommended,5
authentic food and interior. food is pretty good at a very reasonable price. our waiter was not particularly friendly but this was near the end of her shift on a saturday so all is forgiven. overall there are definitely better japanese restaurants in london but this is a great alternative for a casual night out with friends.,4

"i love japanese food and someone recommended that i try this place, so i stopped for dinner. i had the katsu don. service was friendly but i wasn't impressed by the food. the batter on the pork was soggy. the rice seemed too soft and wet (possibly overcooked?). flavour wasn't great.  i would not return.",3

the best! amazing food and like being in japan.,5
nice friendly staff and food is cheap and authentic. would recommend!,5

"delicious pho, perfect for a quick catch up with friends",5
beef pho is perfect!,5
"i love this restaurant, the service is great and the food reasonably priced and fantastic to eat",5
this is not banh xeo! what is this?! salad is too small to wrap the banh xeo in. its like a cracker where you have to add your seafood on top...taste wasnt good either.,1
throughly enjoyable experience..with wonderful company,5
best pho i've ever eaten.,5
"quick service, delicious authentic food, very reasonably priced for the location. i recommend the bun and the summer rolls.",5

"food was delicious and the staff were friendly and helpful, accomodating our large group by moving tables around. love the decor and ambience too.",5
"this is not about the food, because we never made it in. the manager deliberately oversaw us twice to accommodate a bigger party which is unacceptable. pity, the place looked good but they apparently can choose their costumers as they see fit. we left slightly disgusted.",1

"delicious, clean, great service",5
small portions but good food,5

second time at this china town restaurant did not disappoint! last time i had one of the phos and this time i went for the beef bun. both very yummy!,5

"great menu choice, friendly and professional staff, quick service. menu choose too big))",4
liked this place alot. only point to make concerns the pho broth. i was hoping it to be more flavorful. other than that it's a great haven for a break accompanied with some nice food in a busy part of the city.,4
"not cheap, but definitely worth every penny. whatever you order, take the signature cocktail with it ;)",4
"for me, all dishes i ordered are tasteless. this is the first restaurant in the uk i've experienced with the required minimum order (10 per person). i actually weren't hungry, but my friend was. so, i need to order one more dish.",3
"happily got a seat on the lunar new years day. their lamb chops are a bit heavy but lovely, with a good price (9.5gbp). salad, beef soup are both nice. warm service. the staff i met are all chinese though. love the vibes. there could be a queue outside but the turnover speed is quite fast.",5
"love this place. food offering is varied and are very good at fairly reasonable prices, especially for the west end of london.don't miss the bar on the top floor for intimate drinks with friends or loved ones. they also do good cocktails.",5

"one of my favourite restaurants in london, great flavours at reasonable prices - i could eat here every week.",4
very delicious and homey vietnamese food. traditional and cheap with great portions!,5
really good vietnamese food. it gets very busy and the music is really loud so it's hard to hear but the food makes up for that!,5
you get a very good fresh cooked breakfast my take a while but hey saying that it is freshly cooked well worth the wait.,5
the pho was ok; noodles and broth were very average. not much flavor going on.,3
best pho of the world. really.,5
looks like  down stairs manger was very rude. foods was changed to (small portion) it was ok last year...but they don't use msg...so i 'll definitely go again someday.,2
great place to eat. best vietnamese ive eaten so far in central london.  nice atmosphere inside and good view if you sit by there window. can get busy and may need to wait for table. but worth it.,5
very busy vietnamese restaurant in chinatown. the food is above average with decent portion.,4
"great tasting food and cocktails, very fun atmosphere and a lot better service than other restaurants in the area. would definitely recommend the lemongrass chicken.",5
right on the edge of china town viet food has a good selection of vietnamese dishes. great decor spread over 3 floors and very attentive staff.,4
"great food, excellent atmosphere. the staff is a bit pushy as there is a huge demand, so when you are done, they will try to get you out. this place is not ideal for groups.",4
"great food and service! we ordered the vietnamese pancake, beef pho, and shrimp spring rolls - everything was delicious and fresh.",5
the broth of the pho really tasted of nothing. which is a shame. the calamari was chewy and there were four pieces for five pounds. come on... you must be joking,2
"5 stars to the bar upstairs and the amazing cocktails prepared. the atmosphere is so intimate and cool. the bartenders are really there to listen and to create something amazing, just for you! 4 stars for the food. the curry and soup i had were tasty, but a bit overpriced.",5
tasty comfort food at decent prices,4
they serve very delicious food and the restaurant is very busy.,4
food is excellent... the variety of dishes is great and the flavours in the food is amazing,5
"amazing ! i am  a vietnamese food junky ! everywhere i go, i eat vietnamese! i was in london a couple of weeks ago with my wife and we order appetizers and main dishes and our surprise was great when we found out that my pork bum cha (vermicelli noodles) at vietfood is probably the best i tried !!! loved it",5
"staff are friendly, the taste of beef pho is just so so and too little pieces of beef. the taste of morning glory with shrimp paste is good though.",3
"a polished, modern take on vietnamese street-food fare, served in a bi-level, casually chic setting.",5
delicious pho in the heart of central london. try the cocktails too!,5
"really good food, nice cocktails. i tried the pho and some beef that was really good",5
"great vietnamese food, one of my favourites along with cay tre!",4
"the broth was good but the pho was mainly rice noodles and a very few pieces of meat. i tasted good but a bit washed out, made for international guests. not a authentic vietnamese place.",3
"a very nice restaurant, authentic, good quality food and delicious. the service is very friendly and efficient. will recommend to take several dishes on the table to share, as a portions are not big and also you'll have the chance to taste all the flavors.enjoy :)",4
beautiful vietnamese food. fresh and delicious.,5
little bit food and less expensive in my opinion,4
food was ok. though dishes are a lot smaller than presented in the menu.seems like the restaurant tries to save on the amount of shrimps/fish/meet being served.the vegetarian soup was great.service is the biggest down side. waiter was so rude and unprofessional.,3
this restaurant serves us a nice vietnamese food with chopsticks which brings nostalgia our east asian culture. one of the best vietnamese food in london we can get. you need to try homemade fried prawn rice.,5
delicious!! we didn't have a reservation but they looked after us with no hesitation. the cocktails are amazing and the food is very tasty. would definitely recommend making a reservation if you're planning to visit. otherwise when we left there was a bit of a queue.,5
authentic chinese food in no-frills environment. chinese food as chinese food has to be. good service.,4
"really nice dim sum, and not over the top pricing.  small but is a perfect place to stop for a quick bite while in london as a tourist or a dinner break.",4
"this place has like 4 floors in total. the food is always good, range from dim sum, dinner or just a bowl of noddles for a quick meal. the service is good, it can be a bit slow when is busy. however this is the case for all restaurants in chinatown. price is considered not expensive.",4
great place for dim sum. it's mostly chinese families enjoying morning yum cha. staff were efficient and friendly. food was great and there were a few dim sum items i hadn't seen elsewhere.,4
very good dim sum and efficient service,4

really decent chinese food for this part of town,5
great food at reasonable cost,5

i've been eating here for over 20 years always fantastic,5
with the help of chinese and cantonese friends i was introduced to a much more authentic dim sum experience. who knew chicken feet were so delicious!? service was fast and the food excellent value!,5
poor service and average food. everything was just salty.,1
very limited options for vegetarians hence the reason for lower rating. staff are friendly and accommodating. the food was decent though but not sure i'll come back again.,3
"awesome food, very busy, but worth the wait!",5
the roast pork and steamed rice was below par. the pork was not sweet. the sauce was just plain soy sauce and very watery. the duck was few and fatty. distincy lack of effort in the dish. however the service is quick and efficent the food is not the best.,3
lovely meal. friendly place,5

"fast, cheap, decent quality. just the way chinatown dim sum should be.",5
"like its sister restaurant, hungs on wardour street, wan chai specialises in old school cantonese cuisine. everything on the menu including dim sum is worth trying especially the prawn dumplings and roast meats. the service, for chinatown, is actually decent and friendly.",4
top quality each time and good portion sizes and excellent customer service.,5
excellent chinese go with friends every two to three months,4

terrible old pak choi with no sauce and the green bits were cut off. stale beancurd and overcooked bad aubergine. the sizzling prawns were very few and the peking duck looked like cut up worms atrociousbibi,1

"while visiting london i had the opportunity to enjoy lunch at this place. i had the sweet-and-sour chicken with some green tea, and it was one of my better food experiences in england.it was relatively small but comfortable, and we enjoyed a good service.",4
"we always come to this place.the food is good and the price isreasonable .but today as we are making our order the waiter is very rude and impatient.i can understand if hes tired,but that doesnt give you reason to be rude.",1
i love a bit of dim sum and living in leeds we have little options on where to get it. im not convinced that this is world class but it was still very tasty.the highlight were the prawn and xhive dumplings.i would recomend this for dim sum. i cant comment to the rest of the food but the roast meats looked amazing.,4
extremely rude waiter swear at us and almost fight break out. avoid this place at all cost or otherwise you will be treated like a criminal. the most horrible restaurant i ever been in london.,1
the service was quick and the food was yummy.,4
really great food.,5
nice food but service is really bad. the waitres are really rude. we ordered dim sum but they never told us there will be minimum quantity for theorder. good food but too bad the experience was reduced because of the bad service.,3
service is excellent. roast duck tastes really nice,4
"i simply can't praise this place enough, mainly for dim sum. went there again twice, and again good quality, speedy service (the portly chief waiter is a full pro), great selection and competitive prices indeed. simply can't figure why some people are so critical.",5
"very polite, great service! and the staff even helped us pack up all the unfinished food when we were paying the bill - at no extra charge for the take-away boxes and no compulsory service charge.",5
great food and reasonably priced. would recommend.,5
fast service and nice food.,5
my first time to this chinese restaurant in london. their staffs are exceptionally friendly and nice unlike other typical chinese restaurants in chinatown. descent food at reasonable price. thumbs up to ken and wayne,5
amazing service from the staff and great authentic dim sum. i was feeling like i was back in hong kong!i highly recommend the jan jyu gai (pearl chicken) which was moist and tasty. also the shrimp fan cheung was great with plenty of shrimps! this place is definately worth another visit.,5
the foods are definitely authentic hong kong style and tasty. the portions are large and price is reasonable relative to the other restaurants in chinatown. the only thing could be improved is the cleaning of the floor.,4
"went for dim sum and noodles, the siu mai was a particular stand out. chunks of prawn and a great flavour. the mixed meat and seafood chow mein was better than the seafood ho fun.",4
"the food was ok a bit expensive but the rudest waiter i have ever seen in my life, he got into an argument with another lady customer in chinese and started shouting at her and then just took the plate of food in front of her and threw it in the bin and kicked her out",1
very quick service the good was very very tastu plenty of space upstairs  but extremely pricey . i have been here before and i will return,4
"overpriced food, a 9 dish is like 16 in there...",2
delicious food and really lovely staff and service!! takeaway options available.good quality ingredients ,5
"4 stars as was above my expectations (coming from hong kong) good yum cha, good service decent price for london but still expensive",4
good food with reasonable price,4
"one of the best chinese meals i have had, friendly, good service and reasonable prices",5
the best little restaurant in chinatown x,5
great dim sum restaurant,4
my place for a quick chinese meal. dim sums are good and so are the roasts. it also has a good range of special dishes too.,4
best dumplings ever!,5
"authentic taste, good prices, decent portions. even the service is so authentic that sometimes they may not be the nicest but they are definitely efficient. i have been going back for times.",5
worst chinese food i have ever tasted! questioned an item on the bill and got called stupid by a waiter which then lead to a fight breaking out in the restaurant between waiters. would leave a zero star review if possible; avoid at all costs,1
great food and reasonably priced!,5
"pretty quick service, good food and reasonable portions",4
"good service ,food okay.",3
"great food, i recommend it for lunch. i also went once for dinner, which was a bit disappointing.",4

"my favourite dim sum place in town!! i love wan chai corner! authentic cantonese food! try the yam dim sum, egg yolk custard bun, bifun and prawn/chive dim sum its the food that matters, manage your expectation for other things such as service, toilets, etc. though i think wan chais pretty decent in those other areas too.",5
far the best for dim sum - arrive early!,5

great food and service,5
currently the best  and cheapest  chinese  restaurant in london,4

enjoyed every mouthful of this freshly cooked dinner. would return as so good.,5
no doubt about service. door guy give me a nice view 4 sitting. if youre dim sum lover and like to hop around the world to try which one is the best dim sum. well! medium dim sum - great service & price. u need to try.,4
"loved it. the food is amazing and with big portions, staff is very friendly. totally recommend this place",5
so goodmust visit againchick feet is too spicy though....,4
"nowadays we always eat here when we are in chinatown so that speaks for the food, value and service. there are 2 upper floors which are probably more relaxed than downstairs.",4
"i have been here for many times, the experience is always good. not all of the food in the dim sum menu are good, but generally worth to try with the fair price. the manager and the waiters are quick to serve and super friendly to you. the best in chinatown!",5
great affordable chinese restaurant. service attentive and quick,5
"super busy at lunchtime, you will probably have to share a table. huge selection of dim sum. our meal arrived quickly considering how busy it was. food was hot and tasty. i will be back.",4
"great food, we had a set seafood meal and it was one of the best chinese meals i've had in the uk. service was very quick and efficient, friendly for china town restaurants as well. definitely one of the best in the area",5

"staff were very child friendly, very courteous. very fast service. food was gorgeous. we will definitely be going back",5
this is the worst chinese restaurant ive ever been to. very rude staff. overly greasy food. i will never make the mistake of coming here again.,1
tiny portions. we ordered the fried fish in cream corn sauce and there was barely any fish..all deep fried batter. food generally lacked flavour. will not return.,2
"great food, good price and quick service. probably the best restaurant in chinatown for price and taste.",5
"traditional chinese restaurant, good quality for yum cha",5
the restaurant is a little shabby inside but the food was great and very friendly service,4
a very good restaurant and it gets 5 stars from me because the food was great and the service was excellent. a unique restaurant as it is set on a few floors. ,5
good food and quick service. good value,5
lovely dim sum and one of the busiest restaurants in the road. one of the only ones that you have to queue for.the service is quick and enficent. food is so tasty.. but mega busy...,5
food here is good. the service is good. lots of options. tastes like a hong kong style cafe. would come again and again.,5
"poor service, staff shouting at each other. setting up tables sounded like a warzone. stingy with condiments. expecting tips. food was okay, but i would definitely recommend going somewhere else.",1
we had good stir-fried noodles and vegetables but the roast duck wasn't up to standard. it was fatty and not so much meet.,3
hung up on me 3 times when i was trying to book a table - rubbish service.,1
"authentic, but below average food while it is very expensive and they charge a 10% service fee.",2
i love this place.. friendly staff. i personally feel that wan chai corner provides the best customer service for a chinese restaurant in china town..prices are reasonable and food is good.. i would highly recommend the dim sum..,5
great classic chinese cuisine with a varied selection of dim sums. includes the obligatory rude yet efficient chinese customer service.,4
"quite surprised by the quality and authenticity of the domain dishes, for a place that hasn't been a dimsum restaurant. will visit again for sure.",4
"nice and reasonably priced dimsum in the afternoon. there are quite a lot of seatings too, so we didn't have to wait for that long.",5
excellent chinese food,4
"fatty food that is for hours in the kitchen, noodles overcooked, unfriendly service. never again",1
"they serve down to earth asian cuisine - wanton soup, yang zhou fried rice, sweet and sour fish with rice, and stir fried noodles.had a great chat with the waiters and waitresses.",4
"excellent food with authentic mandarin chinese service. frequently busy, but adds to the atmosphere and indicates the fact that it's a very popular restaurant. i would highly recommend the dim sum, hoisin duck and the delicious banana toffee dessert.",5
"complete rip-off. rice box with roast pork takeaway cost 9.30 when everywhere else is 7. they are buying from another kitchen as they don't have the expertise.. packed with rice, and the meat isn't great. this also explains why their sauce is an unauthentic gravy and bland. don't bother imo.",1
absolutely amazing. dim sum was best i have every had. vermicelli singapore noodles...so tasty. unfortunately i didn't take any pictures to share. i would 100% be going back here very soon.,5
"quick service, excellent food, friendly staff that tries to seat people as quickly as they can. if there's a wait, it's worth it!",5
food and service was amazing,4

excellent place to eat! great service and friendly staff too!,5
"oh. my. god. sooo good. it comes in threes, so go in groups of 3 and split it, you can get a massive amount of food totally reasonably priced.",5
my fave dim sum place in town. went with 8 friends and had lovely meal,5
"low quality dim sum. char siew bao, egg yolk buns, congee are disappointing. expensive, baby booster seat were filthy!. waste of money!",1
great food at reasonable prices. the lamb curry is exceptional.,5
good service and incredible food. with a large table the food kept coming with plates being replaced whenever there was space. attentive servers.,4
absolutely good food and dim sum. excellent waiter service. competitive and inexpensive prices.,5
"overall a nice experience - the food was tasty, but the service could have been friendlier.",4
"easily one of the worst dim sum i've ever had...really greasy and limited vegetarian options (for my company), also, the waiter couldn't be bothered to return my 5 change...even though they charge table service on top of the bill...",1
"the food was amazing, very tasty and cheap, with a lot of good options in the menu to choose those are completely affordable, like the pecking duck which was very good.",5
excellent food and pretty good service. would definitely visit again!,5
bit pricey. i would avoid buying side rice next time as it was 6 pounds. other than that food is great and so is service!,4
best dim sum i've had in the city. very polite staff willing to help. and an amazing selection of food on offer. would recommend always,5
"it's a nice place. for two people eating it cost 76, but one of the dishes was the scallops and that alone for just two very small scallops was 10.40.",4
absaloutly brilliant food great with the family would recommend the bbq meats which are freshly hung near the window to show. i know its a bold statement but multiple members of my family all agreed that it was the best chinese food they have tried in china town!,5
"nice hong kong style chinese restaurants, serving cantonese food.",5
good value for money.,4
i have been here a few times and found the food very tasty and freshly prepared as well as being reasonably priced drink menu limited but fine for the place the staff are chinese so don't expect too much but seem reasonably polite and knowledgeable it is worth a visit and see for your self very well positioned in china town,4
"excellent dim sum, wonderful",5
yummy dim sum! in the heart of china town. we arrived early for lunch; when we left there was a long queue outside of the door.,5
this place has 3 floors dining area. we were put to the top floor and the waiters there were all very nice. the prices were slightly higher than some chinese restaurants. we found the food has more homemade style taste.,3
great dim sum expensive for beer.,5
nice intimate dinner experience unlike the other big restaurants. dim sum was delicious and service was good,4
"good food and well looked after, including 2 small children, for a good price.",5
excellent for value for money on dim sum,5
this is a proper chinese food place. the peking duck set menu was perfect for the first meal staying in the area as everything you read about the expedient service is absolutely true. you will get you food and service very fast but you'll eat great. this place is a good choice.,4
very good food. the set meals have very generous portions. for normal eaters two set meals will be enough for four. but you can always take away what you can't finish. i recommend the lobster menu.,4
rude staff. dirty restaurant. walked out before i ordered any food,1
fabulous the duck and pork crispy noodles to die for yummy yummy  plus the dim sum,5
"not the best or the cheapest. we ordered 7 dim sums, 5 of them were below standard, not homemade and not very fresh. the other 2 and service are good. won't return again. fyi we are native from hong kong.",2
"the staff was great, fast service and big portions... but the food wasn't nice. its flavour wasn't good or just tasteless . they need a better cook. it's rather xpensive too.",2
chinese food as you'd expect. good service. hospitable and accommodating to a large group of 7 of us with no booking. will return.,4
brilliant dim sum and very reasonable prices.. friendly and helpful staff.. brst place i know i'm chinatown for lunch..,5
the service was quick but food was tasteless and ordered a second dish which was not nice. staff rude and disinterested.  not recommend.,1
great experience. we thought we'd follow a family tradition on the chinese side but it was our first time alone!,5
really nice authentic chinese restaurant. the dim sum taste really great.,5
"good dim sum and roast duck, my go to when im in china town.",4
we came in as they just opened so had to wait a bit long for the food. the waiter did warn us in advance so we didn't mind. after that the service was good and fast. the dim sum was tasty and fresh. we enjoyed every single dish ordered. would definitely come again.,5
one of the best restaurant in chinatown! you must try a duck here :),5
probably my favourite dim sum place in china town,5
"lived in hong kong for many years and this was a treat finding this restaurant in london, amazing dim sum, same about the huge fight outside restaurant staff were very professional and will definitely return",5
"been eating at this place for a long time... great dim sum, noodles and chinese dishes!",5
always busy with a long waiting queue at the entrance it is a good sign for good food i mainly eat dim sum at wan chai corner with my family. yummy,4
"we like this placeand go back time and again for their excellent dim sum. service is prompt, friendly and helpful, unlike many of their surly neighbours.",4
excellent dim sum,5
"awesome restaurant in chinatown. i love crispy noodles with mix of meat and seafood, big plates, jasmin tea, tripe soup, crispy pork belly , etc etc., good service, very professional",5
walked in today looking for a quick dumpling stop and we were not disappointed! cheung fun with beef was particularly tasty. definitely would return if i am in the area! great flavours in all dishes we tried.,4
definitely has the best customer service in chinatown. very nice and friendly staff. authentic delicious cantonese dim sum at very reasonable price. we are regular customers and the food quality is very consistent. highly recommend,5
"when i ate the food here, i felt back to china and felt familiar. i would like to recommend stir fried ho fun with beef to you mix 2 roast meats with steamed rice  is also greatevery staffs here are so nice",5
very good service. food came pretty quickly (in a good way). taste is just like hong kong. owner was also very kind to offer some roast duck sauce to take away when i requested. will definitely come back for more authentic cantonese dishes!,5
"fantastic, authentic chinese dim sum. full of flavour. good service but expect to queue a bit. they do work hard to seat you quickly.",5
incredible dim sum and excellent service.  this is the best tea house in london chinatown.  didn't take too long to get a table even during busy weekend lunch hours.  food is freshly made as you order and promptly served.  would recommend!,5
"awesome food, loads of it. fast service. really happy we ate here.",5
i have eaten at this restaurant on and off for 30 years and think it offers very authentic and good quality chinese food at reasonable prices. thoroughly recommend.,5
"if you want chinese for dinner, consider somewhere else. too salty and i bet there are spoons of msg, my tongue feel numbed after the dinner. service is alright but one of the guy does not let me put my suitcase beneath the table even though this area is known to have pick pocket.",1
"had a really yummy beef ho fun and salt and pepper shrimp. really good simple cantonese food, but fairly expensive considering the dishes weren't huge. 15.80 for the prawns, and 12 for the noodles. still yummy.",4
pretty authentic cantonese dim sum restaurant.  price is quite reasonable.  a very popular restaurant and most likely you have to wait for a table,5
great value. good range of options on the menu. delicious food.,5
used to always come here but today's experience was terrible. i ordered a portion of roast pork to takeaway but there was barely any meat. around 70% of the pieces were all just fat. wasted 11 on just fat. won't be coming back,2
been going here over 10years now and it's the only place i get dim sum from amazing,5
"a disappointing experience.quick service, huge portions but that doesnt make up for the lack of flavors. the spicy aubergine hotpot barely even registered a shiver (in spice as in taste). even the rice was not up to the expectations of a chinese restaurant.",3
late night eatery and good to go get some chinese food after a large night out.  better equality can be had elsewhere but if you want something quick and open all good this is a good choice.  portion sizes are large and is reflected in the proce.  get the rice congee it's big enough to feed three people!,3
great dim sum at good value. sometimes you have to wait to get a seat but its worth it!,5
best chinese restaurant in whole of chinatown,5
"delicious dim sum, would go back and order the whole menu :)",5
very good place with great food for a good price.,5
"nothing special. think it's changed hands or changed it's attitude to dim sum recently. we went last weekend, there were very few items, many items shown in pics on this restaurant are no longer available (eg siao long bao). since closure of new world, we have been looking for another good dim sum place, and this is not it.",2
"me and my friend we are 3 ordered 8 dishes(without drinks), all taste good and we paid less than 11. highly recommended!!!",4
best dim sum and peking duck. the service was fast and friendly.,5
very nice chinese restaurant in the heart of london. food was amazing and the service was good. the prices are also reasonable with respect to central london.,5
it was soso!! not bad!! not good!!,3
real chinese food. great dim sum. it's a place to go if you want to eat in a friendly environment. try it and let me know...,4
food was no doubt amazing ! but a lady was a little un professional. also its 10 min per person.,4
great atmosphere!,5
"nice, but dead when we went",5
unusual pub with very wide choice of drinks,5
love it.will always will,5
fun place in the heart of london. love going here every now and then. good selection of drinks. huge place so you should be able to find a spot somewhere even if it's busy.,5

"love this pub, went for work christmas lunch, was very reasonable lunch great value for what you got included, staff bit 'missing' at first to seat us and bring drinks but made up for it later. really cool decor and loads of floors and places to sit",5

great atmosphere and authentic irish drinks and food. one of the best central london bars,5
"great decor, friendly staff and nice environment. can get very busy so get there early. music was epic. despite the business we got served at the bar really quickly",5
loads of charm.  sadly a bit dark inside but that may be ok in the long winters,4
guinness on tap and a friendly staff. decorum was very cool.,4
"enormous quirky bar, good service and atmosphere. very big to be called a pub, more like a club, security etc nonetheless no stress no mess!",5
"the place is just amazing inside, i cannot fault it and i would rate it at 5 stars if the burger which i had was at least decent. but it wasn't even that, it was tasteless and scorched on both sides the same as the pulled pork which came with it. i would definitely come back for a drink but not for food.",1
"i always loved the decor of waxy o'connor's...reminds me of church, irish pine and cave like... unfortunately...they did disappoint me this visit by hugging too many flags + even inflatable rugby balloon... i just hope "" sports bar "" look to go from it.",3
the best and the nicest irish pub in the world!!!!!,5
"im always amazed bu the layout of this place. it keeps going and going on different levels, each with its own bar. great atmosphere, especially in the days with live music.",5
"definitely a place to see when you are visiting london. there is just something about the place - the way it stands out from the rest of the pubs, is certainly something, that makes it interesting. you should be sure to check it out, if you are going out for dinner or just checking out pubs in the city.",5

"one of the best in london. cool vibe, nice music, unique interior creating the perfect mood",5
"super fun irish pub! problemos: sometimes the music is usually too loud to have a proper conversation with a big table of people, even just afternoon/early evening. food is so so, but the selection of beers is great and deals are gucci",3
way cool place for an irish bar down a si de e street in the middle of the times square of london... cheap...good beer and irish whiskey and music.,5
"feels a bit too commercialised, lots of tourists",3
"beautiful downtown bar, feels like hobbiton.  staff is great, beers are well varied, music is good if a bit loud, so might be a good idea to have silence between musicians so wendon't have to shout all the time.",5

"good selection of beers and helpful, friendly staff in this pub that seems to have been a fixture in the west end for years.  liked the camden pale ale particularly.  it's deceptively large and seems to have lots of rooms and levels, but that might have been the effects of the camden pale ale....",4
"waxy o'connor's is a very cool place. this pub is gigantic and kind of a maze. it's a nice place to go, but the heating is on way too high in this pub. the food was pretty tasty although we didn't order too much. i would definitely go back to have a few drinks.",4

massively overrated tourist trap. waxys little sister across the road is better but even that is over crowded and expensive. the door staff and bar staff are rude. the wooden decor is nice though.,2

one of the best places to have a drink in the west end.  the bar staff are great. always enjoy going there,5
"perfect guinness in london. well poured and great bartenders overall. food was decent, but i would say the atmosphere makes up for the decent food. multiple levels and i would recommend heading straight down to back bar. interior decoration is well done, music is fun and upbeat... one of the best guinness i have had in london so far.",5

great as always. nice selection of beers on tap and lovely people,5

great to place to have a guiness,5
one of the best places to meet with your friends. the decoration is very nice and the environment too.the price of the drinks is not cheap but it is understandable keeping in mind their location. did not give 5 starts because i couldn't find a place to seat down due to the lack of chairs.,4

really great !! live music and happy people.,5
"unique experience of a huge tree in the middle of the bar and its deceptively huge inside. only downside is the mammoth trek into the belly of the venue makes it inconvenient for smokers. as the bulk of the bar is ""below ground"" there is also no natural light which may not be ideal for some.",3
good fun with live music,5
we had a lot of fun in the pub. the burguer was tasty. it is a great place to meet with friends and chat.,5

it reminds me of my highly waxy little sister. so much wax! 10/10 would wax again.,5

"nice cosy pub just off leicester square. prices for drinks very reasonable for london and its location in the heart of tourist land, close to china town, cinemas, theatres and public transport.",4
"nothing special, over priced, and the staff are clearly sick of dealing with drunk londoners. after watching both bartenders and the bouncer be rude and obnoxious to a small group of friendly drunks i have to wonder if they realise that they are the ones in the business of selling them alcohol?",2

nice little pub with an open fire,5
proper well run pub,5
"last night, me and my 4 friends were not allowed to get in by the bouncer because we weren't bringing any woman with us. frankly, this kind of behavior in these times is absolutely unacceptable and disgraceful.",1
typical irish pub export - lookss like an old pub but no atmosphere pleasant staff but not enough of them therefore service slow. drinks nothing to write home about - should have gone to wetherspoons.,2
music way to loud for 3 o'clock in the afternoon,3
good pint,4
good atmosphere,4
very crowded but nice pub. great views on chinatown from upstairs as well as nice decor. good selection of beverages. you can order something on the ground floor and ask to be sent up via special lift!,4
"apart from a strange name, it pretty much does what every other pub in the area does: fuel the frantic paced boozing of tourists and out of towners in for a  big  night on the town.",3
great staff!,5
bit sticky but good music and drinks,4
"nice bar, food comes over from waxy o'connors. burger was dry but the fish and chips was decent, and drinks are fairly priced.",3
lovely little spot in the centre of london,3
swiss clock outside! ,4

good pub in the heart of china town,5
"not a  bad pub, need to offer easier and quicker food when drinking",3
the place is good,5
lovely vibe,5
barman with the beard is so full of attitude and rude the party of 16 that i'm with have left and gone elsewhere. lovely pub terrible customer service. upsetting during the festive period just because this one member of staff is hideous,1
nice little pub.,3
great irish bar and the beautiful irish barmaid was a bonus,5
"one of the few london pubs i return to.there's a beer lift upstairs - a dumb waiter to the bar below where you send your order down with cash and receive beers back. brilliant!nice cosy sofas upstairs by the fire. perfect in winter,",5
"love this place on a saturday afternoon. right in chinatown with a nice view our the upper floor window, and a lift for sending up/ordering drinks. comfy sofas too!",5
great pub in china town.  love the decor and drinks lift is so much fun !,4
amazing place,5
it's ok wifi is very poor have to sit down at the front door to get it,3
didn't actually manage to squeeze inside,5
my favourite pub in china town.  very unique ambience.  very lovely interior.  the first floor is great to chill out and the lazy waiter will make your beer taste even better.,5
"mixers in drinks were watery,  drinks tasted horrible.",1
cool pub that was playing solid tunes. has more seating upstairs and a fire place. it was dead when i went. which wasn't a bad thing. ,5
"nice warm fireplace, cute ancient little lift will take your beers upstairs so u don't need to worry about carrying your beer to the fireplace upstairs woo",5
the sofa gallery upstairs is great. many comfy places to sit and coffee tables for your drinks. with a good view of one of chinatown's gate. ,5
"perfect dynamic of niche and commercial music (find somewhere else in this area that plays nirvana) friendly staff, good mixup of beer that changes more or less weekly. my kinda place",5
very good place!,5
"great little pub in chinatown, when it isn't packed it is much better! the dumb waiter is a great novelty.",4
great pub. lovely staffs.,5
it's small but it's great when you want a quieter place where you can hear one another.,4
dont know much about it,4
"one of my favourite central london pubs. i generally avoid drinking in the area, but if have to then can recommend this place. get yourself upstairs and you may even be able to get that rarest of things .. a seat in a good central london pub!",4
awesome place with a dumbwaiter in the middle. no need to walk up and down stairs for drinks... place your order and cash in the dumb waiter... pull the ropes... then wait for your drinks to arrive!,5
well-thought decor is what strikes the most. choice of beer is simple and mainstream like all bar one with a few exceptions worth of porter house. perfect for a quick drink.,3
poor service!!!!,1
like they dimsum,4
"variety of snack, hello kitty candy with toys, rabbit candy its like a milk candy, hello panda snack is availiable there",3
love the green tea moon cake,4
the old wife cake has mildew on it. similar to when bread goes stale.,1
rubbishhow long have you had your cake?the cake is mildewed and soldi don't want to give a star. my comments just make more people see what the store looks like,1
it has all the good stuff you'd find in a shop in hong kong,4
"bought a black forest cake with strawberry on top. when i got home my excited son took the strawberry only to find out it has molds underneath it. good thing i was it before he ate it, otherwise he could have been sick this christmas. very disappointing as for the price i was expecting they'd sell fresh cakes",1
a nice selection but sadly the bakes were poorly executed,2
"it's a large chinese cake shop (with  an anglo/french name) and they sell all manner of chinese cakes and pastries. sweet and savoury.the coconut finger thing was nice, as was the sausage bun. they have loads of different varieties and some quite unusual variations. worth a visit.",3
the only place in chinatown that sells kiki noodles. breads and cakes selections are really nice. the pineapple cakes are great. i have also bought  from them before and it was moist and the fillings are generous. the staff are all much friendlier than most other places in chinatown. very helpful and not rushing customers.,5
addicted to pandan cake! good prices and lots of treats to choose from.,5
"their tiger rolls are beautifully made, just a bit pricey",4
"jackie harryman, that was not custard tarts, but egg tarts, very popular in hong kong and in any chinatown around the world! they are very delicious! i love them!",5
really nice pastries there,4
amazing food and pastries..,5
the location of the bakery is perfect. hower the quality of the food is not good enough. it's a cheap bakery ,3
"surprised by the negative reviews below. i've been to this bakery twice and have been very happy with everything---the green tea cake with red bean is so tasty that it has become my standard breakfast. the young sales person there is very polite, helpful and patient with me when i wanted to exchange the cake for another one.",5
"really bad quality cakes, and even worse staff. they are all very rude and very unhelpful. the smallest request, such as a carrier bag, seemed liked an enormous chore and stroppy staff. will never return. avoid at all costs!! the cakes are extremely awful as well!!!!!! avoid",1
"awful awful cake....bought a cheesecake this afternoon. i only had a small slice and i was sick pretty much within 10 minutes, vomiting and upset tummy, awful cramp",1
"a large variety of chinese baked goods. the quality is good, fresh, and relatively cheap. try out the lotus and green tea buns or their famous moon cakes. ",5
"they used to do a larger selection of pastries. the green tea and taro  pastries are nice, as are their char siu baos. this is the only chinese bakery in chinatown that do natas",3
"had a ""sausage hawaiian"" bun from here - delicious!",4
tasty chinese patisserie different to european style.,4
"lovely food for lovely price. for me,pensioner it's helpful.",5
"we went there after christmas time, and to be honest we found the staffs attitude are actually ok. i think its a typical eat and go place to have a faster turn over and the price is really cheap and the food is yummy.",4
one of my favourite restaurants quick no hassle it's like a a take out but you can sit in and eat and enjoy i suggest drink the green tea it's fantastic,4
the waiters don't take no bs. instead they serve great food at a reasonable price.,5
"if you wanted a quick lunch, they might put you with a stranger on a two-people table, which was a bit awkward. luckily i found a seat at the long tables. cash only. delicious, authentic food for a nice price.",4
they serve the most amazing chinese food in china town/ leicester square. always keep craving for more. reasonable prices and portions are also good. can be very busy during rush hours though,5
their crispy pork and duc on rice is legendary. stomach filling on a winter's evening in a central london.,4
"an institution. fantastic food, really bargain prices. been coming here for 30+ years.",5
"been coming here for 30 years, it's an institution and it never disappoints!",5
"honestly, amongst the worst service you can expect at a restaurant. its the most consistent thing about the restaurant. the food is cheap but very average and really not worth the poor and very rude service.",2
food was quite nice and service was quick. waiters however were really rude and disrespectful. between 1 & 4 o'clock is when the place has a queue out the door and it's very noisy and crowded,3
iconic. great food . portion n decent prices. not as rude as before.,5
"20years i have been coming to wong key and still my favorite chinese.""u here to look or u here to eat?""no point arguing about the sitting arrangements just sit and enjoy the food!",5
"it's like being on the set of big trouble in little china. the food is fantastic, and very reasonably priced. the staff are hilarious, they stayed in character the whole time",5
i had a roast duck noodle soup which i really enjoy despite it being more bone than duck. we also felt really squashed as the tables were close together. but other than that i really recommend this place and the staff were nice and food was cheap.,3
"brusque would be okay if the service was faster. the food was fine but we still managed to spend 30 on a meal for two, i feel that we could have eaten cheaper, better and friendlier elsewhere.",1
love the place if your hungry and like to eat chinese food then that's the place roast duck and crispy pork are the best dishes. good prices so the people that write bad reviews should not go there book yourself somewhere and pay double the price. for me it's good quality food that's cheap.,5
"never disappoints this amazing chinese. food is always delicious, reasonably priced and speedy. the only drawback is that it is cash only. don't be put off by the appearance.",5
"possibly the worst restaurant in london. but, it's renowned for that. treat this more as a museum for terrible customer service and it's actually the best, most authentic attraction in london. much love.",1
"for singapore fried noodles, sweet and sour chicken - this place hits the spot. it won't hurt the pocket and tastes good! as a rule of thumb: if you see plenty of chinese people eat in a place and ""slapping the food back"", you know it is a winner.it is all about order quick, nyaam your food and kick out!",5
i love this place. food is full of flavour and excellent value. don't be surprised if you get put on a table with people you don't know.,5
"fast service without any fuss, the food is great and is in large proportions - i couldn't finish mine & they kindly brought a takeaway box to put it in. although, bear in mind if you're going as 2-3 people, there's a high likelyhood you'll be seated on a table with strangers",5
"very much improved on previous times. staff polite enough, service quite quick and food reasonable. even toilets clean!",4
i can't remember ever going to a restaurant where the staff are so rude and the service is non existent. i felt they just wanted to take the money and get rid of us. the food however is value for money,1
"you've just had a night out in town, you're hungry, you wanna eat now, no nonsense just serve up... well you can share a table and get your food quickly. service? what service? that's why it's not added! notorious for the lack of service but that's the selling point. have to add the food wasn't bad either.",3
"it's not that pricey. the food is fine. however, the service is not yet on point.",3
tasty but i expect some veggies._.the sauce tastes like japanese style.meat and rice perfect!,4
always love the service here it's part of the fun. you gotta be firm with them! the best on chinatown!,5
"really great food.really fast and efficient serviceunderstaffed so you need to be quick to order.don't eat the red stuff in the middle of the table, it will blow your nose off.really great value.",5
"cheap food, tasty. be warned the staff are not there to offer you service. theyll dump you on a table, sling some tea at you, take your order and bring you food. no messing about. if you want a decent feed at a good price without pretences then this place is for you. if you want high dining and attentiveness then dont bother.",5
very good restaurant with cheap food but also delicious. the only issue is you are paired with strangers on a table and obviously you cant talk about private information or they can also be loud and annoying. (a woman was talking about diarrhoea while we were eating so imagine),3
"the food isn't the greatest but it isn't the greatest anywhere in chinatown. the price is very good though, and it has a system where you can eat on your own without any social stigma or embarrassment, something that is popular, lucrative and famous!",5
staff no sense of humourfood okdrinks expensive,2
roast duck noodle soup..favourite soup of all time..been having this soap from day 1 ,5
shed any expectations of a fancy restaurant and consider the price you're paying and you'll enjoy it. a fast food experience rather than leisurely dining.,5
"good food, sopa de pato with wan tan and noodles is delicious!",5
"my favourite central london chinese restaurant since 1996. rude waiters and shared tables are main features of this place, where food is fresh, very good and very cheap. crispy pork rice, singapore fried noodles and all soups are my favourites!",5
"300upstairs""downstairs",4
"price is good for the portions you get, cash only though",4
1st class service,5
best chinese resturant in london- have been going for 30 years!,5
cheap and nasty. plenty of better places to eat. avoid,1
very good for singletons who get to sit on the ground floor. in and out tasty fast food with good portions but staff extremely unfriendly,3
a pale imitation of what it used to be,1
shouting,4
good food and good price,4
terrible customer service.,1
staff was very rude,2
excellent food at good prices,4
"cheap, food is decent considering price. service is swift - can't go wrong",4
the worst service i've ever experienced in a restaurant. would go again.,5
staff very rude .,1
got more expensive over the years,3
this is the worst restaurant. the staffs were incredibly rude to customers and the experience in this restaurant was absolutely horrendous. never come again.#rudeness #disappointed,1
the bestest chinese authentic taste ever you could have in london.,5
"favourite chinese, food good, free tea, reasonable prices",4
"really good food, and much cheaper than the other chinatown restaurants i've been to.",5
staff not as rude as they used to be. a shame since that was the unique selling point when i started going there in the late 1980s. it was funny - a quirky experience known shared by many diners. food still as tasty and quick as ever though.,5
efficient & fast service ! nice food ! cheap price !,5
good potion! very good cantonese dishes.,5
famous for amazing food & entertainingly bad service. don't come here to be treated like an emperor. come for the fast food & the rude staff. it's fantastic.,5
"great food, good service, reasonable prices. cash only, but not a problem",5
best placeaffordable and good,5
great traditional place dunno why i kept visiting over many years. it's few remaining cantonese authentic food,4
very nice...... good customer service and delicious meal,5
the best won ton soup and singapore noodles i have ever eaten anywhere. i have visited this wonderful restaurant more than a thousand times since 1977 and it never disappoints.,5
"the waitress was sooooo rude to us!! just asked for a tissue and she raised her voice. also that sour face shes showing us definitely took away my appetite. didnt enjoy at all, the soup  was too salty, probably too much msg. really impatient waitress, bad service.",1
"i'm giving wong kei 5 stars because the beef brisket noodle soup is always delicious and only costs 5.90 for a bowl (as of august 2019). the service is brisk, the decor is old school. love it.",5
good duck noodle soup. very affordable.,3
very decent hong kong styled wanton noodles. generous portions of the wanton & siew yoke. the dirw yoke is very tasty. noodles are tasty & springy too. all fresh. extremely good value for money. service only average but that's not importsmt in a place like this where you just come in for a quick bite & leave,3
"nice place with awesome food. loved the crispy pork, the sweet & sour chicken, wanton noodle soup and their seafood with criapy noodles. the food takes a bit of a while ti arrive, vut it is definitely worth the wait.",4
"rubbish staff and rubbish restaurant. the only people who likes this place are strange masochists. if you respect yourself even a little, don't visit this place, please.",1
"fast cheap delicious food, don't expect warm service",4
the fried  prawns and rice the best i ever tasted,5
"the food was very tasty, big portions and great value for money. the down side was that they could really do with cleaning up and refurbing the toilets, as they were not in a good way!!",4
a huge dining space in chinatown that is popular with orientals and occidentals. you might have to wait a while to be seated but the food is tasty and reasonably priced.,4
wong kei has been there for 30 plus years. it's as close as you'll get to authentic chinese as you may have once encountered in wan chi. three floors shared tables and load of free china tea. great food great atmosphere and great prices i love it. long may it continue,4
"great food, amazing value, fast service ... its quite easy to consider their manner as rudeness when really they are super efficient!!!",5
looking for awful food combined with poor customer service? you have come to the right place. enjoy!,1
the food is unreal. my first time there tonight won't be my last. can't wait to go back.,5
"relic of a bygone era in dining which i really hope doesn't get swept away by gentrification. come here for for cheap grub and plentiful portions. don't whinge about the abrupt, brisk service; that's all part of the appeal (as is the comically dated decor).oh and bring cash as they're averse to card payments.",5
"i've been in london for ten years and wong kei is undoubtedly my favourite restaurant in london! from my university years to being pregnant, anytime wong kei is my top go-to place. i would travel from kent to wong kei just for the three-meat on rice. strongly recommend!!!!!",5
chinese fast foodvery good and a very reasonable price for london,5
"average quality and quantity, but at an attractive price point!",3
food good. service is basic and sparse depending which floor you are sat on. decor basic. go there if this does not worry you.,3
"good value, decent basic food.",4
"cheap, quick and easy food with a lot of it!! staff are ok, they are starting to make more of an effort, just depends who you get serving you and anyways you're not there for them, it's all about the food! best thing to get is crispy pork belly on cold rice, be prepared for a mountain of meat! ",5
"needed a good lunch fast, got it!",5
"good food, reasonably priced. quick service. watch out though, it's cash only. easy to miss the sign if there are people looking at the window menu. not mentioned inside or on the table menu.",4
"i love this place, my 4th visit was last night. king pao is the best!",5
superb food and great vibe,5
15 years and counting. best chinese food in london.,5
"foods are okay. the service there is really awful, waiters are arrogant. definitely not going again unless the waiters change their attitude and services.",1
"order, eat, pay, go.no faffing about.you are served with a minute of sitting down so know what you want beforehand as staff coming back to you will not be as pleasant a welcome.and their chilli oil, mmm mmmm. lovely stuff.",5
wong kei is the goto chinese 'fast food' palace. if your looking to come here you come for your food and you leave. cash only. staff are their to serve and serve only if you have any dietary requirements you might aswell forgot it as it'll be no help but aside it's great if your looking for a nice quick chinese meal,5
"disgusting food, cold and probably not cooked properly. staff really rude and keeps on talking about customers in an intolerable way. complained to manager but she clearly doesn't care. do not ever eat there, you'll regret it if you do.",1
love the crispy pork from here,4
favourite place for a quick meal in chinatown. great value for money.,5
my favourite chinese restaurant in london. love crispy belly pork on rice.,5
"terrible restaurant, food was not cook properly, very undercooked, very overpriced food for the quality, staff are very rude, i felt very racially objectified with me and my friends as we constantly was get into dirty looks from the staff",1
"price is cheap for chinatown. but today, the rice served was very bad. felt like few days old rice.",1
"very good food, big portions and good prices! the staff was a bit grumpy but it's fine!there are no tables for couples, all of them are at least for 5-7 people!",5
good food eg beancurd&green veg on rice & free tea & functional service,4
"worst customer service ever on this planet, i wouldnt recommend anyone to go here. theyll treat your mother like a dog with no remorse with their rudeness and attitude.",1
"service as usual but quick for a bite, sweet and sour chicken. ",5
"we love wong kei and frequent it often.  food is fast, fresh and cash only.  i havent had anything i don't like",4
"fantastic as always.... took my family there ... after 20 years of going here passed the baton over to my son's who also enjoyed it.amazing value, good chinese food.... enough said....if you go please try the grilled pork chops with chilli and salt...",5
"good food, fast service and reasonable price. the servers could come across as rude & bathrooms need work but the food is worth. beef brisket noodles with some chilli sauce is a must, heartwarming and soulful!",5
"nearly always have the bbq pork crispy pork rice, great as always",5
excellent cantonese style resturant. good for value.,5
great value with good portions.,5
"very tasty menu, great place.",5
nice food but they have the worst service. i am a frequent customer but im going just for the food,1
"cheap, filling food. shared tables. we were lucky to have our own table. fast service.",3
really nice cantonese food. beautiful dim sums.,5
really good food. not long waiting time.,5
"always great food and cheap, with quick service. as long as you don't expect service with a smile, this is a great place. its cash only, and you don't get a choice in where you sit or who you sit with as they always share tables, but for the price its great food",5
funny atmosphere ( service) but professional and very good food,4
"*cash only* ok chinese food for the budget conscious diner. be prepared for rude staff (one of the things the place is known for), and a scruffy interior.",3
crispy pork amazing. chilli sauce v hot. be at who careful.,5
"good food, lots of atmosphere, very quick service. we enjoyed ourselves. only takes cash which was a shock.",4
staff shout alot! food was ok i'm not sure if i would go back.,2
"food tasty, lots of seats. custinwr service not too civilised",3
"the staff have become too friendly, they used to throw people out 30 years ago. still good value cantonese food, best for groups and quick dining on ground floor for couples, students.",5
pls do not go! bad services! normal food! and they don't accept small changes! very bad experience ruined my day! i will not recommended anyone go to this restaurant because there are many other restaurants in the same street!,1
"this place is a experience i was missing out on. i wouldn't say much as i would spoil it for others. although i would add, the culture and  variety within the atmosphere had been lively upon my visit.",5
delicious food at low prices. really love the wonton noodle soup and beef brisket noodle soup. saw others with some very large rice meals too which i will try next time. great for solo travellers (although you may need to share a table)!,5
the quality and blandness of the food and cleanliness of the dining area is indicative of the price. on removing my jacketing and realising it would drag on the floor when hung on the back of my chair i opted to wear it and sweat it out. but if you need to fill your belly on a budget and you want your food pronto this place is ideal.,2
"do not go here for customer service. food excellent, service fast,  good value for the price. be prepared to share a table.",4
"cheap and good quality - if you know what to order. need to ignore some of the rude, rural chinese who work here though. some of them are genuinely unpleasant, although others are helpful.",4
"they were quite rude to me and my friends, and they even tried to charge us just for sitting down! absolutely ridiculous",1
this is my husbands favourite chinese. good food and price. not fancy dining but its always busy. service is quick and efficient. toilets aren't the cleanest but apart from that still the only place in china town that we eat,5
"this is a restaurant i have been to for many years.the prices are very reasonable, and the food id good.the seating arrangements may not suit all, but overall a very good restaurant at the price.",4
the place was fantastic food straight away on the go you don't have to wait long house white wine is excellent this is the second time i've been there and i thoroughly enjoyed the food worth going to this place right into chinatown in soho,5
"a multi-level chinese restaurant in london's chinatown. usually you share one of the numerous round tables with other diners. the food is tasty and the service is speedy, with efficiency taking priority over friendliness. hot and sour soup followed by chicken and black bean sauce is a favourite of ours",5
"very authentic chinese restaurant that made me feel like i was back in hong kong. comes complete with ok food, rude staff, cramped walkways and table sharing with dirty cutlery.would recommend for anyone who wants the full chinese food experience.",4
value for money. quick meal.,4
good and cheap food. terrible customer service.,3
the best duck noodle soup in town!,4
"bad service and attitude, food was average to low quality. we were not allow to order 3 plates of main course when we come in a group of 4, we were forced to order 4 or more main course. what a waste of money.",1
"famous for customers being told off by the restaurant waiters e.g. for sitting in the wrong place. fast and furious and recommended for quick, inexpensive hong kong food.",3
the food is always great. but the service is terrible! no chance of getting a tip.,4
"right, so i had very low expectations of this place based on the reviews here but have to say that i was pleasantly surprised. prices are very reasonable for the location, food is tasty and authentic, portions are fairly good and service nowhere near as bad as i anticipated. make sure to try their aubergine dishes!",4
"authentic and great taste even comparing to local asian standard! big portion and affordable, value for money serving. friendly staffs who speak various chinese languages. usually full but you can always get a seat soon as people dont stay long in the restaurant since it is crowded and packed.",5
"food is good and tend to be oily though. portion is big. service is questionable. worth visiting if you're in london. if you've been to hong kong, then expect them to be loud. nothing fancy. just eat and go.",3
relatively cheap and the authentic food is  however this place does not accept card- cash only!!!!,4
"this is no posh restaurant but it is one of the greatest i've been too. free tea served soon as you sit down. orders are taken, food arrived within 5 minutes. this place is huge so can imagine how big kitchen is. food taste delicious! soup is amazing. only place i eat when i go china town! go here you will not be disappointed.",5
"authentic chinese cuisine. the dish i had was scrambled egg, mushroom beef rice. it was very rich. decent flavor.",3
"i discovered this restaurant 35 years ago. terrible service at the time but so good and reasonable price. just came back, much better service, and still good. if you look for a good canteen, that's the  place !! simple, cheap and good . what else?",4
the food is tasteless and i wouldn't accept those surroundings if i hadn't been with friends,1
great cheap food. superfast service. i've been going for 30 years and it never disappoints.,5
"good food, rude staff with bad manners. i would still go back there to eat.",5
"the food isn't gonna win a michelin star, and while i find the service endearing others may find it too gruff. but as a solo eater there is nowhere better in the area for getting well priced, very satisfying cantonese food. the noodle soups in particular are an absolute steal",4
"love the food, nice and quick. still having a debate with the missus about whether the questionable service is actually an act",3
"used to be charming with the rude staff, i know this is their usp, but staff on phones and chewing gum, leaning over customers to get plates and clearly ignoring some customers trying to get their attention. cheap though...",1
very cheap. food is filling. i can't use chopsticks.,5
"we had to share a table. quirky... or just not enough space for everyone, it's that popular. food was ok.",3
great food but only food,5
"affordable food, you have to share a table with others which is interesting. the staff are really friendly",4
"cheap and cheerful stalwart chinese restaurant in china town. still here after many many years. i remember coming here around 35 years ago. seeing chinese people in the restaurant enjoying a meal is a good sign,  that's for sure...",5
"the prices have gone up but the service has gone down like, imagine low and then this is beneath it!the food is good though and that what brings me back to this place. the prices have gone up by 2 per dish recently. with this price range, i have more options around this restaurant now. conveniently located and lots of seating.",3
"busy restaurant, that only takes cash. the food is reasonably priced. i would recommend trying this place out.",3
"the food is good but the service is  well , one of the bazar experience the waiters are not appriciate that you come and eat. ",3
"cheap food, efficient service. staff weren't quite as famously rude as expected, which was a bit of a let-down.",4
"great food, shocking service. apparently thats 'how they do it', but it's not right",1
food is not bad but unkindly and unfriendly quite rude,2
cheap food that tastes great,5
"yun tuns skin is too thick. 4 stars for duck noodle, tasty and with amazing price only 5.9",4
"totally agree with other reviews, great food, professionally rude staff. cash only, are you looking at this hmrc?",3
good food great price,4
"i would say that the food is not good, even the service is not good, the staff is not smiling and polite at all. this is the most terrible meal i had in london, definitely not a good experience. would not recommend others to visit this restaurant.",1
"my go to place for chinese food in london. this is a place i can go to for every meal. conveniently located in chinatown next to leicester square underground. reasonably priced, extremely fast (though curt) service and food appear almost magically right after you order.",4
"if you like food and don't care about service this is the place for you. food is great, but to traditional westerners the service may seem lacking ",5
delicious hong kong style cuisine,5
"a good solid chinese restaurant, not amazing, mearly quite good ",4
"best roast duck and crispy pork noodle soup without exception, and at a reasonable price.",4
cheap no frills chinese food. love it,4
"average food, below average service but very reasonable prices.  good for a quick meal",3
"i m not a picky eater and usually eat everything but this was just awful. i ordered very basic wonton needle soup, very hard  to go wrong but it did. we were starving but left them untouched paid our bill and told the manager who didnt give it any thought. go else where.",1
i don't come here for fancy service. i come here for cheap canto food that does it's job of filling me up. the portions are a good size and the menu has a nice range. i've probably eaten at wong kei the most in chinatown as it's just so straight forward and quick to get a table. make sure you bring cash though!,5
"but just remember staff are a bit rude, but they make up for it with the food!",5
"great-tasting food at a reasonable price. this chinese restaurant offers an extensive menu and a quirky, no-frills, communal dining experience. located at the edge of london's chinatown and a few minutes from leicester square, this restaurant is a longtime favourite of londoners and regular visitors alike.",5
"12 noon on a sunday and not too busy. lunch for 2. delicious beef brisket on rice, aubergine in black bean sauce, extra rice, 1 fanta and chinese tea 25",5
"very good food, fast service, and reasonably priced. make sure that your expectations are set though, before going here. you come here for the food, and the bare minimal level of customer service. oh, and they only accept cash. highly recommended dish: braised beef brisket. absolutely superb.",4
great authentic chinese food.  communal dining at large circular tables.  excellent value for money,5
"favorite restaurant in china town. cheap, quick service, delicious food. been going here since ive been in the womb.",5
"if anything, the food here is great. it would be best to go for the food rather than a ""friendly"" conversation with one of the workers. let's say it won't go well if you chat with them...",3
"food good, staff not so much.",4
"classic chinese customer service, quick and good food, plenty of asian customer, which it's always a good sign.",4
"never changes, cash only, free green tea and refills, does seem more expensive these days though",4
"great food, unbeatable prices and no nonsense service. the best restaurant in china town",5
"average, in czech reublic we have better chinese meal... and we dont have china town",3
not nice staff to say the least.cheap but not good.my suggestion is choose any other or simply select dishes you really know or extremely simple to cook,1
now a china town classic. top tip..more free tea? take lid if the pot. remember cash only,4
the food was delicious. i would give 5 stars but the customer service was very bad.,4
"reliable, cheap fare. used to be incredibly rude - which was part of the deal - but for some reason have become strangely polite ",4
an institution in london.    been going for years.   food is the best chinese in london.   upstairs downstairs!   a really great experience with a group.    fast efficient and not expensive.,5
"cheapest food in chinatown, greasy not service and dirty. not recommend",1
"cheap and authentic, rough and ready eating house. staff not as rude as before, but that was part of the character! know what you're in for and this place his the spot.",4
food is very good but it's like a school canteen inside,4
"they seem to have been here for years. the seats downstairs and at ground level are very ""school like"". the first floor is a bit smarter. if you want straight forward chinese then this is a place to go. it's not fine dining though. they only take cash so be warned. a meal plus a bottle of wine came in at 90.",3
"cheap and cheerful , same for me since my first visit at christmas eve 1969! one star less for loss of entertainment value when you routinely got verbally abused... alas, those days are gone.",4
lovely fish ball noodle soup served within 5 minutes for 5.90 superb. poor decor.,4
the staff were very rude! and the food was terrible with a few hairs in it. i will never recomend to any one!!,1
"if you are from eastern, it is really tasty and good price. this is sweet and sour pork and yunnan stew noodle. both of them cost about 8.",4
"the food is very nice, but some of the staff are not very friendly",3
legendary for good value & bad service...,3
everything i've read about this place is true. they will put you on a sharing table. instant friends. they'll also change table covers while you're eating so be prepared as you may have to lift your bowl and plates as they do this.,5
very fast and food very good value,5
authentic and fast!!! it was worth a visit!,4
absolute hidden gem in chinatown. in a area not short of choice but this is one of the best spots to eat. won ton soup is my favourite and the duck pancakes. dont expect fine dining service but expect delicious food and an efficient service.,5
"certain dish taste good like the roast duck with pancake, certain not...massive price hike trough the years, some ingredients has been westernized after the mighty old manager left...",2
the food and great and tasty and the tables and plates+utensils are also clean however the service is hilariously funny the waiters dont smile and they look like theyre dead inside . also you cant pay by card either of they would allow that they would definitely get more customers. would still suggest going for a good meal.,3
excellent. full of character and characters. i have been coming here for nearly 25 years. here's to 25 more.,5
"absolutely awful.  the place is renowned for being rude to customers, but tonights experience was worse than awful.  the useless waitress didnt even know whether their food had sugar in it. so they kicked us out!  avoid!",1
cheap and cheerful. good food and excellent service.,5
we loved our food here! so yummy! we had two children with us. the only thing i'd say is that the don't have highchairs.... but we managed! fast service and helpful staff! would go back.,4
"some dishes are ok, some are terrible.it's very cheap indeed",3
great food- not as rude as they were 35 years ago  but still fun - try asking for a quiet table for 2!!!,5
absolutely appreciate this restaurant. value second to none.,5
a really nice environment with delicious food. the chicken and pork were particularly special!,5
"great food, cocktails and decor. pleasingly small.",5
"very good food, nice tea,  and great service.",5
"has great sentimental value, would gladly go here again. staff were lovely and food was stellar. will become one of my restaurant staples. the decor was spot on for 1930s taipei.",5
"i wanted to like this place but the food was appallingly salty - as if the chef added salt thrice. the food was otherwise quite flavourful, albeit small. like what others have said here, the service wasnt great but i dont really mind because i was there for the food, but it was kind of a let down. :(( i wont rush to go back.",2
what an extraordinary restaurant. every dish is amazing. seating can be a bit cramped but i am more than happy to put up with that for this food. ,5
"i like the interior, the presentation, the service. but the food is hard to say: there is very little that is taiwanese or even chinese about the food. unless you look at the chopsticks and some of the plates. for experimental cuisine, i'd rate it very good but not quite excellent.",4
great food well presented,5
food is intolerable. would never go again.,1
delicious and creative with a nostalgic ambiance and '20s music,5
"great food, service, ambience, decor. just a cut above any other asian ive been to in london. feels a bit like a taiwanese gymkhana.",5
good food but the quality of service is not good.,4
"started by people behind bao. i was here on the first day they opened. i was here again the first day they started their tea ceremony. i've had many taiwanese meal, nothing came close to xu when it comes to the quality and inventiveness. highly highly recommended!",5
"seriously good food, everything is good but l would definitely recommend the eel!",5
great food and a great atmosphere. i'd highly recommend they're specialities very tasty and just the right amount so you don't overheat.,5
"not authentic, very small portion sizes, overpriced :(",2
"great food, stylish decor 5 star service at a very good price. best value for money in a long time.",5
"atmosphere, service and food just great! a bit pricy, but worth it",5
"outstanding restaurant specialising in taiwanese food. the food is outstanding, service great and the interior very stylish. booking is essential!",5
my new favourite in london. excellent starters. love the ambiance. service 6/10,5
silly place. cool decor but the food is so expensive for what it is and is 98% salt. save some money and just pop next to door to chinatown and get better food for a lot less. this place is stuck between hipster-over indulgence and authentic asia. does both pretty poorly.,1
art deco interiors and interestingly good food. service should have been much better.,4
"stylish, mannered and welcoming",4
expensive and boring,3
delicious. really tasty and innovative taiwanese food.,5
super disappointed. had been wanting to try this for ages. everything was far too salty. only thing i liked were the cocktails. but they were tiny. far too expensive for what was served. i would recommend bao. not xu. parents ended up refusing to eat the food so we went to chinatown afterwards,1
"fantastic food and venue, only slightly let down by the abrupt and some what unwelcoming service. would have been a 5.",4
very good... definitely coming back.,5
"amazing food, friendly staffs, also really lovely decoration that goes really well with the atmosphere of the restaurant aim to bring out.",5
"nice ambiance, quality interior decor. however, the food is overrated.",2
"nice restaurant, good service, ok food but quite overpriced",3
"original in many ways, interesting and sufficiently diverse menu, excellent knowledgeable and attentive staff although it takes a long time until food gets served. cocktails and drinks selection ok but not great value for money or otherwise exceptional.",4
"lovely ambience, excellent service. we ordered a variety of dishes but the highlights were the chicken main dish, vermicelli side dish, and the cold brew house tea which was exquisite!!",5
cozy space and everything we ordered was delicious!,5
"good food, great interior. i love most of the starters and the mapo tofu was simply amazing..",4
"taiwanese fusion, but tasted more like chinese fusion. i'd suggest adding more chinese waiters to add to the atmosphere. does seem a bit whitewashed for a taiwanese place. the tomato eel was small in portion with lots of vinegar, and chilli oil. the signature pork is pretty good, as well as the onion rice.",4
"really happy with the food here, the ambience is lovely, with a 30s oriental vibe. the lardo lard rice is amazing and a must try, so is the egg drop crab.",5
"wow!  this place is to die for!  the tea selection, all the dishes and a cool atmosphere",5
very tasteful taiwanese food and friendly staff. cozy atmosphere.,5
"absolutely delicious food, different from the fare on offer in other restaurants in the area and each dish perfectly balanced and presented. add to this the beautiful interiors...a new london favourite!",5
three stars for the food and four stars for the venue and presentation. the cheese and leek pancake was good.,3
"simply superb high end chinese / taiwanese... adored it, not cheap though...",4
amazing food and great service.,5
"really beautiful interior, friendly staff and good food and drink.my only problem was, as another reviewer noted, the vegetarian/vegan options were limited and didnt add up to a feeling of having had a whole meal.",4
fancy taiwanese food i'm not sure if they are original since i never been to taiwan province but the environment was pleasent. and food are ok.,4
"the best chinese restaurant i've ever been to. a little expebssive, but the experience is worth evey penny.",5
"stunningly good tea, friendly staff, great atmosphere ",5
surprisingly average. lovely surroundings but have had better for less.,3
such a great place. food was amazing - from starters (prawn) to desserts (sponge). definite recommendation.,5
one of the most interesting restaurants i have been to. unique food in a unique environment which you don't often find in london any more,5
nice food but disappointing.,3
"this is a really original venue and certainly feels unique. a gentle ambiance makes one feels we had stepped into a 1920s chinese tea house. the staff were good at guiding us through the menu. the food was delicate, delicious and well presented. definitely worth it for understated style and food.",5
"tasty food, nice decor - went twice and there were both super positive experiences.",5
"popped in for some drinks and dumplings. their taro dumplings (particularly the taiwanese sausage one) are out of this world. the bone marrow pancakes were also great, and the cocktails surprisingly tasty.",5
"unimpressive, overrated, forgettable and wildly overpriced.",2
"food was great but the potion was small. a nice interior and the food was presented nicely. the service can be improved : it took about 10-15mins to serve a cocktail (each time, we had to remind the waiter) and one of the waiters was not friendly. i wouldn't rush to go back,..",3
"one of my favourite places in london right now. great value,  great service. the ma po tofu is a game changer.  also the xu reisling is an excellent wine. the staff are super knowledgeable and will help you through the menu easily. the lunch rice bowls are especially good value and the 39 set menu will leave you stuffed.",5
one of the best meals we've had in a long time. the set menu is fantastic value at 40 and offers you a generous selection of food. highly recommended.,5
reserve in advance or try a walk-in. the restaurant is beautiful inside with a luxurious feel. food can be a little spicy so be sure to put forth any concerns to your waiter. lastly dont start your meal without trying the cocktails.,5
"foood was great, service was terrible.",2
delicious food and lovely service. not the cheapest but not expensive enough to ruin the meal. their recommendations were spot on too. the wine was really good but about 10 pounds too much. that's why i'm not giving it 5 stars.,4
lovely tea based cocktails! there's nowherr else liks this in london,5
a second visit proved to be just as wonderful as the first. ingenious food and cocktails leave you more than satisfied in wonderful mid-century surroundings.,5
"what a wonderful place. the food, the ambience and the staff, even the drinks. highly recommended.",5
"really very good. had the dumpling tasting menu and some red date tea. what i had was very tasty. only thing left me thinking was for what they charge, i hope they get a star soon.",4
nice vibe .great service .good food,5
"lovely decor - creates the classic taiwanese teahouse. had the suckling pig for two, the quail, the sweet potato dumplings - all delicious. lovely tea as well.",5
"absolutely loved everything we ate here. the lunch menu is extremely well priced and very generous with what you get. just thinking of this meal, makes me salivate.",5
"food was incredible, service was exceptional and the small cosy restaurant was the perfect setting for saturday evening out with friends. i would recommend the restaurant to anyone! we will visit again soon",5
"would recommend this place to anyone. stunningly good food served in a luxurious restaurant. left feeling full, having tried new flavours and with a commitment to return. i quite liked it, can you tell?",5
"great decor, the food was good although i felt the sea bass was a little bland. on the whole we felt that the dishes were too small for the price they were. favourite dishes were the crab with deep fried bao, tofu and mushroom rice. for starters i loved the cuttlefish toast.",4
"we opted for the pre-theatre menu and were very disappointed in the tiny portions, oily food, and generally obnoxious service...avoid!",1
fantastic. delicious. great tea. expensive but worth it. upstairs is more beautiful. service great!,5
"a really great experience, the first time i had ever had taiwanese food, and it was worth it for the price!",5
"excellent food, drinks and service. we will definitely be going back",5
good food but overpriced,4
"incredible food, cocktails and teas.",5
"ma lai cake is quiet good. the rests, like char siu and mapo tofu,are not rly yummy even it is not called taiwanese flavorplease come visit asia for chef tour/training trip .",2
"yummy, original taiwanese food in a lovely setting. i've been here twice and have enjoyed it both times. serving sizes are on the smaller side, but everything is really tasty. decor has a cool 1920s vibe to it, as do the sever uniforms. i'm sure i'll be back again.",4
lovely looking amd nice staff but pricey and the set meal high tea has too little savoury food and too much desert to be a suitable lunch,4
"wonderful tea room, lovely teas, good for a quiet drink while out in central london",5
i decided to try this place due to really good reviews. the decor was lovely and i really liked the theme of the restaurant. the food was a complete let down. was extremely salty and the portions were tiny. not worth the amount they are charging. i won't be coming back here.,2
"amazing service, food and drinks! can't recommend enough.",5
"a very fine dining experience. beautiful decor upstairs; art deco stream train themed. the cocktails were exquisite and the food immense! highly recommend the shou pa chicken, beef shortrib pancakes and the cuttlefish toast, though can imagine everything on the menu is divine.",5
timeless atmosphere. it feels like you are in a 1920's train crossing china. staff was very attentive and respectful. the food felt both authentic and high standard and everything was delicious. there are also single tables for solo diners which are very cute.,5
"had the traditional tea ceremony. they do it for you the first round of tea and then you get to have a go which is fun. lovely selection of savoury and sweet, which wasnt too sweet. would definitely recommend if you find traditional afternoon tea too much",4
only reason for three stars ... lengthy.. felt like an hour between each course. food was nice.,3
delicious. really recommend this place original combinations.,5
amazing food. some flavours i've never had before. i  can recommend the chicken and crab mains - both delicious. more fine dining than traditional taiwanese. only minor issue was the waiting for a table even though we had booked.,5
brilliant tasting menu,5
"good food, service only ok, very tasty but pretty overpriced. good.",4
"really weirdly intensely flavoured, tiny baby portion sized versions of chinese classics. defo go if someone else is paying",5
"we werent that impressed with the food. our table was hidden away in the mahjong room which we werent too pleased with. very expensive for what it is, and we were definitely expecting more from this place.",3
"we enjoyed every plate we tasted and there are not many places you can say that about. impeccable service, great interiors, delicious food and superb cocktails. perfect for a treat dinner as it's quite pricey! ",5
"great food, fantastic interior and the staff are amazing.  i'm always happy to spend an evening feasting here",5
"absolutely delicious. the food was wonderful, the cocktails spot on, and the atmosphere is great - buzzy but not too loud and beautifully designed. somewhat pricey but not unusually so given the quality of everything.",5
"i have mixed feelings about xu. love the interior design. excellent service. good cocktails. the food was elegant and refined, but it wasn't really taiwanese. maybe ""inspired by taiwanese"" would be more appropriate...",4
hard to believe that kale and tofu can taste so good. the steamed egg with truffle is also sublime. delightful ambience too.,5
"visited xu in the afternoon and tried the afternoon menu. very impressed beautiful restaurant, friendly staff and great food especially the suckling pig. the tea was also very special and worth trying. overall i would recommend xu, it is on the more expensive side bet well worth it.",4
"good food if a little expensive, but great service and lovely ambiance in the top floor room. we weren't convinced by the glazed sweet and sour aubergine, but all other dishes (the various types of small wraps/dumplings and particularly the pork) were great.",4
"- good environment, really nice food!- ideally book online before going",4
london's take on taiwanese food. all the dishes we've tried are rich and flavoursome. they have their tea bar headed by their inhouse expert! the cold brewed tea is really fantastic and a must try.,4
"complete let down, the pork was fatty and extremely salty, the portions tiny and the service slow. the location and interior was great but that is about it.",1
i had hopes this restaurant would impress. i gave it a second chance but unfortunately the food was the same as the first visit - bland. service was neither warm nor unpleasant. was quite disappointed walking out of there on both occasions.,2
very good authentic cuisine,5
brings me back to the memory lane of childhood street food. yum,5
classy and tasty but a little overpriced,3
amazing char siu pork and decadent interior reminiscent of colonial era taipei. interesting tea selection coming from medicine drawer counters,5
the decor is breathtaking and the food is some really interesting adaptions on some classic chinese dishes. they are delicious,5
food was very good but the portions were tiny and the service needs some improvement. also we were overcharged on the bill for an item we didnt order.,3
good food. different dishes and tastes.. but felt a little too pricey,4
we had an excellent dinner at xu. every plate was beautifully presented and came with an explosion of well balanced flavours. friendly but especially genuine service.we will definitely be back!,5
"delicious taiwanese food. interesting cocktail list as well, abs a nice atmosphere. the tables upstairs next to the window are lovely.",5
fantastic food and service couldn't fault it at all,5
excellent service. our  server was very kind and was happy to recommend and help us with our queries food was lovely. loved the gyoza. highly recommend.,5
literally amazing!! the bao team have outdone themselves! the decor is luxurious. the menu options are unique and delicious! the beef dish is heavenly. and ... its all reasonably priced for the quality! get a booking here immediately!!,5
great place. felt very cool and classy.,5
nice taiwanese fusion restaurant with a good decor. entree and small dishes are good but very small for the value. the main dishes are good in flavour and presentation but also probably not good food for value. however would be a good place to try.,3
"great food, - garlic steamed cockles to die for!!! very good service (with the exception of the main host) but very small tables and uncomfortable seating.",4
i literally had to puke after having dinner. me and my wife went there and ordered the fixed menu. everything was fried and truly disgusting,1
delicious and inventive taiwanese cuisine. yummy small plates and great cocktails. love the idea of whiskey and tea pairings! they recently started serving the tea time menu and it's absolutely superb - lots of small plates/dishes to try. the mini tea ceremony is also really fun. highly recommend the tea!,5
"service was good, could be improved, however food was on point! my favourite is the chilli egg drop crab!",4
"amazing food and excellent, cozy environment!",5
"delicious food in a very nice setting. the restaurant has good service and has comfy booth seats. upstairs has a nicer ambience, so ask for a table upstairs. the starters were very tasty and the main just the right size. overall great food that is different from the usual, and every dish has it's own distinct flavour.",5
this is so good. i recommend the chicken house special and the taro dim sum. also the tea tasing menu was lovely,5
"fantastic restaurant, small tapas-like dishes with new and exciting flavours, good selection of drinks and wines. helpful and friendly staff. this is certainly a must-visit if you find yourself in the area.",5
"it's a good place for people who prefer flavour over taste of ingredient. they cook meat in a distinctive way, juicy and tender. overall think it's overpriced for the portion of food.",3
some of the dishes contains flavours that are surprisingly true to taiwanese flavour. but some of the fusion dishes can taste weird.,4
amazing experience. great pre theater menu with a twist.,5
"great decour, innovative and interesting food.",4
"food is excellent - dishes prepared with great care, are unique and delicious. interior is very well done - like stepping into a taiwanese tea house. service although friendly was disorganised and slow. if they can sort this out i would love to go back.",4
this place is absolutely beautiful. tea and food delicious. well worth the visit.,5
"great place, very professional and friendly staff who made our experience feel extra special. food was so tasty and interesting. thanks again.",5
"fantastic, authentic taiwanese food. the set menu is a good offer, highly recommend the chickens and crab mains.",5
it's all about the ambiance i am afraid. the restaurant space is pretty small. the food is way too greasy than it should be and i dont quite agree that these are typical taiwanese food. most of the dishes have confusing names and are not taiwanese recopies.,2
great interior design. excellent food. you feel as if youve time travelled to taiwan in 30s.,5
"good place, nice modern take on taiwanese food but found everything a bit salty. authentic flavours and good service",4
highly recommend the shoupa chicken and the caviar toast. the  lord rice was so authentic that take me back home from the first taste. didnt find the dumpling or xianbing too attractive though.,5
the dumplings were fantastic - great variety of choice and the teas were very good. love the atmosphere - reminds me of old hong kong style,5
went there a while ago but loved everything!!! really nice take on taiwanese cuisine and super happy to have a nice taiwanese restaurant in london. will definitely return whenever i miss home. booking highly recommend.,5
"very very tasty and special chinese dishes. only downside was that after being at the gym before coming, i left a bit hungry... we had the tasting menu which was excellent.",4
"had a really nice afternoon tea here! love the tea and the sweets, especially the pineapple cakes, but the savouries can be improved (lack a little in its flavour). overall a very unique experience, with great service and not too pricey.",4
good food and nice atmosphere,5
consistently amazing food and service!,5
so crowded. the restaurant crammed way too many people into such a small place. the food is okay but does not justify the high price.,3
"fantastic place with great flavours and gentle ambience. ordered the crab (singapore style), cuttle fish toast, chicken char sui and pork puffs. everything was amazing with each dish better than the last.",5
"the flavours of taiwan, from teas to full meals, served in a wood panelled take on 1930s taipei.",5
"had never tried taiwanese food before coming here, i'm very glad i came, you're doing your culture proud by serving food that good. very impressed overall. good service, friendly staff and a warm and welcoming atmosphere.",4
the chat sui is a must try!,4
"great decor, amazing taiwanese food, and tea.on a pricey side. an evening for two with no alcohol for almost 100. you can get a 3-course menu in a michelin star place for that. i'd recommend revising the prices.",5
"very innovative and tasty food and good service. set lunch is very good value. the restaurant is small so i would advise to book. we did not and ended up at a table by the door, which is somewhat exposed to the elements every time the door opens.",4
"very nice place, good service and great food. try the smoked tea duck, best thing ever!",5
"excellent service, a staff very friendly, the food was really good!",5
very bad food and service. i had a stomach ache after i ate there.,1
really nice looking place and good service but hugely overpriced. tiny portions that did not taste great.,2
"the service in this place is incredible. super friendly staff, very attentive, and very helpful when describing the menu. if you go here, get the iberico pork for main course! it is incredible!",5
amazing food great atmosphere,5
"while rather pricey, this traditional tea house offers a unique experience. the food is delicious, skillfully prepared, and well presented. the service is also excellent. overall very satisfied with the experience. would definitely meet here with friends from london or visiting next time i get a chance.",5
fabulous place with great food! the waiter was extremely good and took his time to explain the food and wine. top notch!,5
"wonderful experience! delicious food, great recommendations from the stuff, amazing decoration and atmosphere. we had a lovely evening here! try their cocktails, unusual and full of flavour.",5
"a very pretentious restaurant one should avoid unless you want to feel unsatisfied and unhappy at the end of the meal. yep, this place do that to you. neither chinese nor taiwanese, not for people who have real class tastebuds. their xian bing is so awful, and wasn't cooked through properly...",1
great food. pricey with small portions though.,4
"attentive service. delectable cocktails. engaging atmosphere. sumptuous presentation. but most importantly... top class taiwanese food, vivid flavours that are beautifully presentedl, perfectly timed, and gleefully unafraid to serve signature dishes laced liberally with chicken and pork fat.",5
"a fascinating place to eat! with it's old colonial style decor and brilliant service xu offers great food which will keep you coming back for more. we had the pre-theatre veggie set menu and it was morish, speedy and very tasty. their tea and drink selection was great and i would recommend to anyone in the area.",5
wow. what a pleasure. definitely the place to go for a nice lunch or dinner. makes you feel like you in a french little city restaurant with authentic well delivered taiwanese cuisine. definitely on my list of favorite restaurants.,5
the food is ok. but very very slow. also very expensive compare to the quality and quantity.,1
every single dish we tried was very good and special. the cocktails were also divine. i also loved the classy decor reminiscent of the 1920s. the staff was polite and attentive. i would highly recommend!,5
"probably one of the best taiwanese in london, gin made drinks are very good too",5
steamed egg was not hot enough but tasted good. lard rice is good but too much juice to make it too greasy. others are not bad! the environment is great and comfortable. im  a taiwanese. the char siu pork is a little bit salty and fatty!,3
"good atmosphere. good sound insulation good toilet good service. but the food was not good. especially at the price point with small portions, not at all recommendable. with all the nearby options, not a place to go to enjoy food.",2
"vegetarian options are quite average to be honest. a forgettable meal. they also forgot that it was my partners birthday. service could be improved in terms of attentiveness. the decor, branding and overall vibe is very cool.",3
"the atmosphere is 5 star. however as taiwanese food, its toooooo modern and loses the original flavor. not a good choice if you really want to try taiwanese style:/",2
"great food. there were three of us and we ate the try menu. the food exquisite and the red wine was especially good from the drink menu. we will come back. nice atmosphere, cozy and good customer services",5
"best food, super nice staff, constantly fantastic atmosphere. they charge reasonable pricing and the food quality is awesome. keep up the good work.",5
very nice food and great staff. our server simona was amazing!! we had a great start of the new year!!,5
the atmosphere in this place is unique! the furniture and the ilumination it makes you feel like you're in asia. i went for a ceremony tea ( pictures below) and i could taste two different top quality teas combined with two rounds of excellence delicatessens ( savoury and sweet). i totally recommend the whole experience!,4
very special i think. the decor is very romantic and the food amazing. lovely place.,5
"if two people order two set menus, it would be better if the food comes in separate plates, not in one plate. the servers touched the bowl when serving, and it was not hygiene. pricey.   mapo tofu was not original at all.",3
"great selection of interesting dishes, modern take on classical taiwanese. the interior is also very enjoyable.",5
excellent food and the tea is amazing. would definitely go again.,4
possibly my favourite chinese restaurant in london at the moment  the sweet potato dumplings are ,5
"i would say its not authentic taiwanese cuisine, more like fusion chinese food. for my experience, compare to the taste of food, its a bit pricey, you pay for the interior decoration and the atmosphere. and for most dishes we ordered, its either too dry (eg. the duck) or too creamy/ greasy (eg. the crab).",3
"very neat little place,quirky design.worth a visit.",4
"excellent restaurant with a unique twist on taiwanese food. there is a welcome focus on ceremony without seeming overly demanding to visitors. the food is wonderful, the cod roe sandwiches, chili crab in egg drop and fried pigs tails were memorable.",5
"nice atmosphere. creative, contemporary and not didascalic interpretation of taiwanese cuisine. very good dumplings, tea and cocktails.",4
lovely interior. staff were amazing. food delicious however would not recommend set menus. portions are incredibly small.,5
tapas style asian food v tasty tasting menu is a bit pricy but with it,4
we had the a la carte menu with the wine pairing and it was good. i wouldn't say it was exceptional but the staff kind and attentive.,3
"food look good but way too pricey for what you get. being born and bred in taiwan, these are not authentic taiwanese food. the service was awful, we waited for 15 mins to get our food menu and waited for more than 40 mins between our starters and main dishes. overall too overpriced.",1
no bad comment on the taste of food. the two stars is all because the service and partially the price. servers are not welcoming and no patient for any question. we got steam rice served at the very end of the meal when theres only 1 dish left to eat with white rice.,2
"love the ambiance here. portions are on the smaller side but the food is always great and delicately made, one of my favourite places in london",5
good restaurant. the pork is amazing. very nice interior and good drinks,4
"had a really good time here - lovely food (especially the dumplings) and a chilled out and relaxed atmosphere. nicely decorated, and a great place to come for a celebration or romantic meal. good service",5
"an excellent representation of a taiwanese tea house. the interior is mahogany dark. you are transposed to 50s taiwan a remarkable transformation and the food is exquisite. perfectly balanced. we experienced the hospitality of a tattooed german gent. and the food well, check the pictures.",5
"decor to die for and the friendliest service youll ever experience. the food is authentic, tasty and (for the location) reasonably priced. can recommend the tasting menu, especially if youre unfamiliar with taiwanese cuisine (and lets be honest, apart from the taiwanese, who is?)",5
"xu is genuinely a different experience from the usual chinese restaurant experience and the place really does feel like you are in 1930s taiwan. the egg drop crab is amazing and the shou pa chicken too. i will definitely be going back ....not the cheapest, but excellence is not cheap.",5
"best bubble tea of all time! i always queue for the mudflip special, but defoo worth it guys!!!",5
"serves its purpose.very, very ascetic.fresh taste.",5
a little surprise on the bottom,5
love the mudflip (aka brown sugar pearl milk tea) but the wait can be long and they only have it at two time slots during the day until sold out. their fruit tea is refreshing,5
delicious tea - best bubble tea ive had. i would recommend milk tea with slight sugar and bubbles!,5
"delicious milk tea and pearls. quick service, yet to try their famous mudflip milktea which is sold in limited in quantity.",5
refreshing fruit tea. cant believe i try this in london instead of hong kong!,5
the mudslide ,5
drinks here are good but really annoyed with the one drink per person policy for the brown sugar pearl milk tea. so if i'm buying more than one of these drinks for my family/friends i need to keep coming back in a disguise... why the 'exclusivity'??? it's unnecessary.,1
"excellent tea shop in london, be fond of their fruit tea. all natural taste can be rich in the mouth",5
they produce a cone with lots of bubbles (should have taken a photo of it).,4
terrible brand....never buy it again,1
excelllent ambience and great food,5
"love how there is fresh fruit in my pineapple green tea! ive been waiting to try yi fang but wanted to avoid the long queues. the tapioca pearls are on the smaller side and arent very chewy (just soft) but apart from that, the drink was refreshing. i can imagine itd be even better on a hot day. adjustable sugar/ice levels available.",4
this small outfit was at a recent food festival in london they have a great team and serve proper thirst quenching teas,5
always park on the yellow line and block traffic,1
best bubble tea around!,5
we had to wait 25 min after ordering and paying for the drinks. then we were told the pearls were told out but they would be happy to refund us. a waste of time. you couldve mentioned that when we were ordering.,1
best ever !!! loved it,5
"i highly enjoy the tea here only issue is that teas do sell out quickly, its not worth going in the evening as none of my favourite flavours will be available",5
"bought bubble tea once. from the liquid it seems they put less milk than other bubble tea sellers. it tastes not rich, more like a mixture of sugar and water. overrated.",3
have applied many times but they never respond after viewing my cv. guess prejudiced in appointing staff only from china,2
basic,3
such great drinks - amazing.,5
super delicious milk teas ;),5
the best tea i've ever had! also great customer service.,5
too watery the bubble tea not worth the hype. there are better bubbles tea places in london.,2
just as good as the original. their mudflip is awesome.,5
i love this so much ,5
delicious fruit tea cold drink. would recommend. service is quick.,4
nice but still prefer the original stores in taiwan though:),4
"went on 27/08, the cashier was without any smile and didnt give me the points card.",4
"great fruit and milk tea! the long queues are for the mudflip tea, which they only serve twice a day. i tried it in hk and its really good, but ive yet to try it here. the fruit teas are really nice though with a generous serving of fresh fruit! ",5
"the taste is just normal, the staff is not friendly. and milk tea is quite no taste even i ordered normal sugar",3
good fruit tea.,4
"very nice place, i ordered fresh milk tea and yi fang fruit tea and both of them were amazing!!!",5
"pineapple green tea way too sweet even with only 30% sugar... tastes like sugar water, not worth the queue.",2
pretty cool...although not sure we actually went there. google told us we did...,3
bad service,1
poor service,1
delightful tea shop.,4
good tea,4
good.,5
tasty but expensive,4
not authentic. they put too many artificial and unhealthy stuffs in the drink.,1
"limited menu available however, they offer unique flavours. the yakult milk iced tea is strange as it has a slight sour taste. but overall it is quite pleasant. the store usually has very very long queues so beware. furthermore, my server lacked good english proficiency so it was slightly difficult to communicate.",3
hyped but the hype was worth it,5
super authentic,5
expensive,2
104 shaftesbury ave,5
amazing taste! but quite pricy for bubble tea i would say. the price has gone up quite a bit since they first opened.,5
"i like the fact that they have more of the authentic flavours. wait times can be long though, as they're always busy",3
"this yifang doesnt have the hot option unlike their spitalfields one, here they only have warm which cooled down much too quickly.also the pearls were clumped together into a  mass.",3
"absolutely love their milk teas. also, very convenient to have them at bond street station. staff is very friendly! :) highly recommend!",5
a no bs hole in the wall store - which is great. ordered very quickly and the milk tea was delicious.,4
"this location  makes better drinks than the other one which is like 5 mins walk away, the other shop constantly gets the sugar level wrong...",4
let's try 50% yi fang fruit tea in this summer!,5
best authentic taiwanese bubble tea. recommend fruit tea!,5
"amazing!!! love the brown sugar pearls with milk, will defo come back for it worth the wait. highly recommend it!",5
tea was ok. their signature drink was sold out.,3
authentic taiwanese bubble tea!!  highly recommended,5
"milk tea was ok, very limited choice of flavours",2
it's like normal bubble tea. how bad can it be?,5
great taiwanese bubble tea,5
one of the best london bubbles tea,5
incredible experience the food was very very good,5
i love fruit tea very much! fresh and delicious,5
"its too slow, it takes 30 mins to get your drink when there are about 15 ppl in the queue only.",4
the most delicious pearls ever had at europe!,5
nice,5
good,4
hands down the best bubble tea in london!,5
best bubble tea in london! had to wait in the queue  for almost one hour but is always worth it.,5
best bubble tea & fruit tea ive tried in london,5
japanese food hmmm,5
"pandan ice cream, need i say more ",5
"delicious, rich beautiful ice cream. friendly staff, with reasonable prices.",5
the rose and lychee macaron ice cream is the best dessert ive ever had but be sure to check they have it as the menu options vary each day based on season.,5
horlicks & pandan coconut flavor ,5
amazing selection of home made 'south east asian' flavoured ice creams. corn / durian / pandan / milo / vietnamese coffee / etc. highly recommended ! let me know when you are able to deliver nationwide,5
"omggggg can't say any better words about this place!! amazing, that's it. you must come here! icecream are the best flavours you will ever try and the soft serve boba ice cream too !",5
"love, wish more vegan flavours though!",5
nice flavours! tasty ice cream! matcha cookie worth a try!,5
great ice cream. lots of accurate asian flavours.,5
the best & most delicious lychee ice cream ive ever tried!!!,5
fantastic ice cream - milk tea flavour is excellent! can diy ice cream sandwich from macaron or cookie. is quite warm in there though,5
yummy ice cream with macaroons. the matcha oreo flavor is quite good.,5
"i had a hard time choosing which flavour to try, i went for the hong kong tea with condensed milk.woah! it was incredible!the flavour variety here is original and i recommend visiting. my partner is coeliac, so gluten free is essential. they were cool about that and had some great choices.enjoy!",5
love this place and have revisited. delicious ice cream macaroons that are not overly sweet. however they no longer have the pre-made ones so you just build your own. tastes just as good!,5
best ice cream in london. possibly the world! such cool flavours. i'm a big fan of durian,5
such a colourful place! its not all about instaworthy looks they have very unique flavors too,5
delicious ice cream. try with macarons.,5
"place is a bit rundown and there's no loo, but the service and food are nice",3
amazing! great and very tasty ice cream and ice cream sandwiches- you can creat your own. good location and friendly staff.,5
fun concept and good ice cream. however the opening times seem to differ from those mentioned online.,4
the pretty pictures do not reflect the end result. the macarons are not well baked and the ice cream itself is not the best.... not worth the 5,1
delicious ice cream in a calm and welcoming surrounding,5
"seriously good! ice cream is more milky than creamy, but beautifully & freshly flavoured. lovely staff, pretty place. ammmmmazing macaroons. perfect.",5
i was so excited to try their macaroons and it was super yummy! im actually heading there now and cant wait to have more ,5
"really cute little ice cream place with loads of asian inspired flavours to choose from including milo, pandan, pocky etc. nice atmosphere with a few tables to sit at too.",5
my favourite macaroon sandwiches! the best x,5
very underwhelming especially for the price. i saw the raves online so hurried here to have ice cream with chunks of actual ice in it. the ice cream wasn't creamy either. i wish i ate at some of the other shops in the area truthfully.,2
"great service,  friendly staff and nice atmosphere. had their vegan sorbet and that was delicious ",5
incredible pandan icecream and macaron. highly recommend going here!awesome staff too,5
lovely wild variety of ice cream that doesn't disappoint,5
"lovely little ice cream shop with asian-inspired flavours. the ice cream sandwiches were delicious, the brownies were especially scrumptious. maybe could use a little more variety of ice cream flavours, but its asian inspired and theyre not huge on sugary things, awesome nonetheless.",4
very cool flavors like pandan coconut and vietnamese ice coffee!,5
"wonderful ice cream store. it's in a great location, where it is close enough to the action, but not so close that it's swarming with tourists. the desserts are out of this world, and are well worth the money you pay for them.",5
nice little treat...nice ice cream idea but is expensive and ice cream wasn't as smooth as i was expecting for the price.  tried the lemon meringue which wasn't too sweet.,4
"i was visiting from the us and had seen this place on a list of insta-worthy stops. definitely a gorgeous photo, but the ice cream sandwich with macarons and lucky charms ""milk"" was maybe even more delicious than it looks! it's huge, so i'd recommend sharing with a friend. sad i don't have something like this more local to me!",5
"really good ice cream enjoyed the novelty of it as well as the high class finish. however, you do have to pay a pretty penny for the experience and so next time i will be having a 99 flake!",3
would recommend the brownie and raspberry macaron sandwiches.,4
absolutely love this cute little store! i have been countless times as they change the flavours regularly. love the ice cream macarons and the unique flavours.,5
the flavour variety here is original and i recommend visiting.,4
"very cute atmosphere with amazing food and service, rated the bts songs!",5
from the days that yolkin would just have pop up shops to now. it has always been good. love the variety and create your own from the macaron ice cream sandwiches. the brownie was a perfect combination with the viet coffee ice cream,5
yummy treat! i tried the smores ice cream sandwich and my partner had the coconut (thai style i think it was) they were both delicious and not overly sweet so i could actually enjoy it fully. the macroon is is a great substitute for cookies for an ice-cream sandwich! and great for anyone who is gluten free ,4
best place to go for ice cream on a sunny day with flavors you won't see anywhere else.,4
"first time visitor, was recommended this place by my girlfriend. wow the ice-cream filled macarons are incredible. next time i'm in london i'll make a detour and go back ",5
"absolutely amazing macaroon ice cream sandwiches! me and my sister were visiting london from canada and were blown away by these ice cream sandwiches. they are so unique and so delicious, the macaroons are delightful and the ice cream is also delicious. these are a must try if you are in london!",5
special ice cream flavour,5
such a colourful place! its not all about instaworthy looks they have very unique flavors too.,4
i don't know of any other places like it. it's a good place to go for a treat. i would go for the flavours you wouldn't typically find elsewhere,4
interesting and tasty ice cream flavors. staff is adorable and the shop is lovely!,5
"cute little ice cream store, big portions. nice quiet store, can be annoying when you're trying to get past several instagram photos being taken. staff are lovely.",5
i think id definitely go back to try the ice cream on its own. this rose water flavoured macaroon sandwich was good but not a favourite. very friendly staff and pretty cosy. very pretty designs and selection of flavours. reasonably priced compared to other deserts places. will visit again soon.,4
ice cream tasted great,4
highly recommend the boba soft serve!,5
heavy hong kong flavour influenced homemade ice creams well worth trying. my favourite was the hk tea flavoured ice cream but the egg custard tart was interesting with flakes of pastry.,4
great atmosphere and great music played in the store. best place to go for ice cream on a sunny day (or any day) with flavours you won't see anywhere else.,5
everything is pretty in design. flavors were better than average for ice cream. macaroon was average. not like laudure macaroons (but of course i didnt expect that). its more for looks here.,3
"love the ice cream, i got the red velvet flavor. it was delicious. it worth to break your diet for ",5
the ice creams are amazing! staff are very friendly! definitely come try out their ice creams!!,5
"pricy (as expected) but the hk milk tea + hollicks ice cream was probably the best ive had in london! around 4 for two scoops, its enough to share for two people. the macaroon ice creams ran out but i went quite late",5
lovely independent ice cream store.,5
"a new concept of ice-cream sandwiched into macaron which both were delicious but not very practical when it comes to eating it. gets all clumsy, but nice attempt.",3
"it's a nice concept, was expecting the store to be more inviting but to be fair they are refurbishing. i would say, if you are in the neighbourhood definitely try it but dont travel across town for it. very pricy, so more something i would try once.",3
very tasty ice cream with macaron,5
absolutely amazing flavors. plus i personally really like the window spot - perfect spot to have ice cream.,5
"strange but delicious ice cream flavors. you can get it either sandwiched, or in con, cup of different sizes. also you can taste the flavors before you buy.",4
been coming to this place for forever amazing food very well priced would come here every day if i lived closer!!!,5
"the best value for money restaurant we found in london. you have unlimited refills on a big variety asian buffet and everything is tasty. prices are 10,50 if you stay in and cheaper for takeaway.worth it!",5
dessert  food ,4
food was fine but it is very hard to access the buffets.,3
nice food very good taste and sort of friendly stad,5
i visit with my family and her friendsthe foods was ok that chinese style dim sum is fine not to very  but some of them foods is nice duck tongue and not to expensive.,3
the menu in chinese is a hidden gem. great food and reasonably priced.,4
good experience. a bit too small but the food was good.,5
this place is not recommended at all. food was cold and dry,1
food are good. i am from hk. food are almost as good as food in hk. free dessert was served. overall everything is fine,4
"food is alright. love the dim sum, however, the roast duck was served a bit of cold which i believe affected the taste.",3
pricy,3
very good place for authentic cantonese food. my regular restaurant visit everytime i am in london,5
best for dim sums in soho because that is the case can get very busy,4
this for me has always been one of the go-to chinese restaurants in chinatown. my family and i have been frequent customers and the food has always been great and tasty. the prices are more acceptable than a majority of the restaurants down the main street (gerrard street).,5
the waiters were very rude and did not address us properly. they got the order of my food wrong and delayed their service. the waitress then had the audacity to ask for a tip!! overall never again!!,1
decent chinese food in china town coming from an asian. definitely a local place for dim sum and comparatively cheaper than other restaurants in china town. going in the morning for dim sum is recommended,4
"large portions, mediocre quality, poor value for money. chicken is terrible quality. if the menu was 30% cheaper it would have felt fair.",2
"friendly staff and great service. do not expect english waitering though, they express their hospitality here differently. reliable dim sum and cantonese dishes at reasonable prices.",4
tasty frog legs with pepper. vietnamese spring rolls and octopus in spicy sauce are also great dim sum,4
"favourite place for dumplings! (even though i'm not a dumpling expert)but it seems very reasonably priced and portions are huge.don't expect much from the service. it's a fast paced restaurant which just gets things done. no extras, no niceness.oh, 10% off if you pay cash!",4
food is great but the service just feels weird. definitely worth going for the food. just the service cuts it short of 5 stars,4
lovely place to eat best beef curry i have had in a long time,4
amazing dim sum and very generous portions. very fair pricing too. don't miss out!,5
"came here twice now, the food is lovely, quite a lot of choices :) staff is alright",5
disgusting food! dry! not labelled correctly! really greasy! staffs attitude is very poor. would not recommend eating here!,1
not as so good as normal. still 4 star to give them chance for next time ... hope quality is not an issue. see next time..,4
"terrible service, miserable staff who serve like they hate you and act like youve offended them when you ask for water. food gave me food poisoning, terrible bland garbage. do not go here. even mcdonalds has better service and food.",1
amazing chinese good.would recommend.,5
friendly service left alone to make decision instead of hovering with notebook..food tasty left feeling full ...,3
"my favourites were the siew mai, prawn cheong fun and stir fried radish cake. service was kind of lackluster, we ordered two plates egg tarts but the 2nd plate took forever to arrive despite our asking them three times about it",4
very nice banquet meal for four.,5
splendid food!,5
great value authentic dim sum. always efficient service and excellent quality food. top tip - lift the lid of your tea pot and leave askew for a top up of hot water. ,5
"very kind staff, small but complete, the broccoli perfectly cooked, and the noodles...omg loved it. very cheap. if you are fit or so fancy this is not your place, here you could eat (really) good food with your budget.",5
good dining experience and good value for money on the lunch menu.,4
"cosy restaurant, with tasty food. went on chinese new year weekend and although it was busy still was served quickly and food was great. the bbq meat were particularly good here !!",5
please do not go there it is horrible hooorrible rude staff very rude,1
the worst chinese food we've ever had! this has nothing to do with real chinese kitchen! the waitress ignored our complaint...,1
"had the buffet on sunday night after a little day it out in london. food was decent and price not bad, also staff were friendly and helpful. would recommend.",4
great food and service. really liked the duck!great selection of veggie options too.,5
faultless dim sum . xiao long bai better than the fancy places. staff quite old school but also quite lovely.,5
"for the tea the 1 star but only because i have to give a star. worst food in london. service was a joke, they even lacked respect for their customers.",1
the food was good however the service let it all down so much and it smelt like cat,1
we always return here - always lots of chinese customers so  you'd think it'd be good. food ok. service bearable,3
"very nice food. i had a very nice dining experience. would go again. it's cheap, it's good food and the fact that it's cash only didn't bother me at all.",4
fantastic meal. the chicken and black bean sauce is the best around,5
they short changed us and would not admit their mistake. thieves. please avoid this restaurant that actually does theft.,1
"the absolute worst customer service i have ever received in my life. princess leia would probably get better service on the death star, if darth vader waited on her.",1
"the restaurant that i always go to with my family. must try their lobster with ginger and spring onion! also their scallops!i note that some reviews have mentioned that they had buffet food, and therefore rated 1 star. they must have this restaurant confused with another, young cheng are definitely not a buffet restaurant.",5
"price raised, no longer inexpensive, food standard also has decreased, no longer automatic 1st choice.",4
"worst restaurant i've been to in london, service was horrendous, had to wait twenty minutes to pay the bill, then was ok for the price, service charge was a complete joke!! -5 rating",1
"good ginger spring onion lobster. dim sum also fair, above average. good prawn dim sum. we found service to be fine. fairly priced too.",4
my regular and favourite dim sum restaurant in london. the interior is not fancy looking but the food is very authentic and reasonably priced!,5
"i love this place!cheap excellent dim sum (lunch only) the tea is bottomless and i recommend the shrimp and char siu bao fluffy dumplings with their hot and sour soup. get there at 12 noon on weekends, they fill up fast although they have two levels of seating.",5
"the best value and tastiest dim sum in the area i'd say, just don't expect friendly service",4
"pretty fair dim sum for a low price. the trade off is atrociously rude service.  lower your expectations, try not to to take things personally and enjoy some nice dumplings.",3
nice and cheap. good food,4
food tastes terrible,1
"i have to say the staff were extremely rude and  unprofessional, just because the restaurant is gonna be sold soon. the manager even ask the customer not to come back any more. the staff wont serve the customers politely. what a poor job they did!",1
"the food at this place is fabulous. it tastes so authentic and that's what makes the difference. there's a wide choice on the menu to choose from, service isn't bad. it's a bit of a small place with seating on 2 floors. in busy times expect to queue but well worth the wait!",5
"enjoyed the dim sum very much, so delicious and affordable!",5
best value for money dim sum in london,5
"nice food, but most grumpy people ever...",2
"there are always loads of chinese people dining here, which for a chinese restaurant can only be a good sign! ever good value - top food at reasonable prices, with a vibrant atmosphere. highly recommended.",5
"for the most authentic chinese food, this place does not disappoint. wonton noodles soup is massive for the price. avoid lunchtime rush though if you want to walk in without waiting.",5
cheap and cheerful - wouldnt be an authentic chinatown restaurant without slightly rude servers either!,4
"good food, always crowded and waiting for table. waiters serve food quickly hoping customers to finish eating quick and have table ready for next customers!",4
good place for good value plate rice with bbq meats and authentic  dim sum  staff can do with a bit more smiling very busy as prices are lower than surrounding  chinese eateries.  will come again,4
"i could get a better meal out of a tin of whiskers. when the bill come my partner refused to pay the service charge because the meal was so bad  the staff couldn't even understand what we were ordering. pathetic restaurant,  pathetic staff,  pathetic food.",1
"it's used to be good, but now is operating under different management, the quality of food is not as good.",3
"visiting london chinatown for the first time and randomly selected this restaurant. as a taiwanese, the food is delicious. the special fried rice () is surprisingly light(not greasy) but flavorful. cheap eat in london. i remove a star for the service.",4
a nice little order dim sum...clean and full of hungry folks,4
pretty average chinese rest off the main area of gerard street,3
"this is my ""go to"" dim sum place in chinatown. been to many, but always gravitate back here. service is what you'd expect in this type of place, but food is good and reasonable value. have recommended to many who have not been disappointed.",4
"dim sum was excellent, nice staff and keenly priced too.",5
great food,5
"very bad service. waiter/waitress had no manners at all. will not recommend this restaurant. theres one sentence in chinese means dogs eyes look down others, like how they look their customers :) wouldnt give any tips for this kind of service!!! do not waste your time and money for these kind of services. its not that cheap tho.",1
"ate okay but besides one lady, the service was bad.. they came to collect the money of the bill while 2 persons were still eating & couldnt even say thank you when receiving the money... not okay",2
lobster is great here,5
"the food is great a very reasonable prices. i ordered the sweet and sour chicken and the crystal prawn dumplings every time i've been there. i highly recommend both of the dishes, but the service could improve.",4
do not waste your money i didn't want to even give 1 star. we were taken downstairs with less choice of food what was there was cold and tasteless. the staff were very rude and practically threw our drinks at our table. save your money   very very poor quality,1
reasonable dim sum,4
great dim sum served till 5pm,4
"excellent dim sum, very enjoyable",4
amazing dim sum (lunch),5
my sons absolutely hate chinese food. my family wanted to eat here and we were refused. the man said that we had to pay for the boys even if they are not eating! absolutely disgusting! they lost out on 50 because they thought we were going to feed the boys from our plate. shame on them.,1
"good food, all you can eat, nothing to complain about the food from me... just that the hand drier was not working ",4
unassuming outside and inside but very satisfied with food. busy for midweek lunch (queued for about 10 mins). restaurant has 2 levels. what appeared to be chinatown locals eating there is a good sign. will be back next time i'm in chinatown.,4
omg lobster at a reasonable price yummy,5
lovely dim sum and great service as usual,5
we could not use the karaoke and the waiter was rude,2
"the food is great quality here and for a good price. ideal for large groups and casual eating. the seafood is good here. lobster, crab and clams and must orders!",5
food quality really bad ! sorry,1
friendly small restaurant good food,3
for quick noodle soup and some dim sum look no further. lunch menu is great for a quick lunch and dinner menu is also ok as they serve nice sea bass with some dim sum dishes,4
very good  testy  food...enjoyable unpretentious  chinese  resto...family   happily  eating out  ..value for money  all the  way..,4
good arabian food here.,4
delicious roast pork and duck,4
one of the staff was very racist and started yelling in front of everyone when we asked for some white sugar. he was mocking and insulting us asking if we need green sugar or red sugar as well and finally never gave us anything. very racist is what i felt.,1
"one of the best value vs taste in china town. we have been visiting for 20 years, and never disappointed. dim sum and noodle / rice dishes always delicious. space a little crowded. dim sum is to a high standard even compared with restaurants in hong kong.",5
the dimsum were really delicious especially these steamed ones on the list with shrimps. the skin is very thin and crystal clear you can see the ingredients inside.the service was not good i waited 10mins then someone came to my desk to take the order however all dimsum came on the table was hot!,4
fresh crab with noodles. .exciting and yummy.,4
if i could give 0star which its i will. the service was extremely terrible. staff was very unfriendly and rude. food was disgusting greasy and tasteless. it cause reactions to me after 30 minutes. never gonna eat there again not recommending this restaurant,1
we have a late sunday lunch with teenages there. the food quality is good for their price. (9 dishes of dim sum plus fried beef rice noodle in soy sauce for 46) the staff has asked if we have any allergy when taking order. quite considerate. i'll certainly come back again.,5
"fab lobster, amazing meal",5
"3.5 stars if i could because we came here for dinner and the portions size were very good, plenty of chinese folk which is always a good sign! 4 people, a couple of ching tao beers, 4 main dishes including black bean eel roughly 50.. can't argue with that!",3
had takeout from here twice and its definitely on par! fairly fast and efficient service. havent tried their dimsum yet but will do as soon as i get the chance.,5
"on the sunday, i went it was very busy. the food was very good ",4
"all the negative comments here are from people who have no chinese culture awareness. the food is perfectly acceptable for the price range and the location.the service... well, you are in chinatown... what do you expect?!!",4
decent chinese food at reasonable prices ,3
avoid this place. the only good dish was the slice of orange at the end. service - probably the worst in london. never again!,1
"excellent food, normal chinese service, used to that, well worth the money, and staff were very helpful when i said i wanted to take my leftover food home.",5
"all you can eat for only 8,50 great quality",5
okay place but my duck with rice was full of bones and really very greasy.,3
"its a pity theyve closed the one onshaftesbury avenue but this one also offers good value for money increasingly expensive china town, i thought i this place is part of a group that has royal china",4
lovely tasty food.,4
"excellent food, large portions and very well priced for central london.",5
"visited this restaurant many times, the food is always good quality, the new staff are very hit and miss which is a great shame.",4
the rudest people ever. there are plenty of nice places in chinatown. avoid this place,1
"fast service, very good lobster.",5
"valuable, especially for the crab noddle. good cantonese restaurant ",4
"this is a great hidden gem for dim sum. it's just as good, and better in most cases, than even some dim sum places in hong kong. just remember that dim sum isn't served all day, i think they stop serving it at 4pm or something similar (which is actually later than most places as dim sum is usually served at lunch only).",5
prices very reasonable sweet and sour rib especially good and the crab with noodle is very good. the oyster with hot plate is a bit disappointed as the the oyster is small and look like the dry oyster but not fresh oyster.,4
best lobster noodle in london. great value for the price too... ,5
"wow!! this place is awesome, love the staff 5/5!!",5
firmly average in terms of food quality.,3
"don't be fooled by the looks of the restaurant, the food is great here!",4
be prepared for a long wait if you're going for dim sum on the weekend.,4
i love pork buns and i cannot lie,4

"although visited young cheng before, i picked oysters and pork stir fry-big mistake, had the worst tummy ache the next day...bet the oysters were off...but then what did i expect? :( never ordering that dish again...",1
ok good food,4
"disgusting food that made me and my partner feel ill for about 4 hours after, very limited selection of dishes and we were treated like dirt by the staff for asking for water (mainly to balance the fact the food is so laden with salt!) avoid at all costs ",1
waitress was rude and not professional. so we decided not to eat there.,1
delicious and good dim sum,5
delicious food and good wine. ,5

horrible service.,1
"amusingly rude, even by hong kong standards. cheap and good food. got yelled at for asking for chilli oil :-)",3
"abit smallish for a restaurant, dim sum average and indistinguishable like many other in chinatown. price is okay for the quality. can't say much else except sorry if you're stuck here lol, maybe order the char siew soh (char siew puff pastry). it's the only solid thing here for dim sum. ",3
there are better places in china town. ,3
nice place to eat.,3
fresh and excellent seafood,5
"bad service like really bad (if you can get service) very unprofessional. unclean, cold food, dirty dishes!",1
"always make sure i come here for dim sum when i'm in london. the staff are quite brusque but their service is excellent. i've been coming for several years now and the food is always wonderful and cheap for london! as it's just off of leicester square, it's in the perfect location if you want to grab a bite before going to a show!",4
nothing special but not expensive either.,3
great service! we we're very well looked after ,5
"for some reasons, people are standing lines for this restaurant. but to be honest, i didn't like this place. no lie, i found a hair in one of my dish. i saw a cockroach under someone's seat. the waiters are ok, but not friendly. the cheung fan was disappointing.... go to another restaurant. unless you don't mind these things!",1
fabulous chinese food. dim sum from 5pm but all food excellent & set menus have  imaginative choices & good value.,5
very authentic cantonese food and very reasonably priced!,5

this place is horrendous!  below average food and inferior staff. get ready to be sworn at in chinese if u go there. do not go there.,1
good food. quick serving. polite staff,5
my favourite place for lobster noodles. but must ask for extra gravy. the eel is damn amazing too. affordable prices. ,5
"horrible food, rude staff",1
"me and my mother had an incredible lobster at the restaurant yesterday, and we paid excellent price-quality rate. we plan to go again tonight for dinner. we come from spain, so we are used to eat good sea food and we found the one at this restaurant extremely tasty",5
poor service didn't feel welcome,2
best mix of cuisine i have had in a long time.  definitely a top contender for best restaurant in china town.,5
"dim sum is great here. just tick what you want on your paper, which is on your table and it arrives. pretty good price too",5
food is average but as expected. service friendliness isn't great and a once in a blue moon occasion. prices are doable if you're here in a group sharing the dim sum.,3
food was good service also good yes they don't smile but i am not there to be smiled at just eat good food,5
a small restaurant but decent cantonese cuisine. famous for its stewed lobster with ginger and spring onions bedded with deep fried noodles. highly recommend.,4
very good food at young cheng. the decor is typical for china town and the food is great at good prices.,4
"reasonable service, decent food, quick delivery of food.wide variety from independent  meals and dim sum.nothing amazing but decent stop off for something to eat when in china town",3
visited this place on a friday night. amazing and fresh lobster and steamed seabass. the pork and preserved egg congee was perfectly cooked. one of the best chinese restaurants i have tried in london. price is reasonable. service is good. ,5
fabulous chinese food if you order the right dish,4
enjoyed it been before lush again,5
"good for dinner, the crab and rosted pork is very good and the price is reasonable.",4
"decent food, staff were a bit rude.",3
the most authentic dim sum you can get in china town for that price. chinese speakers get free chicken broth! :),5
waiting 40 mins for our starter so left and went elsewhere,1
nice one in chinatown,5
"decent dim sum, not the best in  london. i would class it as distinctly average, 3/5 stars.what gets me to 4 stars is that it is insanely cheap! you can get very full for less than a tenner per person, which is almost unheard of for dim sum in london.",4
"one of the best dim sum in china town, worth the wait in the queue my favourites are prawn dumplings on soup, plain cheung fun and red bean fried dumplings love this place! ",5
"not a massive restaurant but clean with tasty quick dim sum. for a table of 7, the bill came to 10pp. not bad! ",5

please just don't go there. terrible food.,2
amazing dim sum. come with three people so you can have as many different ones as possible. good value. ,5

"the food here were hot and  delicious, the service was fast and the bill was inexpensive.",5
"a busy place, seemed to be more for the locals, which suits me. my first menu was chinese only.... but they brought me an english one when i asked. the food was fresh and tasty, service quick and i loved the bustling, very chinese, atmosphere.",4
"food still have its quality, but service is so bad, could compare to wang kei.... ",2
dim sum and cantonese dishes excellent value,4
the best dim sum in chinatown. decent a la carte menu as well although i'd definitely recommend the dim sum more. ,5
went there to try the lobster noodles. wasn't as awesome as other people have suggested. not amazing and not a lot of lobster meat,2
"i'm from the states so i know bad chinese food, but this really takes the cake",1
"slow service, poor hygiene, did not get what we ordered but charged for it. argued when we would not pay  service charge. quality of ingredients very poor. anywhere is better.",1
always a winner. might not be award winning but for the price of dim sum they're charging you couldn't be happier with it. it's delicious and cheap.,5
yes.,5
"looks nice from outside,  i was walking by",3
great chicken and always tasty. super busy,5
chinese new year is coming and is always good to visit chinatown,4
