a great place for dim sum.,5

pho tasted like pho but lacked some of the herbs. portions were pretty small.,3

quaint place in the center of the city,3

"fascinating, but still just a gate ",4
"great chinese restaurant providing quite a lot of dishes to choose from. the service was quick and prompt..  the beef ho fun is a really lovely dish to try. the mixed meat and sea food ho fun is also quite a treat containing prawns, squids , chicken , beef , pork , and loads more... food bloggers this is a place you gotta try out",5
"good dimsum, attentive service.",5
not up to standard of previous occasions,3
"it used to be my favourite place but after the last visit i got very disappointed...  all wrong!  bad cocktails, bad or no service at all...  pity ",1
really authentic chinese place. we ordered 4 dishes and rice and it was more than plenty for 3 people. juices weer delicious. ,5

lots of variety. very tasteful,5
the food here is amazing. it has such a fresh and flavoursome taste. it is a truly delicious experience! the staff are quite nice and price is not bad either.,5
"right in the heart of chinatown, shame they can't have a larger space because the cashier is right by the door, which means sometimes you'll be waiting in the rain. they have a great selection of flavours and there's generally new seasonal items to try if you visit often",5
the tori karaage with rice tastes great with a really reasonable price! i also ordered tempura and it's also good. the staff there are also friendly.,5
staff ok good range of drinks good atmosphere but staff not massively welcoming,3
"nice staff and friendly, okay place to chill for very late nifhts",3
unfriendly atmosphere. ,2
so glad i dont live in london otherwise i would spend all my money  here and get really fat. best doughnuts ive ever had. when i visit london i always get a six-pack,5
"really love their custard buns! their cream buns, lotus buns, red bean buns and spring onion and ham buns are also tasty! it can get busy at times, but it isn't too bad unless you go during the holiday period or during 6pm+ on the weekends. the staff aren't the friendliest but they arent super rude or anything.",5
"great irish bar that looks deceiving from outside, inside is huge with several levels and also has cosy nooks.  there was live music on and so was busy and thankfully we had booked the whole mezzanine area for our team & the food was excellent and everyone had a great time, though bar service could have been faster.",4
love the tayaki!!! probably the most authentic ones you can get in london! and other pastries look amazing too- just like what you would get back home.,5
rubina is amazing! she made me feel at ease when i was so nervous about starting the treatment. she explained everything very well to me and took away all my doubts. she is also a lovely person and im delighted to be having my treatment with her.,5
very rude staff and dont accept cards,1
"they are rude, no manners, food us horrible never ever going to visit this ""place"" .",1
whenever i crave dumplings i always quickly stop by here. they always taste amazing. the only thing i don't like is that you can only pay by cash.,4
love it here,5
great spot .. been 4 times since moving here. love it. fresh  food.. really nice staff.. inexpensive too. a must if you've a hankering for vietnamese food,5
"friendly bar stuff, tasty food and good price. i'll return more times.",5
yes! a whole mushroom,5
great display of the cakes but they were only ok when we tasted them.,3
the food is good but not worth the amount you are paying-quite pricey. staff were friendly and gave us an extra dish free of charge when they made a mistake (gave us the sauce after we finished eating it) with the original dish. nice ambiance compared to other chinese restaurants.,3
"been going to lido off and on for probably 15-20 years now and unlike most chinatown dim sum restaurants it has remained consistently good for dim sum items. has all the traditional dim sum dishes that i like and service is generally very quick, with the exception of getting the bill strangely enough.",4
watched the football in comfort with a fairly pricey but tasty fish & chips with leffe.,5
they have a secret room downstairs so even if it looks crowded ask for table you will propably get one.,4
worst dim sum i have ever eaten,1
classic and nostalgic taste...though the egg tarts are not perfect i still enjoy a lot for what i paid for. ,5
good quality food at reasonable price. clean and friendly.,5
"the best place to eat at chinatown: the food is delicious, especially the chicken and the dim sum; the staff is fantastic and the place is clean and cozy. i have become a regular and i am always welcomed with a smile!",5
"don't order crispy duckgave us some microwave-food-quality stuff, small portion, shredded into pieces, and charged us 9 pounds. service was bad, took forever to even order, other dishes were mediocre. ",1
"delicious, fast and pleasant!",5
one of the best irish venues in central,5
really awesome experience here. very authentic and tasty dim sum. don't forget egg tarts!,5
"we were walking past and were drawn in by the lotus stem crisps on display - it did not disappoint! i've never eaten lotus stem crisps before and these were simply delectable. you are given an option of 10 different seasonings, i went with the garlic and thai seasoning. absolutely yummy- cant wait to go back.",5
"nice food , good size portions but pour service.",3
it's a nice place for cheap drinks and live music .,4
the chicken craquer is fantastic. the food is good. it's not expensive the prices are good,4
"2nd time visiting and by far the best chinese i have ever eaten. little more expensive than other places chinatown, but definitely worth it. one of the few 5 stars i have given.",5
dirty and crowded ,2
"good place during the day when it's quiet. not a stereotypically rowdy rough boy place. seats are uncomfortable though, probably on purpose in a bid to get get you to leave sooner for a higher customer turnover. food is good as well.",4
good food nice service ,4
dissapointing. wish we'd looked around first and chose a different restaurant. all decent food in window. but nothing that impressive. not clean and flies. overpriced meal for what it was. didn't really fancy a 2nd plate. low standard food,2
"very rude waitress. told us to leave when we were still enjoying our tea after our meal (we paid 4 for the tea). she told us many people were waiting downstairs and we had to leave. when we went downstairs theres no queue, in fact theres no one waiting at all.",1
good food but don't buy any veg dish as 9 for a small plate of some greens is a total rip off. they should be ashamed charging the same as a main dish. shame as otherwise it's ok.,3
crispy chicken breast is good and the strawberry green tea is really nice!! win win.,5
"i loved the food here. every meal i have had was delicious. the food made me remind of home and the ambience was very comfortable. a bit pricy, but it's worth the money. would recommend to everyone!",5
"fun to walk around. we missed the fresh food markets, spices and natural remedies. a majority of the places where restaurants.",4
"terrible service. waiters are rude, not welcoming and frowning all the time. dont recommend this place to anyone wanting  to try chinese food. wine tastes like water and food is cold.",1
"food is well prepared, reasonable size sharing portions. israeli/mediterranean tapas style with well balanced flavours. hands down best tahini dip ive had, the octopus is tender and easily the best dish on the menu. if you can, sit at the bar, watching the action adds to the experience.",5
great service! the girls were very friendly and my nails look perfect! highly recommend. ,5
very cool and fun waffles,5
"probably the best dumplings in london, but bd has also a lot more to offer: i like to order something different every time and it never disappoints me!",5
absolutely amazing. i loved all the food we got. service was very fast and very nice atmosphere. we arrived without a booking and got seated immediately. the best restaurant i've tried in chinatown so far.,5
products are great but the customer service needs work at shaftesbury ave.,3
"the golden phoenix provides authentic chinese cuisine in an atmosphere that is not cramped, and a cut above most of the other restaurants in the area. you may have to pay a small premium per dish over others prices, but in my view, it is well worth it for the comfort and quality.",5
best restaurant in chinatown,5
great korean bbq don't be afraid to drink the suju,5
"the restaurant is quite small, but the food is good.",5

food is good lovely service,5
"the food is good but not hygienic and uncomfortable to eat, tables too close, staff is kind (a change for chinese restaurants).",3
best lymphatic drainage massage ever! very professional sympathetic and above 10 stars,5
excellent. my 'once a month' hangout. the dishes are just so tasty and they don't hold back on the portions,5
fine drinks,5
"not a great experience, overpriced food and dodgy service. avoid this place.",1
"basic chinese food, nothing special",3
"very nice chinese restaurant. beautiful food. uniquely decorated, with a bridge over little river and fish at the entrance. there were christmas parties in smaller rooms and people seemed enjoying themselves there. we had a lovely dinner. the waiter was very friendly and helpful.",5
very helpful staff to a new customer,4
one of the best hamburgers on the planet,5
"overpriced for what they do - average interior, average rushed service, not impressive cocktails and too expensive overall. save your money for other places that work hard for you to enjoy!",2
dirty,1
"nice place. tasty food at affordable, non-rip-off rates. friendly staff who were very forthcoming when i kept asking for more of their hotsauce.!",4
"if you can, try to get a table downstairs. it's like a whole new world down there with dim lights, music like karaoke and great atmosphere for couples night. their dim sum is something to look out for at lunch time. i do find that they have better options on the menu for that.",4
"legendary eatery, just don't use the loo's.",5
never been before but loved it. all the food tastes amazing. expect it to be busy but we were seated quite quickly!,5
cheap but very very poor quality!!,2

fanatic dim sum. great value. don't be put off by the queue. it moves quickly.,5
their curry laksa is very tasty just a bit too oily...,4
delicious dim sum till late (but cheong fun finishes at 5pm),5
"food very good, but the waiters are in your face.all the time, they need to stand back and letyou enjoy your meal, soon as you put a glass down it's gone.stand back waiting staff, let the customer enjoy the meal.",3
great cakes love this shop,5
"it's very busy on most of the occasions i've been there so the service is a bit slow but good food, and the dim-sum and dumplings are reasonably priced and portions too... so my recommendation is that decide what to have from the menu outside and order asap after you have been seated...",4
pretty good still food quite weird,4
halal restaurant. beef rendang and nasi lemak was fantastic! desserts are to an acquired taste but nice still.,5
cosy place with great dessert and friendly staff. best after a nice meal in chinatown.,5
good quality food,5
"you can find most east asian ingredients you need to cook here. it covers everything japanese, thai, chinese, to korean, indonesian and malaysian.",3
"it's probably more than 20 years since i was last at wong kei (back when i actually thought it was called  wonkey's ). the food is still fantastic and reasonably priced, but the staff are nowhere near as, er, ""abrupt""  as they used to be. this place is great, and you should go.",5
delicious custard bun and veggie bun. very filling!,5
great food and atmosphere. interesting range of dishes.,5
in comparison with competitors prices are too high for the quality of food served. i would in fact expect to pay much less for this mediocre (at best) food. especially considering that service and appearance are lacking too.,2
"it was nice, there was bubble tea and chinese buns like the surprise meat bun and hawaiian bun too.",5
"eat good, cheap and as much as you want. we were delighted with mr wu's food. it was all really tasty and with such a low price for all you can eat service, you will definitely not leave disappointed!",5
nice cakes,4
interesting architecture. gives you a feeling of actually being in asia,5
eeal thai food in london,5
my favorite korean bbq restaurant.,5
"service is very slow. once we ordered our chicken serviced cold, send it back and once again t arrived cold. really would not recommend eating here the staff are always in a hurry.",1
special,5
i've only had the dumplings but they were very good and fresh. the place is certainly nothing special decor/service-wise but it's a great place to pop in for a few plates of dumplings and get out quickly.,4
it was nice fast service although was very busy perfect for late dinner as not much restaurants opens there in this quality,4
tasty and very quick staff,5
top notch. sit at the counter. i live in nyc but when im in london palomar is a must,5
great little pub with an upstairs. not too pricey for a london boozer,5
best boba in chinatown...,5
tasty dishes - good service,4
"small, slightly hidden, but very chic-feeling bar. an intimate-feeling space with friendly and attentive waitresses and bartenders who know their business well. a decent-sized menu filled with delicious drink served beautifully. if you like floral, definitely try their violet gin fizz; violets are blue.",5
mediocre food. poor service. tourist trap.,3
bubble bloomin' tea. why not!,5
super delicious fried chicken breast.,5
"good food, friendly staff and fair prices. sushi didn't blow me away but would go again.",4

28  it was good,5
"delicious chicken curry buns and fried dough sticks.  the custard fish are to die for! the bakery is self service, its quite easy to get carried away and start piling on the breads as soon as you grab a tray and tongs. the prices are good for the quality of product and your items are packed well.",5
"i went there because i was craving baozhi/buns but they were really bad, warmish, way too much bun and the filling was small yet alright but not as tasty as i'm used to. and the staff was not really welcoming...",1
"really lovely attentive service, good food",5
really cool hidden bar through an unassuming door off china town.,4
very ordinary,2
chinatown is the best place to visit for eating and buying asian products. the restaurants are obviously good here. lots of restaurants to pick from.,5
"i have been to opium countless times and i continue to go back because it is brilliant. the ambience is spot on (very moody and dimly lit), the cocktails are superb and the dim sum is delicious. such a great place to go with friends. and to top it off, the doorman is a legend.",5
"this is a terrible franchise nobody makes any money, they just keep putting up the prices, it is impossible to make money",1
"rude staff, mediocre food",1
great piece of home while away,5
the food was very good. the service was extremely good and friendly. we were advised very well what to choose and what not. we will be back if brexit allows us.,5
bing su is amazing. come here and get bing su. the katsu curry is also one of the best in london. bing su.,5
great desserts which is always fill of people,4
beautiful and happening place. you won't even feel that you are in london as it would seem like a mini china in the heart of london city.,4
"love this branch because their staff is the best. they sing live and they are extremely talented, young people.",5
nice choice of oriental teas,4
"was there for cny, great atmosphere but very crowded",4

huge portions that hits the spot,4
"sounds creepy, but you can stand outside of the restaurant around lunch time to watch them make chinese dumplings. it's kinda mesmerising.",4
this was a great experience! never expected to see something so different then the rest of london,5
"probably the most hong kong place of all of chinatown. authentic char siu and pork belly, add some vegetables and a milk tea, and you might just think youre in the fragrant harbour for a second! service is also authentic (read: quick, efficient and impersonal). reasonably priced.",5
nothing to write home about.,2
"all my favourites in the cafe, variety of tastes and styles.  in hot or cold desserts.",5
genuinely authentic malaysian food!,5
the food was good but my reason to put only 2 stars is because the dishes are not washed properly and just wiped with wet towel which make me to asking my self ..... who was eated  before me? i am really disappointed what i saw today.,2
friendly & efficient service on a busy friday night. tasty food at a reasonable price.,5
good. free green tea. mushy rice...perhaps overcooked. but main course and appetizers were tasty. nothing earth shattering but good food.,4
"the crispy chili beef is so tasty - with saffron rice, great pork rib soup and egg tarts to go!",5
"i normally go to t4 for bubbletea but when i am around chinatown, i will go to this shop which is still good.",4
cocktail bar in the heart of china town playing relaxing vibes,3
"great little cafe, with comfort chinese food at low prices. recommend the handmade section (noodles and dumplings)",4

amazing bun  perfect pho,5
good food at a reasonable price considering central london. friendly staff.,4
don't order the wagyu burger! they completely overcook the meat (some parts were burnt). complained to the waiter and they explained this is the way they do it. what a waste of good food!,2
"meh, food wasn't amazing but really pricey. they also messed up several times what we ordered. cocktails were also added to our check which we didnt have. we ended up being super over billed but that was sorted at the end...the staff was nice though.",2
bad dessert and unpleasant service,1
fabulous restaurant: great service and tasty. authentic food with lots optionswe had been recommended by friends. will definitely come back.,5
great ambiance good food,4
both ladies were so helpful and friendly. ice cream was incredible (try the queso bun) the girls and i loved it!,5
"good store, bit confusing since staff from the other shop come in.",4
"the food was microwaved i felt sick for 2 days.i had rice noodles with different types of fish ,the water where the noddles were served in had the same consistency of gravy,the fish was really rubbery,the leaves they put on the plate felt like slime,it was just awful.",1
"what a hidden gem, many flights of stairs up from an unassuming jade door in the middle of china town there's exists a haven from the crowds where you can enjoy exquisite cocktails in a relaxed atmosphere.",5
"the food was okay,  i've had better. check your bill as they tried to charge us for a glass of wine we didn't have",2

huge selection of asian food. if you can't find it here it doesn't exist,5
we love stocking up here when in london,5
fab food and hospitable servers. worth every penny,5
really like chinatown. regularly go for the supermarkets as well as the restaurants,5
one stop shop for all your chinese groceries.  but it's become a maze with narrow aisles and packed to the brim with shoppers so not really convenient for a large shopping trip with full shopping baskets.,3
top notch noodles and much much more,5
fast food chicken taken up a notch with the plum seasoning!,5
"good dim sum menu, fast service and child friendly restaurant. reasonable prices and decent portions. central location right in the middle of chinatown, a buzzing place for tourists and foodies. within easy access to london underground.",4

one of the best dim sum places in chinatown. would easily give five stars if the loos weren't gross. ,4
"get together among friends.. highly recommended, book a table if four or more as you will be seated down stairs, restaurant is cozy but the vibe can be loud depending on the night and guests, they have a la carte & set menus.. lovely dishes, ambience & most of all customer service :)",5
"was recommended this place by a colleague, quite hidden away and all the way upstairs but once inside, you feel very cosy. the music playing was 80s which was very different and nice (i'm an 80s-90s kid). it does remind me of japanese restaurants which are hidden away all the way upstairs via narrow stairs. the cocktails were nice.",4
beef soup was mostly water. when i asked for the bill i was told there was a minimum charge of 10 gbp to pay by card. nowhere in the restaurant did it say this. it seems like the kind of place that gets away with low quality (in food and service) because it relies largely on tourists.,1
still the best value for money and taste in chinatown,5
"have received an excellent service from the team, in particular ruby, who is very knowledgeable and competent. booking and rescheduling is super easy and the team is very flexible. highly recommended.",5

"dirty, luke warm food.  no card facilities. ",2
"great dim sum. just good, basic dim sum, nothing fancy or fusion. there was a wait but we got in pretty fast. it has several floors and so is biggest than it appears. staff was nice and efficient.",5
excellent food!good service !not expensive !,5
"people complaining about the tiny portions, get with program youre in central bloody london what do you expect. this chinese is as good as any other in china town so take it or leave it. it filled us up nicely before my wifes tattoo.",4

best schezwan in town.. a must in london for chinese food lovers..,5
"thought it was supposed to be quite good dumplings, especially xiao long bao. they were the driest xiao long baos i have had. maybe because it was lunchtime, but beware!",1
absolutely shocking. found a hair in the food. poorly kept restaurant. avoid.,1
the chicken breast is really tasty and not at all greasy. i also bought the drumsticks but the chicken breast is really the star of the show. it is on the pricey side but it is located in central london.i would definitely come back here again.,4

not very tasty and quite expensive,3
"would give this 5 stars, however music inside was unnecessarily loud (and that's coming from a student) and my partner and myself almost felt intimidated by the atmosphere, especially given off by the staff. other than the it was a very nice bar to be in aesthetic wise and the drinks were amazing",4
nice place good restaurants... beware of buffets they are not good,4
great staff but food needs a update,2
one of the biggest tourist attractions in london. great food and lots of other chinese colture goodies.open nearly 24 hours with great night life and.,5
very rude and unhelpful staff. bread doesn't taste fresh and no expiry or best before date. found a piece of scourer in the bread.,1
"tired food and overpriced. in a street full of decent chinese restaurants, this isnt one.",2
"food is below average, very expensive. service is good, won't go back again.",1
the dirty boba with oat milk was incredible. best boba i've ever had. the cakes are out of this world; light as a cloud and so delicious. definitely worth checking out! ,5
"decent food, good ambience, terrible service",4
"got the halo halo and the ice cream bun, was good.  although we couldn't finish the halo halo fast enough so the ice melted and watered it down.",4
wooden panelling helps soothe away the pain of paying 7.50 for 2/3rds of a pint. as does the 7.2% abv speciality ale you accidentally ordered because you can't pronounce any of the names. 5/5.,5
my first time having korean bbq i will definitely have it again when i get the chance,5
excellent quality and value indonesian food,5

excellent if you need a break from walking around london town,5

"food is always delicious, big servings and good service - seating could be a lot better but i get that's part of the traditional look they're going for inside",5
i like cocktail there,4
"the worst custard tarts i have tasted. soft, slimey texture and rancid oil flavour. inedible",1
"great tasting cocktails and a real experience to see them being made. nice atmosphere, really enjoyed the experience",5
"great for many different asian supplies, organised by county, good selection of cooking utensils in the back.",4
amazing place for a foot massage!,5
"the man at the door was a miserable bugger, the waiters were all solemn faced, pretty much sums up this place and it's food. i ordered crispy chilli beef, whatever the meat was that turned up certainly was not beef and it was absolutely stone cold. i left here just as hungry as i came in. disgusting",1
"yes, just yes, pork buns...oh my god",5
love this place. informal dining. you end up sitting at a table with other people and soon make friends. food is great. love chinese food.,5
"like find a gem in the heart london! tasty foods with a great price. the foods only cost arount 4,5-7,5 pounds, and you will get a huge portion. the service was good and was fast. however, it receives cash only, and some staff need to be more friendly. overall, two thumbs up and recommended!",4
this place is buzzing early hours of the morning in the heart of china town. famous for a few dishes this place is highly recommended for couples and even groups.,5
"perfectly fine, but im sure there are other places in chinatown that are better. food was a bit bland",3
nice place to sit. unfortunately there wasn't any food served today(( glogger guus on his world tour)),3
"ok for essential, can be pricy.",3
so unusual and so good. this restaurant has such a comforting lush oriental class. you feel like you've been transported across the globe to another country and i guess that's the idea. food and drinks were both superb. staff could be friendlier and some of them would be more suited working in a gp surgery.,4
too expensive for 1person...they changes the menu which is really small portion but big money..i will not go back again ,1
"the food is very nice, the boss must train staffs to behave appropriately n serve more properly instead of throwing plates, spoons or food onto customers table.",3
"fries were really good, burgers are tasty but a bit small for the price and there aren't too many options to customise (most burgers are a variation of the same ingredients)",4
"really good. our go to place. decently priced, good big portions and tasty.",5
"my go to place for delicious malaysian food! can get really busy at times but that just attest how good that place is. a recommended place to eat. just remember the seating can get a little cramped, so you can feel as if you're dining with another unknown person ",5
attention you have to pay for service 12.5% it is mandatory.  the meal was satisfactory.,1
great food.....worth visiting,4
nice place with a large choice.,4
"awful customer service, won't be going back",1
"great ""all you can eat"" chinese buffet, very reasonably priced but try to get a seat upstairs as the atmosphere is better",5
holy s***.  do yourself a favor and eat here.,5
nice bubble tea,5
"tiny, tasty, cheap chinese bakery with no space, no service, and halfway around the world from the golden gate (san francisco). frequently sold out of items, so pick from whatever is put out.",4
"awesome area , every tourist should visit it",5
food was decent but the service was terrible. downright unfriendly i'd say. ,2
always great beer and wine and love the live music on sunday's,5
loved this place such a creative way to have a waffle. with such scrumptious flavours. i love that you can create your own and the fact that they had vegan options,5
"a new place we accidentally found. great service, very considerate. even the mocktails were great, bar tender explained us to detail about the ingredients used. :)food was good as well, especially the fish in bananaleafs. that was really a pleasant surprise.",5
show de rock. ambiente muito legal.,5
love their bubble tea.best place in london.,5
needs more customer assistance. ,2

"comida muy buena y abundante a precio razonable. comimos muy agusto, sin duda lo recomiendo!",5
best fried chicken,5
"good taiyaki ice cream.  had the matcha and vanilla mix.  matcha was light and not too strong, complimented well.  also great that the ice-cream didn't make the taiyaki soggy.",4
nice cantonese cuisine to enjoy in a rather charming ambience,4
nice guinness,4
cheap and easy but be prepared to be moved tables during your meal. we used to eat here a lot. the food is fine and the menu extensive. you might get put on a large group table anywhere on the three floors. it's an experience and you'l know if you like it or not very quickly!,4
it was good but i got stressed while ordering my food.,4
amazing chinese restaurant with great services and yummy food! not to mention it is a super great value too! never go to other dim sum place! only super star!,5
"it's cool place, careful with pick pocking.  good places to eat and buy stuff.",5
the popcorn chicken is great,4
"nice authentic chinese restaurant, unexpectedly delightful. we ordered the fish in chilli oil which was just perfect. definitely have it with some rice and greens to offset the intensity of the chilli oil.",4
"awesome cocktails, don't miss out!!",5
good bubble tea but had to wait 15mins to make it,4
authentic chinese food.,4
always packed on weekends but it's understandable because restaurants and takeaways need to buy stock but combined with family doing their weekly shop its packed like hell. so avoid if you can on those days. all in all it has all the stuff you need from an asian supermarket without having to go to chinatown. ,3
best oriental food shop in central london.,5
food was a nice mixture of authentic middle eastern dishes and flavours combined with some innovative twists. the pappardelle pasta was really tasty and the sweetbread were especially good.,4
?!?! ,1
very good vietnamese food. we are traveling a lot. this place make us feel back to vietnam. thank you!,5
it is a cool bar/restaurant with a lively bar counter and a separare dessert counterat the front and a seating area at the back. the food is mediterranean and israeli style. there are tapas dishes and also mains. service is friendly and the bartender fixes up a mean cocktail.,4
best pho in london!,5
"good portion sizes, tasty food and reasonable prices for central. there is sometimes a queue that leaves the door during busy periods, but wait times no longer than 15-20 mins in my experience.",5
cosy little japanese restaurant. excellent soba noodles.,5
junk. paid 4.40 for a iced lemon tea and it tasted artificial. definitely will not be going back. starbucks or costa thank you very much.,1
very tasty love the ice cream,5
"great place for fun. there is a good bar on the ground floor, i learned that there are promotions and you can get free cocktails and a private room for an hour. to do this, you need to register on 909gay,com, create a profile and just show it to the administrator. i have done it. cool when you get these bonuses",5
dirty and run down,1
very enjoyable meal,5
"nice cosy small place with great flavour bao & other asian food. good atmosphere and friendly service, would definitely recommend if passing through the area",4

ho fun noodle that was served is not freshly cooked,1
"what can one say? if they are not rude, then they've lost the plot! so, cheap but absolutely exciting food and rude service is a perfect combination to get sober on a friday night! i never get disappointed with wing kei - over the past 30 years! a symbol of great chinese food in soho!",3
really exceptional buns and flavours. must have a custard bun.,5
"small factory with a tiny shopfront selling fresh rice noodles, turnip cake, various sweet and savoury baos and dimsum at the friendliest price! 5 mins in the steamer and you have all the dimsum favourites at less than half the restaurant prices!",5
the ice cream is a must have when visiting china town.,5
not a big fan of chinese food... the scallop dumplings were absolutely delicious.great place for dim sum my husband ordered the crispy duck pancakes but it was way too dry.,4
great food. nice ambience. value for money,5
what an amazing pub! great atmosphere and space. absolutely loved it -,5
"surly, uninterested staff, with the young ones message on their mobile phones, rather then being attentive between serving dishes to the table. the older supervisors, apathetic in the main i find but the food perfectly adequate.",1
food is bad and the service is worst. there are plenty of places there avoid this place.,1
you can pretty much find anything here.,4
"good service, nice food, den of iniquity",5
"explosion of flauver from middle east with a fresh mediterranean touch.  the brioche bread is to die for, the israeli head chef knows very well how to play with flavours and spices. i loved it! i will be back",5

"very nice place, good prices, big portions and delicious food.",5
"went there with my hubby as part of our romantic weekend away from our children. the food was good, its the only reason i am giving it 2 stars. but the service was so bad that we felt like we were not welcome there. we left as quickly as we finished our first order. we end up having to go to another place for another meal.",2
"was just turned away from from this casino by a very rude bouncer, who accused me of being drunk, when all i'd drank was green tea, at the lanzhou lamian restaurant in by leicester square station. very disappointed",1
service is really bad. staff have no interest in serving you. forgot our order 3 times !!!!,1
experience top! top food! and first of all grande ilaria!,5
"food was good, but not exceptional and smart attire is strictly enforced. despite the attire rule, it wasnt particularly fashionable. good for corporate events, not great for an intimate, truly unique dining experience.",2

i cant recommend this place enough. authentic thai flavoured dishes and service was lovely.,5

amazing venue outstanding show,5

"the gate to chinatown, brimming with restaurants, bakeries, street entertainment and the hustle and bustle. bring your camera, you don't want to miss it, gorgeous to see.",5
vegetarian soup with meat in it???,1
yummy food for an affordable price for sure. portions are of a very decent size and the staff were quite efficient.,5
this excellent value. food is good. service is efficient. they want you in and out so they can get the next customer in. if you're in a rush this is good. can get very busy at peak times.,5

great service and food but the place and furniture needs an upgrade.,4

hot bartender+not bad for some fun. ,4

"you can drink, eat, dance, listen life music. what you need more to spend great evening.",5
"service is about as bad as it gets! no one knows what they are doing and mostly children running the place. food is fairly good for a buffet, but very much cheap and cheerful-ish kind of place",2
"great waffles with a bunch of options, they have something for every palate. the only downside is the line that is out the door, about a 20 minute wait to get your waffle.",4
"ignorant doorman (both upon entering and leaving), poorly mixed old fashioned (too harsh and orang-y), re-heated dim sum which was cold in the middle. unfriendly service, overall very disappointing.",1

an institution. i love it.dont forgetting visit upstairs!,4
crystal is the entire reason id go back. intelligent staff. open. great cocktails. get yourself a kota.a cocktail that takes 2 days to make. get to the door and say the place was recommended. well worth the time and money.,5
big place and good music,4
best tasting bubble tea ive had in london so far,5
"dimsum was great. the main dishes, not so much. service was even worse. waiters have no clue what they are doing, garbled english, and the toilet floor was covered in urine as the urinal was leaking. stay away!",1
"for a place called shake shack, you'd expect a damn good shake and these do not disappoint. at a reasonable price, the team will guide you through the ordering process. our shakes were amazing (not one for slimming world!).cleanliness was not great when we visited though. sticky floors and tables and the toilets really unpleasant.",4
dont like the west end. dont like this pub.,2
my daughter loves their bubble tea,5
"food excellent, pleasant surroundings, trouble communicating with staff on order",3

better go to mc donalds - tasteless burgers,1
fresh dim sum. really quick services and packed with people. prepare to wait for a while for a table and food.,4
good supermarket but small space can get really crowded it smells bad and be aware of pickpockets in the shop and on the town.,5
some of the best cakes and coffee in london.,5
best bubble wrap! ,5
great rock salted cheese bubble tea! unique and very addictive!,5
yummy matcha snowdae (shaved milk ice). server was quite unfriendly but overall a pretty good experience.,4

amazing range of drinks,5
"what a drink! i never had that kind of tea drink, bad azz!",4
"gtrat place to get your asian groceries, lots of variety in your typical asian supermarket fashion. staff aren't that friendly, and prices are london prices, but compared to waitrose, sainbury it's much better value for your asian foods. just a pity it's far away so i can only go once / week.",4
"excellent service all the way from booking a table until the end of the meal. very authentic chinese meals. dinner for two or large groups, no problem. set menu choices are varied and tasty and a good way to introduce the wonderful culinary experiences of chinese cuisine.",5

"favourite chinese in china town . elegant , clean superb service. the food is excellent very tasty. you know it's good when the chinese eat here.",4
"awoid this place at all cost!! the menu says nothing about the food ie dumpling in soup turned out to be dumplings in pure water, hot & sour soup turned out to be somethings super sweet with a jelly like consistency and on top of that there was an egg shell in my beef stew!! utterly disgusting!!",1
amazing night out. been there both friday and saturday. would for sure go to cafe de paris more often,5
"amazing bingsu, reminded me of the countless times i visited sulbing () in seoul... and this rivaled, or maybe bettered, the flavours!",5
"the food was ordinary, no fancy place, too fast delivery of the food and it could have more spices.",3
little gem in london's chinatown. looks like nothing special at first glance but the food we had was seriously good and so was the vietnamese coffee. cheap and hassle free. nothing fancy but definitely recommend if you want good vietnamese food at good value.,5
"just awesome! great selection of beers, and their vegan beyond burger is out of this world! great vibe and great service!",5
"perfect for a quick stop for deserts. place is very cosy and chilled! we had the bubble tea, one of the fruity house desserts, and a waffle. price is quite fair. i would definitely recommend going for a bubble tea and one of their house desserts. many choices to try from. their waffle wasnt that great.",5
excellent cakes,5
food was very nice. service rushed and staff a bit rude,3
i ate dim sum here today. i had great expectations coming in because it looked very busy and had a queue. but the food arrived cold (which was suppose to be hot) and the place was not very clean. the food was too greasy and i had a stomach ache & felt sick after i left.,1
"very authentic vietnamese cuisine! i totally recommend the ban cuon (steamed pork rice rolls), the xeo pancake and my all time favourite sate pho. the seating on the right it is a bit cold so i recommend to wait for a table inside but otherwise it is worth the wait!",5
it was amazing,5
do not expect michelin star service or gordon ramsey presentations. this place is just glorious for its rough and simple atmosphere and the excellent quality of food.,5
great for trying all of the weird foods there are to offer,5
"really good chinese food, recommend to everybody. the crispy aromatic duck was amazing, but don't underestimate, half the duck is more than enough for 4 people.",5
"overpriced, rude service, high service fee that isn't communicated before, dirty looking restaurant. the food was ok and a lot. conclusion: don't go there, you will be disappointed.",1
cheap and normal taste,5
great ho fun,5
"love the bubble tea. it's become a ritual now. everytime i go to leicester square,  i do end up visiting cuppacha for a bubble tea. a good variety of flavored teas.",5
food ok. customer service could be better.,3
lovely staff great cocktails,5
"the blue posts the best live music possible in london, the band the fallen heroes brilliant and band members absolute gentlemen",5
dirty place with very rude waitress who spilt condensed milk all over the floor and me! didnt apologise or even mop up the floor. would not recommend.,1
"was craving a singaporean laksa while i was visiting london. c & r hit the spot with a tasty laksa, exactly what i needed.",5
really nice mediterranian mixed food. portions are small but carefully prepared.there is that pasta dish which we really liked. must try!service was excellent.a little bit pricy but worth it.,5
quick efficient and most of what i need is here.,4
exceptionally good and friendly chinese restaurant.,5
really good soup dumplings with thin pastry.,5
"foods mediocre, or below average. rice is undercooked, staff is cantonese speaking, what you would generally expect from a chinatown restaurant.",2
"bilog with ube flavored icecream! it was my first time to try out some philipino desserts and it was a delicious experience. the portion is quite big (well, considering the value you pay for it, it should be like that). its better to share the piece with your friend! the ube taste was quite rich, totally to my expectations!!",4
foods was nice last time so i come to have lunch again and i and my bf have big stomach from food poisoning. i havent had anything else today. prob they used old oil or the foods was old,3
"went in on a busy saturday, was shown to a table and given menus. 5 minutes later a waiter came up to us, we assumed to take our order, only to be told that someone had already booked the table and would we like to sit downstairs instead? given service like that we chose to leave and eat elsewhere altogether.",1
"one of my favourite restaurants in london. it's tiny so do make a reservation (or come late for standing bar seating). but the flavours are bold, the dishes inventive and the atmosphere charming and energetic. love it!",5
some of the best dim sum in town. nicely hidden from the street so is a great place if you find it,4
my fave chinese restaurant. friendly staff and nice food. been going here for years.,5
very good food however very pricey. me and my friend paid 40 each for buffet hotpot which was supposed to be 26 each.,4
decent place. affordable price. roast duck was definitely not the best.,4
oh love the unique idea of bubble wrap waffles and  gelato...i had a customized apple pie waffle with strawberry cheesecake gelato.. sprinkled with kitkat and white chocolate..it was simply amazing..!!,4
good club but on saturday is packed ,3
"tried their crispy chicken and oyster noodles, both delicious. menu with pictures is a great help",3
went there a few times for a haircut it was ok but the last time it was absolutely horrendous. ,1
good cocktails list with very great staff. only issues are lack of space to stand when all the seats are gone.,3
lacks poker ta,4
campylobacter alert. wouldn't eat here.,1
"preferred chinese supermarket in chinatown, less cramped than the competition and a wider selection of items.",5
lunch here was the best!,5
"horrible food, horrible place, horrible service. very low quality food. the food arrived 1 min after we ordered it, it looked bad and the taste was even worst than it looked. we didn't eat, we paid and we left straight away",1
"not all staff are very fluent in english, food was decent but nothing special",3
"excellent food and service for reasonable prices. food is malaysian/indonesian and singaporean, can be quite spicy and very flavoursome. not a chinese restaurant but one of the better chinatown restaurants.",5
nice drinks and food. recommend to book a table beforehand.,4
it may look small from the outside but it's wonderfully spacious and decorated inside. there is a lovely koi pond and bridge by the entrance. normally very busy but can get seating. dumplings are very good and the sweet and sour is excellent. the noodles are average. rather pricey at about 50 for two people.,4
"their fruit teas are great, tried sugar cane and felt disappointed, just tasted like water with sugar. the queues are really long, we walked past a few times but it was just getting longer. and they dont have many menus, you have so many people standing there obviously youd need more? and the worker was very confusing too.",3
nothing amazing about this place.,4
"really impressed with this bar. we came here for a cocktail masterclass and valerio was really fun and knowledgeable. as a tee-total, he didn't make me feel awkward - he created delicious concoctions for me and my alcohol-consuming friends. the dim sum was also surprisingly good. i will definitely return.",5

cheap and cheerful while being the best sushi,5
an all you can eat buffet and a good selection of items.,4
"horrendous service and extremely rude staff. they have no vegan options, and if even if you are exceptionally nice they will serve you nothing but a $10 side dish with a few pieces of tofu and onions. felt extremely disrespected. do not go to this restaurant.",1
the fried veggies are nice. the batter on the fried chicken dishes is crunchy but i find the seasoning too sweet in general.,3
great asian food shopping,4

"delicious, hot, and perfectly spiced. i am perpetually on a quest for the best bao--an honorable journey of eating my way through three continents of meats and sweets in bun form. bun house is up there. they have my stomach, heart, and loyalty as the bao-bassadors of london.",5

"we ordered from the a la carte menu. wasnt impressed with the fried chicken, batter was awful. the beef ribs was pricey for a few slices. overall just average compared to other places ive been too. we were given the bill straight after they cleared the table, so basically wanted us out....",2

very decent dim sum at good prices served efficiently,3
"great selection of beers from the continent, friendly and knowledgeable staff. can get a little busy, but we'll worth a visit.",4
awesome authentic japanese food in a great location,5

"excellent customer service by kobi, who patiently took the time to help me decide on what to order with a really positive attitude",5
brownie ice cream sandwich with a scoop of coconut matcha - the brownies were really good but the coconut ice cream was ok. it's pricy and by the time we went there (around 3 oclock) the special ice cream sandwiches were almost already gone.,3
"great hidden location! definitely worth a go for a smart ish end to a night. + wouldnt know it was here in central london. brilliant find+ not rowdy or loud, can still have a chat in a super atmosphere. - cocktails are not cheap. but they are pretty cool.",5

the place is quite small and there can be a queue. but the menu offering is decent ,4
"all you can eat buffet, good selection of food from fried rice, noodles, sweet n sour chicken, beef in black bean sauce and loads more. great for hungry appetites or just a quick stop for a bite to eat. for the money you pay it's good food. have visited here several times.",4
"mostly dwelled by locals, this japanese casual diner and dessert place specialized in kakigori also offers a small selection of typical japanese caf dishes (tonkotsu, curry, noodles) and a few sushi and donburi options. the overall quality is good and the staff is friendly and polite. very good value for central london as well",5

nice selection of teas,3
expensive and rushed service. food was ok but nothing out of the ordinary,3
"10% service charge added!!! also, lately, they were raided and traces of mouse droppings found in the food...generally poor customer service as well as very steep prices, hard to justify even before the spice of mice was found.",1
great night out for food,5
reasonable price and cheerful.,5
"have been here few times, always ok, last time is a downer. the lady at the bar was rude, the drinks were not served for a long time (and she brought them from another bar in the venue, although we were sitting at the bar she was in), music is very so so.",2
2 years i had to wait to come to london and finally got back to this great restaurant.,5
they make some really cute looking snacks from sure,5
decent food at reasonable prices. dumplings were of an ok quality,3
horrible food i guess you get what you pay for but the food is tasteless.. very chewy and under cooked. avoid your better of  putting on the extra money to go else where. better still go mcds.and you have to pay 10 percent service charge for serving your self?!the lemonade was flat as if it was out of a opened bottle.  avoid .,1

excellent service and the food is very good!,5
"very busy little restaurant.  good value food, but nothing fancy.  cash only",3
unassuming malaysian dishes in a cheap yet cosy setting. the carrot cake stir fry is a must. avoid the satay.,4
best korean bbq restaurant in london for me. you should better booked before due to crowned costumer and long line after 6pm. for price is quite expensive but compares to quality it's reasonable. recommende,5
"visit this buffet on sunday. wanted to try this place for a long time. a fairly large selection of food, which unfortunately tastes horrible. everything has a taste of cheap sunflower oil. i was feeling sick all evening.",1
small place with excellent food. bit steep for a beer but food itself is well priced. beef rendang was amazing and they made a seafood-less laksa for us because allergies weren't the issue. roti canai was a beautiful taste of being back in india/malaysia! i will be back.,5
"been to this place about 3/4 times. every time the food has been delicious, and the service is prompt. the menu is very long, i could go every day of the year and end up with a different dish!the dimsum in particular is really good. will definitely revisit. no need to reserve as there is usually lots of space.",5

marvelous lobster chinese style.,4
"went in to take out 2 slices of cake florin adrian served us and picked the cake slices up with his hand, yes they have plastic on the side but i didn't want cake with florin's thumb indentation. don't be lazy give a proper service and use the equipment provided!!",1

"nice surprise. good food, quick service and much larger inside than it appears.",4
the cleanest chinese restaurant! plates and cutlery so clean. also staff proper dressed and tidy. food was also very tasty good value for the money. i have been looking for a long time for a clean rest in china town and i really recommend  this one. thank you!,5
love coming here!! cocktails are great and it's the perfect place for a chilled out drink away from the tourists in chinatown. you don't need to book but you do have to answer the door staffs questioning with a bit of confidence! ,5
always the best place to get pork belly. all the food is fresh and amazing. don't be caught out by the enforced service charge though.,5
"food was tastey, but service was poor, never got all our dishes and they tried to charge for them. so check your bill!",1
incredible!,5
loads of chinese products at reasonable prices,4
great location and attentive staff.really nice menu.,5
"the hot pot was generous and good, even if i'd been surprised that the food arrived still frozen... and it was quite pricey : a bit more than 28 pounds per person, when you include the service charge. anyway, it was a nice experience.",4

it wasnt my favorite food-wise but it accommodated us (group of 6) without a reservation on a busy evening.,3
had a set menu for 3.....good stuff...but could be a bit salty if not taken with rice or noodles...roasted meats were good,4
"tried their chatime x sanrio tiramisu milk tea. it was very sweet - since i opted for regular sugar (which was a mistake i made on my behalf) - but nevertheless, it felt like i was actually eating the dessert. would love to come back and try their other flavoured drink from the collab series.",4
"decent enough vietnamese spot, if not a little uninspired, which serves the usual fare, e.g. pho, noodle bowls etc. had a lunch menu which at 9.50 for two courses represented good value for money. i've had better elsewhere in the city but it's certainly worth a visit if you're in the area. service was friendly and attentive.",4
very modern looking chinese restaurant in the heart of china town. a little dark inside but nice atmosphere. their crispy duck with pancakes is delicious and their plum sauce is the best. reasonably priced for london. friendly and very helpful staff. will definitely come again.,4
"excellent choices of dim sum, a whole booklet and also a season menu of dim sum. it was fresh and also very tasty.update 01/01/2020service is getting better. highly impressed by the quick, patient and attentive service.",5
"the service is bad, the food is bad as well, if you really want to taste taiwanese food, you should not come here.",1
food is great and price. quick turn over.,4
all about dim sums! the best part? the price. ,4
"the food was mediocre at best. the chicken with chili and black beans had no taste whatever, the  spicy pork strips were thickly coated in flour and deep fried western style till it became hard and chewy. the peking duck came with pulled duck that looked and tasted like it was yesterdays leftover and the service was abyssmal....",1
"great food, good service. almost needed to be rolled out of there i was so full",4
"money-making machine with very little attention to customers. small portions. true, some undeniable creativity and know-how, but london has much more to offer. will not come back.",2
"nice enough pub, good selection of beer. quite expensive but expected for a central london pub",4
great cocktail bar. never tried the food so couldn't speak to that but really love the 2nd floor bar area. spent one evening with friends drinking through the chinese zodiac. so much fun!,4
absolutely amazing. great veggie dishes,5
fantastic food at a price that i was surprised at the quality of the service and the meal far eceeded ecpepeetations the staff was very friendly and helpful nothing was to much trouble,5
wonderful food. not busy at all and very clean and comfortable.,5
if i could i will give 0 stars the worst experience ever staff was horrible !!! in my opinion they need training on customer service,1
can't beat a classic milk tea! service is very friendly.,5
"the first time i went i had a jam doughnut which was good. the second time i got a nutella doughnut, which was very dense and dry, and a snicki minaj which had better dough but was way too sweet.",2
"rude people, kept laughing talking chinese and i clearly dont understand. always on their phones clearly dont care about the customers or their business. over priced too. would not recommend!! other bubble tea places are 100% better, cheaper and tastier. avoid!!",1
my favorite dumpling place in london!,5
great service and delicious tapioca pearls,5
restaurante tailands bem localizado e com tima relao custo benefcio,4
such a great club! had so much fun! the music is just awesome!,5
okay. kind of a bit like home cooked thai,3
just order the pho. others not as good as it seems. spring rolls is horrible.,3
food is good and so is price but they need more than 2 toilets that are tiny cubicles for a massive restrant. can't even imagine what it's like during theatre time :0,4
vegan doughnuts. yum!!! awesome  selection loved eating these krispy who?,5
very cozy ,4
"the food is okay - good price for the portion. staff are polite and friendly. the downfall is that the restaurant is pretty dirty: floor, dust on sides, dirty walls. note: you can only pay by cash, and they add a 12% service charge however, you can ask the staff to remove it.",3
the food made me fart so hard. chocked.,3
just the best food and service..worth going up the stairs,5
come to sit and watch the street life out the window. beer selection fine but not too exciting,4
good for a quick bite,3
is a fantastic place. music and board games,5
i had a mango drink of some kind and it was great,4
"bar legal, porem bebidas muito mais caras que o normal! ento no  to acessvel.",3
"a fantastic new take on the old cafe de paris. the disco54 launch was one of the best nights i've had in london in so long, bringing together the best of immersive performance and great music. can't wait to get back under the discoball.",5
something different in the heart of china town.not the cheapest place for a night out but worth every penny.,4
i have had much better burgers. i ordered the southern fried chicken burger which was processed chicken and quite soggy on the inside. the bun was not good quality and was in pieces at the bottom and just a handful of chips.the coco zero was almost flat.not worth the money in my opinion.,1
"fantastic quality and great price.highlights for me are the custard bun and mantau which are as good as i've had in taiwan. bo lo yao bao was unfortunately a bit poor so avoid that but everything else on the menu is excellent.if you were umming and ahhing about the trip, just get it. also fantastic.",5
nice chinese food ....cheap price....may not have the best ambient but still good if you are hungry,4
"food was ok, as well as the service. nothing special. the majorly negative thing was that nobody has warned us in advance that they dont accept contactless payment, so we couldnt pay with apple pay. this is not acceptable in the modern world, where you can pay with apple pay wherever you want.",2
the foods were tasty especially the seafood hofan.  it was delicious.  all those sims dishes were good too. do not know what reason i have diarrhoea all night long.,3
great place for dim sum in chinatown,5

this place has been a regular haunt for me for at least ten years! the food is always delicious and the staff are great. good value too. ,5
"locate centre of china town. busy place, but service is quick at the start of our meal. food tasted good and price is reasonable. ambience is good. but the bill took a while, i have to stand in front of the counter to get my bill, so have to take one star off. i'm sure it will get better though so hopefully i can rate 5-star next time.",4
lovely street in the heart of the city that never sleeps.,5
worst service ever !!!! dont go there please. even drunk its a joke. discusting,1
"very very long queue, till operators are very unhelpful. no customer concern at all. really bad. the worst chinese supermarket in china town, london.i will not go back to loon fung in china town branch again. the other loon fung branches are okay.visited on thu 26/4 6pm. really bad experience. bad management.",1
"great authentic sichuan food and portion, fair prices, would definitely love to go back!",4

incredible food. a bit pricier and more refined than your normal chinatown place but definitely worth it!,5
a very dark uninteresting restaurant situated in the soho. food was boring & everything had the same taste.,2

the best chinese in london,5

"most other places were closed at 11pm sunday this wasn't. we ordered set meal b for 2 it was truly excellent. bill arrived front sheet of bill was just a  figure, 2nd sheet itemised the bill and it was 10% less, so my message is, enjoy your meal but check your bill",4
delicious! good range of flavours and combinations.,5
"a small all you can eat buffet. nothing fancy or gourmet, but well made mild average chinese food. price is comparatively low (7.95 gbp pp during the lunch plus 0.5 gbp tea and 1.5 gbp drinks), the place is well maintained, but it can be crowded during the lunch time.",4
nice macarons and great ice cream,5
nice hotpot ! there is also buffet for those who are hot pot fan. the price is reachable ! the only problem i have is the bowl and the plate is too small,4

awesome atmosphere,5
awesome burgers. the veggie one is excellent.,5
"food really nice, noodles and rice is nice sweet-and-sour chicken is okay needs a bigger building.",5
"amazing dessert. there is a queue always, but it doesn't take too long. you can also create your own and it is very filling.",5
"small, quiet place with a nice ambiance. the food is quite expensive and they tack on a service charge which is wholly unnecessary but the food is delicious. the fried chicken especially is insanely good and the yangnyeom chicken even more insane and well worth the price.",4
great dim sum and excellent roast meat. the noodle is tangy to the bite ( perfectly al dante). however the the skin of the wonton noodle soup is thick to the bite.,4
"the stone pot dishes taste better than roasted meat dishes and seafood, friendly service, sometimes waiters give too much advice which makes the customers feel like they are being pushed to order more dishes.",3

great food at great prices and in london.,5
just been there. ordered a thai curry via voucher which was delicious. the staff was also nice and caring. i was even offered a bag for takeway (recyclable) by the manager (blond girl) but i told them i could do without. great quick dinner.,5
"prices are reasonable, great food",5
a cut above on quality.,5
amazing fresh food! the girls were very lovely and respectful. best salmon i've eaten in my life. try the rolls. ,4
famous for roast duck. the staffs won't be polite because mostly mainland china students working there and they have no clue the word polite.,3
"bought the king, very tasty, however wouldn't let me order a combo and it had a big bone in it...",4
lovely place lovely price,5
just simply awesome,5

my go-to for pho place.,5
"absolutely fantastic very reasonably priced food. huge menu. lots of choice. beef rendang, laksa are both amazing :)",5
never coming back here again. nuff said. ,1

"the place to get the elixir of life, fruli",5
would recommend good tea,5
massive pub that has a cosy feel. an underground treehouse.,5

"every dish was fresh and flavorful! don't expect quick service, though, it's definitely worth the wait.",5
"fantastic authentic malaysian food at the heart of soho. you may have to queue, but it's worth it.",5
nice food! the service was a bit poor. great cocktails.,4
good pub with plenty of seats. music not too intrusive. good place to meet and talk,5
the (singapore) laksa here is top notch and extremely good value. the bowl that it comes out in is huge and has plenty of toppings. taste is super authentic and definitely one of the best i've had in london!highly recommended!,5
"used to be more quiet than it is now, good hidden place to go to impress if you're on a date",4
"huge pub, and with all the different floors easy to even get lost in. very cool-looking place, but unfortunately on a busy night tends to be way too full and the music is extremely loud. kind of takes away all the fun. should probably try when it's a bit quieter and you can actually move around to explore all the hidden corners.",3
worst chinese resturant i've been on. the food was disgusting....,1
"very authentic , friendly staff, great food, decent price! defiantly can't go wrong here. i will be coming back.",5
good food. live dumpling station is interesting.,4
im vietnamese and i did enjoyed food here. the pho broth was so delicious. i also recommend papaya and beef jerky salad. remember to bring cash as you are not allowed to pay by card if your meal costs less than 10/person.,4
consistently delicious bubble tea with a huge amount of choice. line is always long but it's definitely worth it. my favourite bubble tea place in the uk.,5
such authentic and tasty taiwanese food! love the old world charm of the interiors. vegetarian options are great too!,4
cheap and good for a quick bite. can recommend getting katsu curry or rice dishes as the dish is massive. can't recommend the usual noodles as it looks and tastes rather cheap and poorly made without much ingredients. the sushi is nice but again looks often rushed.,3
reasonable price. the waiter serving us wasn't having it! :) go with very little expectation. food is good,4
"cool. we got a selection of meats, fish and vegatables and then it's pretty much diy from then on. so i guess i'm a great chef.",4

great food. not so great service. they forgot the rice and soft drinks were flat.,4
"small, intimate place to enjoy middle eastern food served tapas style. food is authentic, fresh and tasty. bread and pittas are delicious as too are the seafood dishes. recommend early booking.",4
"disappointed, staff were not as welcoming as i had hoped",2
ordered the shaved ice fruit bowl which was delicious and also ordered the peach crepe however it looked like it was made many hours before serving as it just didn't taste fresh nor the crepe itself hot. highly disappointed.,3
"not fresh, very average food.",2
no frills. great price. recommend having one hour.,5
amazing! love the purple yam icecream!,5
