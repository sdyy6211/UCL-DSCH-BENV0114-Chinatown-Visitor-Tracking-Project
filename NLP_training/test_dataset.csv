"the most expensive tea ive ever had. we got a small cup of hot green tea for 2.50 and a small cup of hot hoji tea for 2.95, should be pot or refillable. so disappointed! feeling rip off. however, we had matcha bingsu and mango bingsu, both were nice.",2
the worst chinese restaurant i've been in london. the service attitude was terrifically terrible. the people there do not care about guest's reasonable requirement but even insult them.,1
excellent dim sum. very friendly service. arrive early on the weekend to avoid waiting for a table. restaurant is spread across 4 floors of the building so prepare to climb stairs to your table. the menu contains good pictures of the dim sum and order on the chinese style numbered order slip.,5
"dim sum was good. expensive charges for the tea, when i found out that the tea as diluted from concentrate.",3
didn't win,1
great food. lovely atmosphere. absolutely must reserve as seating is limited and they are very popular,4
lse fried rice ftw,4
good service & value for money.,5
same as every other. slow service and bad loos! drinks are fine,3
"the buffer has plenty of options for vegetarians and mest eaters alike. i really liked the chili potatoes, vegetable curry, as well as the broccoli and deep fried options. no fake meats - which is a plus. the vegetable soup tasted really good; however, the sweet and sour option tasted a bit too fake.",4
very slow service. took me one hour to get my food!,1
"nice place, live music upstairs most nights",5
the staff is really unfriendly. the service was horrible. it is the kind of place where the service you get depends of the client face... i do not recommend this place at all.,1
"great atmosphere, music and drinks!!!",5
used to pack more flavour. burgers now have to be fully cooked to satisfy the local authority.,2
has the best asian dried fish anywhere,4
good place to go out. expensive but nice.,4
"brilliant evening at this middle eastern gem. lovely wine from lebanon, some of the best baba ganoush ive ever had, pork belly was delish. 6 dishes to share, more than enough. put our names down at 6:45 and got our table at 8:20 - had a cocktail next door. friendly waitress. nice vibe.",5
"leon is marketed as ""healthy"" fast food, although to my disappointment ordering basic chicken with rice and salad, i got a cardboard box with moderate serving of chicken and rice, covered in oil, and salad with mayo + ketchup sauce. but sure if you are looking for healthier option than mcdonald's, leon may be your choice",2
"its a great place, really good food and service and karaoke rooms.",5
nice pub,5
extremely rude and racist staff. tried to kick us out early by claiming they were closing soon when they weren't. they dumped our food on the table. highly upsetting and not expected in london.,1
the absolute best place for bubble tea in all of chinatown. quick and very helpsome and friendly staff.,5
"first time trying chinese style lobster noodles  looks awesome  but actually not much lobster meat and noodles  the style is a bit unusual and weird for me, maybe i'm too used to the way they cook lobsters at burger & lobster ",3
"great ,fast,  good portions",5
"we left after waiting for our food for an hour and 15 minutes, ruined our lunar new year",1
"limited menu but almost all taste good, especially fruit tea.",4
"the donuts look way better than they actually taste, dry and stale. a low average donut with fancy decorations on top. no idea why people queuing for this. totally overrated and pricey.",2
lovely cocktail and my guest absolutely loved this place.  friendly clientele.,5
"food was average, the service appalling... very rude. waiter literally complained that we didn't finish all of our food and it was a waste... thanks, but we paid for it. then stripped the table before we'd even stood up to leave.",1
"tried the sweet moon cake today, surprisingly good. going to buy some savory ones next week.",4
amaz ing food ..,4
extremely busy but great atmosphere and decent cocktails,5
favourite place to eat for malaysian-chinese!,5
"very good pub, and good service",4
live music,4
"the atmosphere, the location... great fun, loads of food from inexpensive and up. advisably to visit on a dry day. very close to other worthwhile areas to visit.",4
their fried chicken is perfect!,5
good beer good food and good atmosphere,5
the food was absolutely lovely and the customer service was really nice and the staff were very polite,5
"we went there on wednesday night, it's now sunday morning and i'm only just getting over the worst side effects of the worst food poisoning i've ever had - good meal, but worth 72 hours of spewing, don't think so! the doctor told me it was from eating reheated undercooked/improperly stored rice. might have put me off chinese forever... ",1
"amazing, food is of high quality. recommend to reserve. i always go for the tiger prawn burger and sweet potato fries. usually costs around 20 per head with a drink.",5
i am extremely upset that london has better hot pot than san francisco.,5
fast was to lose money - why not just give it to a homeless person.,5
"the name says it all, if u love china u will love this street",5
"food was lovely, toilets not so good",3
our familys go to resto in chinatown. tasty food and although the prices are a bit high its what you would expect for such a busy area.,4
"perfect irish pub in the heart of central london. big space, great beer and whiskey selections.",5
"really nice ice cream and the taiyaki was the most surprising thing was really crispy and well done. prices are decent for what you get. lots of other cakes and treats in the store as well, the matcha muffin is really soft and fluffy.",4
busy little place.  service can be a bit slow due to being busy ,3
"i just love china town,the atmosphere is really buzzing in the evenings and on chinese new year they even have the chinese dragon out, the restaurants are nice but just look before you go in and eat.not all the eating places are good but a few are.",5
lively bar selling good range of dutch beers and craft ales.,5
great  little  restaurant. right  in the  heart  of  china  town . the  fish  is one  of  the  best  i've had.  highly  recommended.,5
food was amazing and staff very friendly,4
very good food and all you can eat,5
"wow,my wife is happy,see you next time.",5
absolutely awful response to our daughter's allergy.  waited until after sending tea order before listening that we had a nut allergy.  refused to serve her and then charged 8 for the unconsumed tea.  we were embarrassed and forced to leave.  never seen that before.  how mortifying!,1
by far the best experience for my first boba tea,5
"so tasty! i fell in love with ube after this very messy but delicious milk bun filled with the smoothest ube ice cream! love it, been back twice already",5
the christmas card is the same as the usual but with 2.5x inflated prices. food wasnt good or traditional. rice looked microwaved. 10 pounds for a small cup of rice as an example and no service. they say no service charge and add it anyway in the end.,1
cute staffs and tasty bings.,5
grear bubble tea! quite a long wait though ... usually busy.,4
beatiful,5
"been here twice now and love it! had the most delicious veggie burger!! will definitely be back for more! very cool vibe with nice decor, cool music, lovely cocktails so great place for a date. toilet seat upstairs was heated which was a cool experience! love it!",5
horrible staff,1
i loved my dish. staff are ok. no the happiest people in the world but they moved us to a nicer table before getting out food. food was very good,4
love this place for fresh hand made dumplings. the other dishes on the menu are also well worth a try like fire cracker chicken and smoked shredded chicken!,5
"quick service and delicious ube ice cream dessert. we went at a fairly quiet time, so it wasn't crowded with people, which made it a nice, quaint place to chill at.",5
"great dim sum, nice decoration, elegant place with attentive and friendly staff and also quite pricey",4
"food was nice enough, one of the waitresses was very rude and shouted at us for taking too long to order as they ""needed the table back"" we took 20 mins as were waiting for someone and ordered appetizers in that time. seemed unreasonable. shame she ruined it really.",3
good place for asian foodstuff. prices are not too pricey too,4
very tasty. nice experience to eat in chinatown.,4
1 star is too much. bland food and incredibly rude staff. being barked at by the lady up on her pedestal looking after the till and waitresses pushing children out of the way. horrible way to end a great day in london.,1
"they make everything on the premises, including fresh ho fun, glutinous rice rolls, cheung fun, radish cake, various buns and other dim sum food. prices are cheap, quality is very good and unbeatably fresh.so, if you like to cook chinese food and looking for fresh ingredients then this place has got to be on your shopping list!",5
"superb food, authentic as far as i can tell. very friendly atmosphere. slightly small dining areas but added to the cosy feeling. and any negatives massively outweighed by the incredible tastes and textures. we all loved it!!",5
great offer,4
"my worst meal in china town, truly awful. greasy, everything covered in sweet sauces. not refined chinese cuisine at all and not up to the usual standard in chinatown.",2
"really bad quality service. go in and out. they dispatch costumers. you can eat in peace. can't enjoy the food. if you go in group of 3 or more people they love you. if you are 2 or 1, you need wait out for 10 to 15 minutes until they tell you to come in winter.  in the moment than you finish they give you the bill to tell you good bye.",1
i go here when im in london and want fast chinese food as close to hk standard as possible,5
lots of fish ;),5
nice food but very cramped inside,4
great selection of buns. quick and tasty. definitely going again.,5
best of everything,5
"just a small chinatown, but have many nice foods there (eg.)",4
as always wonderful....,5
love these custard cream filled fish shaped cakes from here. cooked fresh and warm. 4 for 2 which is a bit pricy. but they're a nice little novelty to try.,4
a bit slow in serving you but the food was good,3
"food was okay,place looking good,  but our waitress was rude. ",4
good food good price,5
ridiculous expensive drinks,1
"very good food, nice atmospher, food can sometimes take longer than expected to arrive",4
"absolutely delicious as always. i totally recommend the veg bun and glass noodle salad. plus, the takeaway containers are so cute!",5
the food is amazing,5
"lot of nice asian desert, quiet place, good for meeting friends and talking.",4
"great burgers! super fresh from shake shack. this place is open until 3am, go to after a night out & it's the perfect meal to sober up! just keep in mind it will be busy because of being in central london",4
"great food for a great price. why do on earth do people go to macdonalds around the corner, it does not make sense",5
nice casino but not very big,4
dim sum here is exquisite.an absolute must.viva la dim sum cart!,5
decent service and food. not sure its value for money. they have a karaoke area downstairs that can be hired which is good fun after a dinner meal.,3
"amazing vibes, friendly sexy stuff, multi ethnic crowd of various ages and delicious cocktails on the top floor. ku has something to offer something for everybody.",5
"very low food and service quality, staff wasnt helpful. they accept only cash payments god knows why!! stay away from this place if you wanna enjoy your food.",1
the team at this location are the friendliest bunch  very quick service with a smile. rare to find that in central london!,5
unbelievably brilliant dessert concept. where's this been all my life?,5
i always choose here to eat dim sum as i know it's the best for it and reasonably priced for london chinatown,4
"always a nice atmosphere, the place is beautiful!",5
"tasty, healthy, and quick food. really nice staff. chill atmosphere. would definitely recommend",5
service ok. food mediocre.  not cheap.  much better options around here.,2
dont even deserve a star.,1
"the service is very bad, the lady that was serving us for dinner look like she was mad the whole time. the food is average but lacked flavor.",2
"best kbbq i've had so far. everything fresh, tasty and .. just perfect. lovely interior, i'd like to eat there every day :')",5
nice place with friendly and extremely ripped bartenders.,4
"i love coming to see fiza and her amazing team every time for excellent professionalism, service and most importantly for a fab job on my nails. the team have always taken great care of me and definitely take the time and precision to ensure my nails are always perfect !",5
been to most dim sum places around china town and this is the best.  you may pay a bit more but you get that back in quality of food and a nice restaurant setting. clean toilets and staff are reasonably friendly and efficient. ,4
really nice japanese desert solve there but a bit expensive. i would not mind to go back from time to time.,4
great food:) very unique!,5
it was utterly disgusting. the amount of salt poured into every dish can raise your blood pressure easily by a hundred. every dish is an abomination conjured to rip your taste buds out of your tongue. proceed to eat at your own risk.,1
fun,5
rude doors staff. tasty cocktails,3
"food was actually very tasty, however order was wrong and drinks didn't arrive. they are very busy and language obviously plays a part, worth going but don't expect a unique customer experience. as i said, the food was actually pretty good",3
"this is a perfect spot in chinatown for wonton soup and dumplings (fried, steamed, vegetarian, duck). i normally don't go for the other options because i just love the soup. they do a nice pearl tea if that's your thing.",5
great vibe and 241 cocktails after 4pm! not too many tables though so get in early!,4
food pretty good but quickly in and quickly leave- a bit hecti. warning- some items such as tsingtao beer are not priced on menu . check your bill (and prices) in this restaurant please! items on the bill are listed but only the total is written on the back of the bill.,3
this has got to be one of the trashiest restaurant i have ever been to in my life!,1
good meal with a variety of food in the buffet.  very friendly service and a reasonable price.,4
wonderful. been going here for two generations now. brought two birthday cakes.,5
great selection of asian groceries and snacks!,4
"my girlfriend and i tried the ""all you can eat"" hotpot here. the service and the food are amazing. the waiters are friendly and kept reminding us when their kitchen was going to close, and they were very efficient. the meat and seafood were fresh and good. highly recommended.",5
the staffs are friendly and the food are nice!,5
extremely bad service especially for mainland chinese people. it is the worst choice if you d like to eat out in chinatown unless you enjoy being discriminated.,1
nice service and good food for asians.,4
awesome staff and service. will recommend if you are craving for an all-you-eat buffet.,5
"great food with friendly staff, you know it a good restaurant when it queued out the door.",5
has alot of different asian food that you cant find in normal shops....well worth a visit if you into diff foods.,4
"good value, straightforward japanese food",4
delicious no nonsense food... lovely staff however busy it might be.,5
love this place! so many delicious belgian fruit beers to try. and great food too :) try the kip sate,5
nice food and very quite atmosphere,4
nice authentic dim sum. go there before 5pm for the lunch time offer.,4
good for fast food.,3
excellent food quality and tastes. very authentic chinese with typical chinatown style of services. no ambience so just come here for good chinese foods. always busy and reservation is taken here.,4
great pub very friendly staff slightly quirky we loved it.,5
need to improve on the vegetables fruits a lot of time it's not fresh and  self check out tills keep going wrong.,3
without flavor,1
the burlesque show is definitely not for men. they make straight men do gay stuff on stage!,1
"mediocre food, relentless music, piorly coordinated",1
super cheap fun and authentic buns!! you pick what buns you want at the counter (i highly recommend the custard buns!) and they stamp them all so you know what they are. take them upstairs to eat with some complimentary sriracha and you're set!,5
"the cakes in the window drew us to this cafe. the ambiance and interior are really nice. the menu is varied. the cakes were average, quite ok but not exceptional. we were informed that the danish pastry is fresh from the morning but might suffer now in late afternoon. that was fair information.",4
must visit at night to get the full visual experience!,5
their taiyaki is the best i've ever tasted.,5
great thai restaurant in london. fresh and quality. will come back to try the other food soon.,5
nice one super hotel,5
the best food i have had for some time now. very authentic thai taste and a reminder of the thai street food we ate. we were recommended by friends and it was the best! thankful..,5
just terrible. don't even want to give a star.,1
a nice place... and good food.,5
nice building. food is ok. but its very expensive for food and drink. was 150 for 4 people and still very hungry when leaving. much better value places in the area.,2
definitely seen beter.  curries were nice. service was so-so!,3
delish! the halo halo is superb!,4
"great menu, but service needs to be improved. we were left waiting for a long time between courses.",3
never been,1
"poor food, little choice, very oily, worst wings, worst chow meing, worst duck. food was very bland, very disappointed. staff rushed us to eat, very little hospitality. did not feel comfortable at all. you dont have to listen to me but if i were you i would spend my money at a restaurant elsewhere.",1
"only because the bar staff are really rude at closing time, giving you one minute to leave before they start mouthing off.",1
rude staff members and very slow in making drinks,1
"really great selection of chinese pastries! it seems to be popular because it was crowded the whole time i was there. everything was so good, i would definitely come back here again!",5
very unpleasant staff that complains about you or other customers assuming you don't understand chinese. very rude.,1
"this buzzy, funky japanese spot with a retro vibe features wagyu burgers and inventive cocktails.",5
"there are only two words to describe this dive - grim and avoid.situated on the doorstep of some of the finest chinese food in the country, mw buffet (or mr wu's) is a national disgrace. the terrible food is only topped by the 10% service charge - levied in a restaurant where you load your own plate and serve yourself.what a joke.",1
tasty atmosphere and good music!,5
great selection.,5
been here three times now. food is always amazing. its very cozy and welcoming. definitely worth a try,5
great vibe and brilliant mixologists!,5
not as good as it usually is but worth the 10.95,3
fantastic job doing my daughter's nails...i ended up getting pedicure too and super creative nail design!,5
"the staff are polite, but service is slower than  you would expect when it is not busy. they show premier league, which is the main reason i go there. i recommend this place",4
staff is not very friendly. i would suggest another bar.,1
"great food, but eat pay and leave.",4
epic buns at reasonable prices. convenient central location - ideal to stop off for a snack while exploring soho.,4
"great food, great service. perfect for groups and really reasonably priced. can't fault them",5
authentic chinese food! great taste and good service. we tried the pepper and pork soup () and the taste is rich for it is with good ingredients and control of time for cooking! the chef did it right,5
i love the food here. it is so fresh and the service is excellent as well.a very varied menu with something for everyonegreat pricesvery clean as wellrecommended,5
amazing cabaret show and party afterwards. would highly recommend,5
amazing! it's delicious. i'd definitely come again!,5
i went there and tried the taiyaki ice cream : a wonder. it was delicious and quite cheap. a nice afternoon snack,5
the quality of the hamburger was far away from the expected. it was clear that the number of people working was lesser than necessary for the area's demand.,1
"great burger joint. love going to shake shack. fantastic location and easily accessible. lots of seating and attentive staff. mixed experiences, the burger is always fantastic however the chips were served luke-warm.",4
very delicious chinese food,5
"standard chinatown grocery store with pretty much all you need. till system a little slow, which meant queuing in the food isles for around 10 mins. ",3
if you like macaroons this is the place to go!about 5 different flavours to choose from and you can make your own. each one is roughly 4.50 which i thought was reasonable. it's filling and yummy. it's only a small place and so there is limited stock. i went on a sunday at around 4pm and there wasn't much left to choose from.,4
"superb food, good portion size. would happily go again. i can recommend the sweet and sour prawns.",5
"if a bustling bar & standing shoulder to shoulder & getting your drinks knocked over isn't your thing, this might just be the place for you, to have a quiet moment with your lady & enjoy her company over a good glass of wine. ",4
"this place look really cute, but the food is too disappointing. they mixed japanese food + western style, and its not very nice , i was expecting a good japanese foods cuz i been to japan , but no , very disappointed",2
"atmosphere was nice, like a speakeasy. vegetarian dim sum was good. zodiac cocktails were excellent! only reason it didnt get full stars was because it was really uncomfortable to eat because of the low table, more like a coffee table.",4
loved it... great food.  this is a nice little restaurant with more seating downstairs.  i would definitely recommend the food here. the vietnamese coffee is nice and sweet and gives you the boost required.  worth a visit.,5
pricey and service bad,3
if you love doughnuts then this is the place to go. forget the pretenders (krispy kreme) as doughnut time is thy king or queen to the sweet treat you can't wait to eat throne.,5
food was really nice. had the set meal c was good value for money a lot of food for the price. waiters were quick. wait wasn't long. only thing to moan about was it was quiet cold inside and the tables were small for 4 people.,5
probably the best crossover restaurant ever,5
best bubble tea in london! i would recommend the caramel milk tea with taro bubbles.,5
"simply the best authentic chinese food i have ever had. a lot of the dishes were unfamiliar to me but the waitress helped me pick a really tasty selection. i was worried about the chilli content but it was always perfectly balanced in every plate of food. cash only, and not a big enough space for really large groups.",5
"the best bubble tea in china town .should try tiramlsu milk tea !friendly staff especially ""dondon""",5
it was very nice place. i can say the tastes are equivalent to what we have in malaysia/singapore. its just that the gravy was not spicy. everything else are superb.standard breakfast set for the local malaysian. nasi lemak + teh tarik. awesome!,5
i ordered a bowl of need noodles soup and it was not bad.,4
get the dynamite shrimp they are unreal! also the toilets are very fun to mess around with,4
"beautiful venue, recently enjoyed the west end musical brunch with a bunch of my girlfriends and it was absolutely fantastic!!!! great food, great entertainment & lovely cocktails! big thank you to the host tom he was amazing!",5
"staff were rude, the system they use to communicate with other staff gives the impression they are not listening to the customers.  this was confirmed when one of the dishes we ordered did not arrive and we had to reorder.",2
very nice korean/japanese cafe! loved the special dish korean spicy chicken,5
even though the restaurant emphasise that no msg was added for the pho. but i personally think the flavour is not rich enough. but the beef is really good. full of flavour and tender.,4
one of the best places in south london for sushi.,5
"intimate and well formed, this place serves up a great tea ceremony with a mix of savory and sweet dim sums. ask your waiter/waitress for tea recommendations.",5
queued for 45 minutes on one occasion and no wait on another. this place serves pretty decent quality bubble tea and isn't too expensive. a good alternative to chatime.,4
a different place to try,4
"great menu and quality of food, only downside is that there are no hubs above the bbqs so all your belongings will smell very intensely like bbq when you leave. not a good idea before a night out!",5
"simple japanese diner serving sushi, bento, noodles and curries.",5
"average food - have had much better in chinatown. also, waiters did not bring us anything we had asked for and waiter gave me dirty looks.i  will not go here a second time.",2
pretty good selection of european beers and dutch bar snacks with a fun atmosphere of 90s and 00s music. great place to be in central london on a weekend. can get very busy!,5
friendly staff and cozy interior,5
great selection of green vegetablesbeware kids,4
amazing. talked me through the menu because i was a waffle beginner. loved it. and very lovely staff too.,5
big queues and a bit chaotic. enjoyed my bubble tea.,4
nice large clean and bright eatery... loos right down stairs so was hard for me with a walking disability. some nice seating booth's and good service. would use again ,4
"long queues, but worth it. i ordered the milk tea hot with bubba, less sugar.. delicious!",5
"incredible melt in your mouth dim sum, try the aromatic duck in net fried dim sum. the staff speaks poor english but it is expected from such an authentic experience.",4
the best buns in town!!!,5
"good buns, good cheung fun. a lot of the buns were sold out when i went as it was an hour before close. would visit again to try their best-selling buns and custard tart",4
very good food and quick service. london prices.,5
walked past here and gave it a random try and was not disappointed. very good quality of food and dim sums for the price. would recommend for a quick nice meal. i would happily go again.,5
"great staff. excellent food. if you're adventurous, they have an all-chinese menu with real, authentic chinese dishes. ",5
food was tasty but front staff has this bad attitude (rude) comes from no where.,1
"excellent food, great quality of meal, fantastic dcor, and for a very reasonable price. a real good find, this one!",5
nice chinese!,4
nice buns with tasty fillings,4
"great burgers, but mediocre service. that's what you'd expect from a fast food outlet i suppose. location is great for those touring london. right by china town and all the action leicester square has to offer.",4
custard bun!,4
busy but efficient service not a relaxing place  but excellent menu.,4
"really different and new food, excellent service, a very special restaurant. don't bother with the menu, instead allow the charming staff a free hand in selecting a (large) choice of starters for you.  be warned that these are sufficiently filling to render a main course almost unnecessary.",5
"poor service, dirty tables and although food was ok it wasn't memorable for the price",1
"the place is ok. the crowd is on the pretentious side, music was flat, no room to move around properly or dance.",3
the milk bun was a bit sweet and doughy. ube ice cream great though.,4
good price good food in the centre of london,4
"in the 10+ years i've been going here, it never disappoints. excellent staff, great food. as authentic as you're going to get in london. it would be a crime if high rents and redevelopment ever touched this joint.",5
the staff were very helpful with advising on dietary requirements.,4
worth trying,5
the food is not as authentic / good as it used to be,3
"being a vegetarian!!!! food was amazing. not much choice but very tasty. they were very honest to say in which they had chicken broth/beef broth. service very good. if you like beer, dont forget to try hanoi beer!!!!",5
"always good service good food and good menu, but they seemed to over reach for the festive season and over priced and rushed the food resulting in a very under par service. however the atmosphere and some staff were able to make up with the service they rendered and the cheer of the season did make it a bit better",4
"lovely food, and singing too!",5
"very good service, been here for a few years. i always get my haircut by sally. very nice person, friendly, skilled and funny!",5
"the food of the nonya and baba, served in a small but sympathetic eatery in london town",4
"hand made dumplings, make sure you bring cash.",5
great service and location.,5
"casino its just amazing , but bar upstairs its making mistakes... they're selling raspberry mojito when the drink its just rum, rasp syrup and soda?? whaaaaat??? ... just quiet dissapointed with the staff bar upstairs all times im going...",3
avoid at all costs,1
"vibrant vibe. cool atmosphere , elegant and sophisticated. prices accordingly to the quality of the price, music on point, perfect place to start/finish a good night.",4
the service was excellent the food amazing one of the best chinese meals i've had,5
we have been to this restaurant three times and have been impressed each time. definitely will be back ,5
i have never given 5 stars to a fast food joints but this place has great vegetarian dishes that i would gladly eat again next time i'm in the uk.,5
good selection of asian style cakes and desserts.,4
best bubble tea!,5
"great dim sum in a down to earth setting. the ordering process is a little confusing for the uninitiated but the quality of the food made me want to return, and i have a few times!",5
great selection of food and friendly staff!,5
great value for money and feels like a proper korean restaurant. staff friendly and food fantastic. ,5
the food was just delicious. we came as a party of five and the dishes are well suited for sharing. the service was excellent. make sure you book atleast a few days in advance as it's very hard to get a table. you can also request to be added to the waiting list in case someone cancels their reservation.,5
"we drove over an hour just to come back here because it was sooo good. as we got there they closed but fizz let us in, kindly and was yet again impressed both with the customer service and the dessert! got recognised by one of the employees too which added to the experience! definitely coming back.",5
"love their food. the taste, the fact that they have a book with all the ingredients and allergenes and calories - it's fantastic! and they're all around london!",5
"some of the best ice cream i've tasted, fast efficient service and really polite staff. this stuff is strange looking but far exceeds expectation. give it a shot, i'm sure it'll surprise you. i'll definitely be going again very soon!",5
orgasmic chicken.,5
"i went with a friend to celebrate my birthday. i ordered and l had only taken a few mouthfuls of the starter. i felt hot and uncomfortable .there was no air, l fainted an ambulance was called.the restaurant staff still charged the full price although most of the food hadn't even come to the table !",1
"my sisters just bought a coffee roll cake for 5 from there. the cake was mouldy. we called and the woman on the phone was rude and said we have to come back to get a refund. coming back would mean 3 bus fare on top of the price of the mouldy cake. never purchasing from them again, avoid at all costs",1
"really good, hot, fast and clean. deep fried crab was excellent. they are very good with toddlers as naughty as ours.",5
value for money - served with attitude,4
very cute little filipino ice cream parlour in china town - with unusual flavours and servings. tried the ube and guyabano ice cream and it was delicious. will definitely return with more space in the tummy to try the other stuff. the staff was friendly and the place was jam packed! thumbs up!,5
excellent roast duck. it is better than your seasons,4
quite good chinese supermarket.,3
always a pleasure.. great food after meeting with friends,5
all food was of excellent quality,4
super expensive for what it is. the xiao long bao pastry was very hard. bbq pork buns were small and a weird texture. not impressed.,2
rude staff. super hot in there and no air con. and times open advertised not correct.,1
good bubble tea with different varieties and variations of sweetness. would go again,5
friendly staff and a great atmosphere,5
disappointed with the food and for a large restaurant to have only one toilet is not good for a family with small kids,2
great restaurant for vietnamese food. the pho was very delicious. a little bit cramped inside but the staff were excellent.,5
"food is fine, service was good.",4
delicious dishes.  attentive staff.  authentic middle eastern/mediterranean dishes definitively worth coming!,5
"best things to eat are the beijing & veggie dumplings (always get steamed), the fish ball soup and the teas. meat and rice are ok, but the steamed dumplings are the star.",4
great food and lovely service.,4
"fast service with delicious traditional meals and drinks. there is real sushi made by a sushi chef, although the wasabi is just horseradish (not an especially bad thing as real wasabi is very expensive).",5
fun place.,5
lovely chinese food,5
nice waiting stuff and delicious food. i also liked the decoration.,5
"yummy dumplings- dim sum menu was good. bit dark inside, atmosphere was a bit dull. seating area was a bit compact but the dumplings were good- love the pork and spring rolls",4
"whenever i'm at four seasons, the roasted duck is the dish that is a must have. usually ordered with other side dishes such as tofu and mixed vegetables. however, it is usually crowded and the staff are always in a hurry and busy. food is served promptly and quickly.",3
we were starving after touring the tour of london and really wanted something authentic. this place did not disappoint. i had the chicken pho and fresh spring rolls with prawns- delicious. the cocktail menu is insane and has so many fresh options. i definitely would recommend this place.,5
great public house,5
nice to drink 1 or 15 beers,5
great fresh made chinese dumplings made right there in the window.,4
"loved it , food good and hot , only down side was either red wine or white wine no wine list",5
"super soft buns and amazing taste, tried the pork and chicken. pork was amazing would suggest trying with chilli oil not to spicy but great flavour.",5
we really enjoyed the vegetarian set menu. would definitely go back again.,5
man,5
"friendly service and a good ordering system allowing you to get settled at a table ready for your food.  very tasty chicken and (mu)shroom burgers and the garlic mayo fries are excellent.  a good selection of beverages with, or course, the excellent milkshakes taking pride of place.",5
super cheap and tasty food... could not ask for more!!,5
"perfect place to take your company for a great night out. fantastic music, kind staff, and good atmosphere! highly recommended!",5
really good and cheap. they are not big plates,5
refined cuisine with a touch of glamour. decor harkens back to a bygone taiwanese era which i rate highly. teapots and teas were very fussy however and the table we were sat at was almost too small and crowded. would come back to visit the top floor if price was a little bit more reasonable for the portion sizes.,3
save your money and eat elsewhere,2
my favourite chinese store,5
the best doughnuts ever. theyre massive! (with a massive price tag) but sooo worth it. best ive ever had. there are so many vegan flavours and all sooo good,5
"amazing food, and very stylish modern decor, staff are wonderful 5 stars!!!!",5
"i had a chicken burger , and it was really nice , i will definitely come back to eat!",5
one of the best places for duck in chinatown. really really good.,5
visited this place on christmas and they triple charged/scammed us with extra service too wth. receipt was hand written too... not to say the food is good to begin with...,1
very good quality. very busy. sometimes out of some flavours. cash only.20 times the price in taiwan! ,4
"great bar, the upstairs sofa area is fab. reasonable prices for the west end. will definitely visit again",5
"tasty 'bueno mars' certainly get a lot of icing outside and filling when you're paying 4.50 per donut. second time been now and got a loyalty card when purchase 9 get 10 stamp free donut. the flavours and pun names are creative, though they don't feel like luxurious high end.",4
racist bunch.. the security guard tells that there is no space for 5 people.. then 5 people are let in right behind.. we were people of color and they werent.. do i need to say anything more at a supposedly inclusive bar..,1
"average cantonese food and value. i would stay away from sichuan food here, mostly not spicy or authentic enough. general cantonese twist, though all the dishes are a bit sweet to me. service is excellent! waitstaff are attentive and private rooms are a plus! overall, nice interiors.",3
very juicy and yummy!!! worth to wait for a while. there are seats in the first floor. it's clean and comfortable...,5
nice atmosphere giod beers.,4
i always bring my family here for their tasty shaved ice dessert. this is our go to whenever we have dinner in chinatown. i always recommend them to my friends.,5

always the first place when visit london. iced bubble tea was good. staff were nice.,5
great service and friendly staff!,5

"great food, lovely cocktails, even has options suitable for gluten free diets.",5
"delicious fried to order chicken! they have a great and simple menu with a bunch of different flavour toppings for the chicken, my favourites include their pepper and curry seasonings. they also do super yummy sweet potatoe fries.",5
great place and great crowd,4
the best chinese restaurant ive ever been in london. the waitress was really nice and the food she recommended to me was great. ill definitely return to the restaurant in a week. only thing i have to say that they just accept cash.,5
"one of my favourite restaurant in london. signature chicken and pork belly hotpot reminds me of my hometown, roast duck is our favourite. always recommend to friends who travel to london.",4
unfortunately it was closed and the restaurant gutted.,3
nice food could be bigger portions,4
"reminds me of hong kong, best dumplings in town. noodles are instant but who cares, it tastes good man.",5
totally delicious authentic food.silly not to try it!i loved the duck.,5
"a fantastic experience, try a huoguo.",5
great burgers  nice toilets that have a heated seat very small but all in all a brilliant experience.,5

nice burger with very good price. open 24h which is rare in region for this kind of offer,4
the best bakery in chinatown . i love the custard bun .,5
mega,5
the chicken is too sweet not a real taiwanese style. overpriced and overrated.,3
really nice,5
"alright fried chicken, but for 8.5 a piece i dont recommend it.(half of it shown in the picture is mostly bones.)",2
"my favourite bakery in chinatown, i love the chicken curry bun",5

"lots of great beers, and frli on tap!",5

"a tiny, packed and friendly newsagent and general store. hard to find in central london!",5
great choice for asian food,5
"great staff, polite and friendly. food was served quickly and tasted great. place was clean and up to standards",5
like seafood counter,5

macau pork dish is amazing fantastic food long waiting times to get in,5
"excellent dim sum, the noodles and rice are fantastic. just delicious food. ",5
range has improved over the years. most things can be sourced in this chinese grocery store,5

extremely yummy food and very friendly staff! really recommend the shredded duck and crispy fried shredded beef,5
"unique hidden bar in london, a bit pricey but nice if you are searching something after 12am",5
excellent dim sum. friendly attentive staff.,5
food is so good but the wine is expensive for the tiny amount given ..,4
"good quality, good service, fast. dim sum are good!",4
lovely in every aspect,5
"pricey, small  but the desserts were good. ginger milk dessert could really taste the ginger the spheres something was pleasantly not too sweet. if it was not so expensive, i would have given 4.5 stars",3
best gel manicure ive ever gotten. came twice while in london for a month. alex is amazing and i watched fiza do some awesome acrylic nail art to the people next to me. highly recommend!!!!,5
"super delicious bilog and ube brownie! brownies are only available on the weekends, definitely a must try! if you like something sweet then go for the brownie, if not the try the ube bilog! they also play good music there. try to come early as the bilog is usually sold out at 8.30.",5
nice food and good service,4
amazing pork and chef hot hot hot,5
super yummy food,5
over priced. nothing special about this place,1
i wasnt here but it kind of looks cool from above,4
really really bad not made to feel unwelcome. i am a 60 year old man. i was asked for id and searched twice infront of my family. would never go again. this was in the afternoon. security are completely over the top,1
"good food, quiet place and nice waiters. ",4
"food was okay, accepts card payments unlike other eat all you can restaurants in chinatown, 10.95 price exclusive of service charge",4
"ice cream in a donut. nuf said.exotic flavours, colours and friendly atmosphere! decent sized scoops too, makes it all the better",5
the bubble tea feels diluted. the pearls are a little too chewy,3
"nice restaurant, excellent service, delicious exotic food. if you want to discover something new try it!!",5
very good dim sums and wan ton soup,5
stuffy. shifty staff. food came  lukewarm but the dim sum was nice. be warned - they add on 10% service charge  automatically.,1
amazing little supermarket that's not so little!!!,5
very good food. friendly manager.,5
horrible place very rude staff roast duck and  char siew served cold  steamed fish we waited 30 minutes and taste awful vegetables too oily and tastes disgusting  price is reasonable for budget conscious but will not recommend this place ,1
been here 3 times so far during my london trip and i've had three different drinks all of them tasted amazing!,5
good food and good service,5
nice big portions. id recommend the laksa. standard malaysian food but nothing mind blowing.,3
"cheaper as it's off the beaten track, can get busy as expected, but great service",4
been here a few times but disappointed to see the toilets were very unclean and full of people keying up on a saturday night. also lack of staff behind the bar meant long wait to get a drink. will give it a few years.,3
"i have never visited this place but if the allegations of discriminatory or racist behaviour is anything to go by, then this must be thoroughly investigated by the appropriate authorities. this country has gone past this sort of small mindedness and racism of any sort, covert or otherwise is simply unacceptable.",1
i like this place because is something different! the burguer rolls are amazing and the prawns are something else!,4
good range of products but a bit pricey..still good at all..,5
"this casino is in a lovely refurbished theatre - smart but still retaining its character. the dealers are polite, efficient & friendly. it has a more intimate , personal feel than other casinos in london. great place to spend an evening with friends.",5
interesting choice of food tasty,5
mango bing and kinako bing. 6 each with generous portion.,5
go for the dim sum menu (no it doesn't just mean dumplings) and you will be amazed at fresh and deliciously hot the food arrives. fantastic service all round too,5
this restaurant's food was great and nothing like a chinese delivery. it was the best chinese we have ever eaten. very basic set up but friendly welcoming staff.  we will be back,5
"amazing food, for 5 you can eat a box full of delicious food, they even give you a plastic fork and a napkin! :) i regret i didn't took pictures, but it was delicious and i was hungry :p eheheh",4
very bad service the food was good when we finely got the right order. they have no heigene rating.,1
the food is extremely delicious. staff is good very presentable .. i recomend all should try this place..,5
beautiful pub very spacious. sometimes they have live music and it's really lovely. can be a little loud sometimes which i like but it's really down to preference. good food aswell.,5
"nice teas. nice fresh orange juice and charming staff. unfortunately ma ""croque monsieur"" was terrible. they should take it off the menu really. salad that was accompanying it was something to be ashamed of. not sure i would get back at concerto, if i would i probably try a pastry. they looked lovely",3
"crispy batter, juicy and flavourful fried chicken! :) only downside is the limited space and seating.",4
very cool asian gate entrance. lots of great restaurants and stores in narrow streets.,5
"food was exceptional, minimal complaints about the service. i would make this a regular",5
messed up order and rude staff who refused to correct mistake,1
taiwanese food is awesome ,5
very busy but two floors of tables. great shakes,5
"what you are missing from china home town, you can find it here.",5
the best casino,5
fun place. the heart of chinatown.,4
"delicious korean food. the restaurant was quite spacious, and it will be good for even a big group of people. staff are always staying near to you so i can feel that was good service because you do not need to find a staff for a while! just to let you know, menus are quite pricy!",4
"probably one of our favourite restaurants in london. the food is very tasty and the environment is quite nice. we absolutely adore the jerusalem mess (pictured). even bought the palomar cookbook, thats how much we love this place. slightly on the pricey side but you wont mind once you taste all that yumminess. recommended!",5
wasn't keen. portion size was huge. didn't finish it. veggie options are limited,1
awesome friendly staff and yummy food,4
just good fun,4
great burgers and sides.,5
hot pots!,5
shopping,5
eat all you can for 13.5 pounds,5
really impressed..i got the red velvet and it was so savory. i will definitely try other types as well.,5
"the bar staff were so rude and unhelpful when trying to order food and drinks that we walked out of there this afternoon. she argued with me when i tried to order food for my son, threw a strop when i asked for a drink with no ice. shocking bad service.",1
huge selection on the ground floor and even more upstairs.,4
"love the dumplings here, fast service",4
we spent less than 15 per person for din sum and were stuffed. the quality is good too! as good as royal china which is pricier,5
classic london chinese restaurant. not many like it left!,5
a great little irish pub serving nice beers. staff are warm and friendly. attracts a good crowd. worth a visit or two. prices are reasonable.,4
"barely a 3 star. food was very ""meh"". no service. dont go here",3
barbers always accommodate your requests with minimal instruction needed - they can work purely off of photos you show them!,5
"4.50 for one donut and it doesn't even have much flavour, other reviews are good but this was not.",2
it used to be better but now the staff at cashier is extremely rude to every customer.,2
quick. good. relatively cheap. ,5
"small cafe with delicious asian desserts. you can't book, but they usually try to squeeze you in! service is friendly and quick, plenty of choice on the menu. it is a little pricey for the portion size but to be expected with the high cost of rent in china town. worth a visit, especially if you love mango desserts!",4
"busy always, gets stressfull",3
"lovely cocktails,  a normal price for london (10 per cocktails)  and the option of happy hour which we were too late for.  the kiwi drink was fantastic if you like sweets ones  ",5
"popped into this ice cream shop while visiting london. macarons were crisp on the outside and chewy in the centre, which made for an enjoyable ice cream sandwich. flavours were great - we tried the matcha oreo, taro, red velvet and egg tart (our favourite of the 4). 5 is a little pricey for an every day treat, but quality was good.",4
"lovely selection of szechuan dishes, some of which are quite fiery! quick, friendly service. thank you!",5
unfamiliar flavours but worth the risk. delicious.,5
awful service as presumably because my friend and i didn't order enough as we wanted their a snack and dessert at 11pm. disappointed with the food quality as well- char siu tasted flat and marinated with sugar. reasonable prices but not good enough to justify being essentially kicked out,1
"fast service, good food and overall enjoyable experience. for being in the heart of tourist chinatown, we found this place surprisingly quiet. they are also one of the few restaurants in this area to accept cards. we had a great time, would visit again.  ",4
my favourite chinese restaurant in chinatown.,3
"i guess if you like waiting 40 minutes for a cup of tea, then this place is your cup of tea",2
"great place, amazing udon and soba and the appetizers are super good. they are a conscious diner and really nice. price is usually around 15 per person.",4
very nice great shredded beef,3
went yesterday and the service was awful. ordered beef randang and it arrived after 3 mins. reheated cold beef and starters were off poor quality. overall not impressed even though they reheated the beef it was dried up and tasted bad,1
"if you wants cheap and cheerful chinese food, served quickly, this is a place to go. staff were helpful and friendly, the food was good but not the best i've ever had (the egg was saltier than i liked).",4
best bar in london!!,5
"staff very very rude and unprofessional. they cancelled my appointment 90 minutes before without apology, then charged me for it and refused a refund/ reschedule.",1
"phenomenal doughnuts that manage to be grand and ott without being all style over substance. the doughnuts are light and fluffy, filled well, and not too sweet at all. very happy with the pricing and will be coming back again for more",5
"it looks a bit shabby, but the food was excellent. i also noticed everyone else in their seemed to be korean, which i take as a good recommendation.",4
"the tom yum soup is authentic!! just like in bangkok, had the chicken green curry also tastes real. a great local restaurant.",5
good food. but the waiter wasnt polite and hectic. and its expensive.,3
good food and cheap comparing with other places.,4
"a bit weird, liked it though.",4
weve decided on something spicy for dinner tonight and picked szechuan. this restaurant did not disappoint. the dishes were tasty and surprisingly authentic ! the  or szechuan boiled fish is one of the best ive tasted.,5
"the little lamb hot pot restaurant, which is going to london every year, went a bit late yesterday but still ate it. its so delicious. the waiters attitude is also very good.",5
terrible food. loud place. customers treated like cattle. would rather be hungry then eat there. honey prawns i had were okish but chow mein sucked. same for prawns in ginger sauce. atmosphere truly bad. like in a loud shopping centre.,2
"i've sat inside and it is too crowded, the seats are way to close to the buffet counter and you constantly have people brushing against you. however i much prefer the takeaway. the choice is great, the price is amazing and the quality of food is good too. can't fault it.",4
nice meals and friendly staff! ,4
delicious fast food,5
excellent!!,5
dirty table all sticky. poor service after 20 mins told us one of the orders had sold out. when the food arrived the salmon was over cooked and both the sweet potato fries and the regular fries were tepid. it was my first visit and i shall not be going back ,1
went to that branch for informations and i met saba ! ammmmmmaaaaaaaazing lady. she spendt 20minutes look at my skin and gave me the differents options for free. i am planning now to have my cosmelan peel there. saba you are just a doll.,5
one of londons true hidden gems. the top-floor bar is the perfect for date night and the menu is so jam-packed with creative cocktails that youll find it hard not to order another round.,5
i could not finish the meal. everything felt plastic and soggy. we had 2 different meals and it seemed both had the same poorly cooked ingredients in just a different plate. boring and disappointing.,1
top spot for traditional authentic japanese food,5
"they are very prompt, friendly and accommodating. but my nail polish had chipped in less than 24 hours. the staff had accidentally clipped my cuticle which made my cuticle bleed. my nails in general feels more brittle after this.",1
"the decor of this pub is beautiful, but the food is a bit average",3
"amazing! i love this place. the food was seriously awesome. price was more than reasonable, compared to other seafood and grill restaurant in london. will definitely be back again.",5
"beautiful little store, could do with a few more flavours but not complaining as the doughnuts were delicious",5
very crunchy chicken and very nicely marinated.  nice little chairs to sit in.,4
beautiful venue. full of old world class and cabretta mystique ,4
"dim sum was priced similarly to other places, the dcor inside was nice and the service good. they do runny custard egg buns which you don't get everywhere! i'd definitely visit again.",4
very good quality but a little rushed unfortunately as we were near closing time as we had been to the theatre,4
not the best menu and it felt a bit rushed. but the food was ok.,3
pretty much unchanged in 20 years,5
"the worse place ever. rubbish food, heated over and over again, worse experience ever ever had. definitely not recommend! very disappointed!!!!",1
5 stars only because the ichibuns burger is the best burger i've ever had in london,5
"1st experience: was about to order and staff told me rudely to wait without please or sorry (omg sounded like a queen), seems like i need to beg to be served",1
"the hainan chicken was very disappointing, it did not live up the hype that i have heard from my friends who have visited singapore. the satay chicken was pretty good",2
only thai restaurant in china town. love the food a lot,5
"food is good and fairly priced - i ordered rice with bbq pork two times. what matters to me more is the fact that the waiters were pretty nice and helpful! not what you usually expect from a chinese restaurant, so i will come back again for sure!",4
"great place, great food and for once, smiling peoples",5
"decent food yet too expensive, rude welcome, extreme noise and vibrations from the kitchen ventilation.",2
absolutely a must go! great show. watch the drinks bill though. ,4
food was good. only problem it took ages to arrive to the table. there was only one person in the kitchen on a saturday at lunch time and we were desperate waiting about an hour (if not longer for the food).,4
"very nice portion for the price. absolutely loved that the staff recommended ways in which to eat the meal traditionally, for example one of the dishes we ordered is traditionally eaten with vinegar and a member of staff gave us a bottle of vinegar to enjoy the meal with :)",5
tasty,5
"great service, beer and irish music... beautiful place.. i really recommend",5
"cozy little restaurant. minimum $8/person charge. minimum $10 total order to pay by card, otherwise cash only. food is average but i only tried 2 dishes.",3
cheap tasty food and rude service done to an art form. what's there not for like?,4
one of my favorite dimsum places in london,5
love it specially the custard buns,5
"wow! this place is absolutely superb! food, cocktails, service, design and music! attention to details is just out of this world!we have been there twice in the last few weeks and it blew my mind away both times!thank you!",5
delicious ice cream stuffed in to a freshly cooked bun,4
its not the best.,1
i got food poisoned from their sausage bun and reported this place to the authorities. avoid this place at all costs!!!,1
thumps up,4
very good service,5
always good but music just a bit to ..,5
reasonable value for money nice atmosphere,3
lots of places to eat. tourist attraction.,5
"maybe i didn't pick the right dish, it was ok. i've had better and cheaper in chinatown. friendly staff and quick service, can't fault that.",3
"taste good, reasonable price and generous portion! decent asian restaurant in central london.",4
"amazing dinner!truly great, mouth-numbing sichuan. highlight kidney with black fungus. also very garlicky cucumber.  we also had crab + pork siu mai, amazing green beans, lamb cumin skewers. squid, pork & chicken dishes not too shabby either!will definitely be back!",5
excellent malaysian good - quick and cheap for pre cinema or theatre meal. the roti is excellent,5
"sorry, but in one word...rubbish.  my spring rolls were made with extra thick dough to reduce the filling needed, coming heavy with grease and lacking flavor.  my seafood pho broth was fine, but hardly had any seafood and the noodles were mush to the point i couldnt pick them up with chopsticks.",1
"really interesting menu and fantastic atmosphere. brilliant food, charming service. definitely book ahead as the restaurant is deservedly popular and is only little.",5
great food. highly recommended.,5
smart dress a very famous venue cafe de paris some great parties hope you can dance,5
"this shop definitely has the best the bubble tea in london even the whole uk. every time i will  get rock salt cheese green tea with double tapioca, it's amazing! ",5
very quick service between harry potter parts 1&2,5
something very different and great to experience the local filipino desserts. the desserts provide a lot of colour and texture.,5
"small, cozy and with plenty of great tasting desserts and coffees. hazelnut coffee=",5
"get the dynamite shrimp, it was amazing. really nice feel and the toilets are amazing.",5
"sadly i've heard this place is closing down due to high rents. really tasty fresh noodles, 1 a pack. will be a shame to lose this fine establishment!",5
come here for authentic milk and fruit teas.their signatures are the best - milk tea with pearls and fruit teas are all winners. love that the teas are sourced and all the recipes of milk/fruit teas have their unique flavours. never been disappointed with the quality. definitely recommend!,5
worst service ever. i went to eat with 2 of my younger siblings. they gave us two plates for three people and expected my little brother to eat from the table. requested for a third plate and the waitress said they ondt have anymore plates. we left and went to super star,1
great place...brilliant atmosphere.. excellent staff.x,5
it gets crowded if there is a game on so book in advance if you want a table. good atmosphere. prices were reasonable. service a little slow.,4
have been going regularly for 6+ years and i never grow tired. i really can't find a better japanese restaurant in london and the curry warms my heart ,5
"food ok, it looks they changed the menu recently but still crowded especially in weekends and if some festivities are in the area. i'm glad it didn't rain on sunday when i was, because i've queued for  almost 30 minutes outside the canteen.",3
"bad service, long queue",1
"perfect bubble tea and the most customisable i've had, you can even select your sugar level!",5
"if i could give this place no stars i would. terrible service from alex/sonny who were selling me dreams about what i would get once me and my friends arrive at the venue for my birthday party. absolutely trash should of just gone tiger tiger instead, avoid this unpleasant and unprofessional experience i had to deal with.",1
"the food is delicious and worth the wait. good service, not the best but good enough for a pleasant experience. a 5/5 for viet food! ",5
food was lovely and plenty of it however tables crammed in on the ground flood level. although the wine bottle display was polished the cleanliness of restaurant was very poor with thick dust on most surfaces. staff polite and service fast. ,3
"superb food at great prices, better fried chicken than anything from usa :)",5
"mediocre food at best with ok service. totally shady unitemised bill and they very insistingly tried to collect service twice. only when we insisted, they showed us the itemized bill and claimed that the 12.5% is part of the food price",1
to go place for a strong spontaneous no-fuss massage.,5
nice food. but felt hurried,3
"delicious and fresh dim sum. service was fast and good seating area. waiter staff helpful and efficient but not anything additional. not a problem. food very tasty, recommend cheng fun and prawn dumplings.",4
good food,5
if i could leave no stars i would food is cold and tasteless they charge an extra ten percent service charge and the round it up so they tried to charge me and extra 3 pounds and it was only me that ate there so a buffet a lemonade came to over 17 quid when it should have been 14.02,1
"excellent music, nice place to make friends and such",5
it was in the right place at the right time a d the beer was good.,4
good choice of chinese and far eastern food s,4
good duck,5
cheung feng ftw,5
"good food, limited bathroom facilities though.",4
absolutely the best outside of asia! we loved the spicy pork ones and the shrimp one!! really really really really good thank you!!!,5
"incredibly cheap (for london), yet their dishes have deep flavour. the only downside is that they only accept cash.",4
great atmosphere much bigger than it appears,5
"i was born and raised in china, but i have to admit that i had the best fried chicken here in london.  very authentic taiwan fried chicken.  i'm so gonna miss it when i'm back to china.",5
"this excellent 'eat-all-you-can' buffet is a regular eatery for me whenever i visit london. it doesn't, however, serve alcoholic drinks (nor can you consume your own).",4
during my meal a beautiful well-groomed woman came in and the staff refused to serve her based on the color of her skin. deeply disturbing.,1
tasty dim sum and attentive waiters,4
delicious food!,5
"forget about the price, forget about the calories and enjoy one of the best doughnuts in town! - nice selection of fillings and great names...definitely recommend this place 5",5
great food and service as always received at leon restaurants.,5
pretty nice place but dont go there if u are poor xd,5
"this place was a miraculous find as a tourist, and offered an amazing american-japanese hybrid experience. from cheeseburger spring rolls to traditional karaage, i loved every bite. the atmosphere and music was also fantastic, will definitely visit again next time i'm on that side of the world!",5
"terrible! i don't often give bad reviews but this was genuinely awful! the food was bland, the service infriendly. i don't know what the other 81 people who reviewed this place had to eat but our food was so gross we had to send it back",1
absolutely appalling service. we left because of the attitude of the receptionist iman. recommend getting some new staff if you dont want your customers suing you for discrimination. ive never been treated so badly by an individual.,1
went there for a wedding banquet. great food and atmosphere,5

"fast, polite service and tasty dim sum, fried rice and dumplings ",5
"delicious thai food, my favorite so far in london!",5
"ideal for a quick lunch on the go. buns were tasty, with interesting flavours, and the restaurant was very cute inside.",5
"what can i say about this place that won't completely undersell it. live dj's, amazing fusion of cuisines and decor to die for. the price could be much higher considering its location and top level of food quality. the toilets are a must visit...",5
"high quality cocktails in a speakeasy atmosphere. expect to be turned away at the door, however, if you show up at peak time underdressed/without attractive company!",4
"had a private party and they did a really good job, the food was great",4
cheapest eat in chinatown but do not expect high quality,3
spacious pub showing football in soho. if you're near soho and want to watch football it's your best choice. good size with multiple screens. and right beside chinatown if you're hungry too,4

"having lived in malaysia for 12 years, to go here is food heaven! really authentic malaysian favourites. lovely friendly staff. highly recommended",5

"very casual eatery, amazing value for money. service is a bit rushed but it has a lively atmosphere and the food tastes great.",5

good value for money. many dishes and dessert. but no coffee or tea included.,4

second boba. loving it.,5
"with 12.50 pounds, i could enjoy quite a wide range of chinese food including roasted dark, roasted pork and many fries and curries, etc.  with this price, having that much choices is not very common in london.  prices are more than fair.  food is very tasty, too.",5
i could not pass through,2
fantastic job with my gel nails.  careful removal.   perfectionist application.  lovely and funny staff.  great value.  highly recommended!,5
it was okay. rice was a little bit cold. some of the dishes didnt have much flavour however the ones that did were nice.  reasonable prices. would suggest you try other places before here.,3
"this place was a-okay. my singaporean laksa was decent but lacking certain oomph factor - it was good but not great, something i could probably replicate easily at home with store-bought laksa paste. i may return if i am in the area and craving malay food.",3
"had a lovely dinner here, the staff is really kind and the food is great",5
"nice bar behind an anonymous door. original/good cocktails. go on a calm night, tends to get corwded otherwise",4

good food low cost :),3

rude staff who questioned my friends mental health when we said we weren't interested in eating there.,1
worst haircut experience! the haircut is so terrible i might as well cut it myself. they were also very dishonest and over charged me. wish i can give them negative stars they are that bad!,1
good chinese food by london standards. most of the food would pass for good in asia. however the xiao long bao do fall short of din tai fung back home.,4
very good haircut with excellent customer service. my new haircut gave me a fab start to the new year!,5
good place to get most of your asian ingredients. just 2ish the isles were bigger.,4
good food and nice service,4
"live music is the star of the show here, theres always something to dance to. fun atmosphere, with good drinks that average other drinks throughout london. go on weekday nights to avoid cover charge. the age range varies a lot but always a good place for a drink and dancing.",4
"busy busy here. food fantastic. staff friendly and helpful. loved it, back again soon",5
good variety of chinese ingredients available. unfortunately couldn't find good dumpling wrappers and had to make do with wonton wrappers instead.,4
great food. typical china town service,5
"the worst chinese i'v been in, complained to staff about bad language from another table  and they just laughed and said it was there human rights...no apology given!!! not a nice but expensive experience!!! wouldn't recommend this place",1
does walking past count,3
"can't comment on the food, decor was lovely but the staff made us feel unwelcome as soon as we entered. felt like an inconvenience and orders were taken with irritation. left out of discomfort.",1
excellent dim sums for very good value. ,5
"should have read the review before we went. highly overpriced for what they are. 9.99 for a desert! had to order at the counter as no one came to our table to take our orders and they had the cheek to charge ~3 of service charge. when queried, they couldn't explain in english. made it hard to challenge. be warned!",1
visit this reastaurant for the first time. tasty chinese food and friendly staff. recommended.,4
nice cozy place in middle of china town. but can be very busy at a times. and kitchen closes too early.,4
"need more sauces, then you get my 5 star",4
whole sale vegetables and food ingredients have been sale here. do not come alone. it is much cheaper to share with your friends.,5
the food was very good but the restaurant is a bit old,5
"its a nice small place, and it has a good food with great prices",5
this is a authentic franchise tea shop from taiwan and the taste is exactly the same as it would be in taiwan. both of my friends loved what they ordered. and i had a fruit tea which makes you feel so  happy.,5
really delicious food. the bubble tea is great too. can't wait to come back.,5
food is good n service is efficient..price ok,4
if live near would go every week,5
great food for a great price.,5

the most delicious food around. we are returning customers. portion sizes are huge and the price is great!! clean and fast service,5
this is a great hidden gem. great food no nonsense service in and out. sometimes there's a q,5
came here for an early dinner. fast service and great food. no waiting at all. excellent customer service.,5
a place trying to be posh but ends up being flat and boring. also very overpriced. staff very nice and friendly though.,2
"love this place, been coming here 15 years and still think their teriyaki chicken is the best.",5
always enjoy a quick visit to the grosvenor.. ,4
the dumplings were disappointing.,3
the bingsu was very nice but the staff are a bit slow in serving and taking orders,4
"cozy, private cafe. quiet atmosphere and great croissants (at least this one venue). there is a lot to choose from and we had a very late breakfast but even then they served breakfast food. i really liked it.+ great coffee!",5
"interesting food, and i like my steak. but the portion is quite small.",4
the rice had no taste and was just awful and too expensive!,1
we will be back soon. authentic hot pot amazing for the cold weather especially when you have a cold!,5
"basic food. nothing remarkable. service was initially slow, but improved. there are better places, but also worse. we will not likely return.",3
a very good and popular chinese restaurant.,4
"what a great place to go, loved the food it was to high standard full of flavour and well presented. enjoyed the theme/styling of the decor and seating arrangements.  all six of us enjoyed our food and felt is was good value. thanks to lovely tia for making the arrangements.",5
fantastic dim sum. simply can't get enough of them! a must go in chinatown.,5
insdustrial food without any sense of taste and flavour...to be avoid at any time regardless the 4.2 on google reviews...,1
the atmosphere is chill and the desserts are delicious. never gonna regret coming! ,4
nice cocktails in a relatively chill atmosphere.  i appreciated the 90's music the dj happened to be playing as well.,4
great place to have a drink. a lot space and it seems that it gets busy at night. not outside drinks are allowed and there is security and bag check point at the doors.,5
delicious! especially the bbq pork buns. the egg tarts are good too,5
"everything you need to cook chinese food, and i mean everything!",5
"the best brown sugar boba, made fresh daily. sells out quickly and longs queue for the quality.",5
"the fried chicken is amazing! flattened chicken breast so succulent and freshly fried when ordered! flavour powders are used to enhance your chicken experience even further with my favourite combination of : cheese, chilli, and salt and pepper!",5
"huge variety, but very long queues",4
"it is worth seeking out this hidden away thai restaurant in chinatown. located upstairs opposite the gielgud theatre, we had been meaning to stop by for a couple of weeks - i'm very glad that we did. the vegetable satay starter and the pad thai were particular stand outs on the menu",4
although  the people  in the reception  were  not  very  friendly,5
this bakery has all the essentials of chinese baked goods and theyre all high quality with reasonable prices. this is a great place to grab a filling bite to eat for the broke college student. i recommend the pork bun and a custard bun for dessert. only 2.70 pounds for both bruh. incredible.,5
"delicious vietnamese food, one of the best in central london.",5
"wow, the line moves extremely quickly, and boy is it worth it! if you're in the area, stop here and come get some!",5
"nice selection of deserts. enjoyed the tart the most. if you are a matcha fan, then a must go place.",4
probably the latest opening restaursnt in chinatown. very good value and food is ok. ,4
amazing! ,5
wonderful dim sum place. my husband and i had a big lunch for 22. the duck fried rolls and egg tarts were fantastic. plenty of chinese people were having lunch there as well. i highly recommend it!,5
"quick dinner, good general restaurant in china town london",4
been here a couple of times now these five stars are for the dry ribs they're amazingly tender!! food is tasty don't need to add anything to your rice for flavour,5
"i love this place. amazingly tasty dumplings. it's cheap and cheerful, so don't expect doting waitstaff. but find a table, order a bowl of dumplings, eat, and feel happy... and then get out to make way for the next customers!",5
great roast duck.,5
tasty food. friendly staff.,5
can get very crowded has a wide range of asian foods as well as fresh fish and meats,4
"visited here during sunday lunchtime.  there was a bit of a queue but we only had to wait 10 mins to be seated. dim sum was nice, service was quick and the portions were a good size. enjoyed it!",4
"woeful, turned away because we werent women? sexist, rude and petiful excuse for a bar.",1
couldn't recommend this place to anybody.,1
"very over priced from atandard dim sum, nothinv spevial, kept delivering us the weong orders, messed up bill, ignored us when we questioned some of the dishes. music was aasian fusion which was funky. not worth the hype unless we bought the wrong dishes.",3
rude and racist proprietor. never coming back again.,1
"the food once disappointed me, but no more now.. i loved their mee siam and it's always be my favourite dish.. bery friendly staffs and fast services too.. but it's not a halal restaurant because they do serve pork menu as well.. ",4
"excellent japanese/korean place for dessert, the shaved ice (soya flavour) and the macha roll is so yummy! its not too sweet and feels very light. i would recommend this place!",4
stay away!!!!,1
good cheap but not exceptional when it comes to dumplings. tasty but a tad small and lacking the broth inside the dumpling. other dishes delicious so for 30 2 people 4 dishes and tea i'd go again.,4
love this place. the best taiwanese restaurant in london and very reasonable prices,5
super great spot to watch rugby matches! slow service but good food!,5
dumpling legends earns name. has the perfect dumpling to prawn ratio. highly recommend the soup dumplings - so flavoursome. vegetable fried rice is also delicious. service was fast. i like how you can watch dumplings being made and cooked. also loved the music - very atmospheric. 5/5,5
"stylish irish pub in the heart of london. great spot to grad a drink or too, they also have a restaurant but i never tried it.",5
"a beautiful place!good music, people and drinks! ",5
great place to visit.. small but nice!,4
outstanding selection of tastes. great service! highly recommended!,5
"great food. bad service. we found a stone in our food and the staff was very rude and accused us  of being dishonest. had a really bad experience, will not return.",2
delicious food and quick service. well priced and will definitely go again,4
"good place for enjoying thai food, service correct",4
this place is quite cool and has a different type of bubble tea. it tastes pretty good too!,4
nice little pub on the edge of china town.  the is about a block east of leicester square.   like must pubs in the area this place gets really busy between 5 and 8 pm.  you need to order your food and drinks at the bar but they will bring your food to you when it is ready.  i had the area that was delicious and authentic.,5
"the food was okay; nothing special, but nothing offensive either. customer service was okay too, but they forgot my food order and we had to orders drinks a second time to get them. the duck spring rolls and the dumplings were good though.",2
great food and good service. clean and tidy with an atmosphere that was very cosy. downside was only one beer on the menu and it was a little too warm inside. other than that it's a lovely restaurant with food cooked fresh and perfectly.,4
food was ok-nothing special. service was good but then they try to scam you by adding service charge which is a discretionary 13.5% but charged at almost 40%!! may work for the unsuspecting tourists but not with me so pulled them up on it!,1
best bingsu in the area. highly recommend the mango bingsu. it comes with condensed milk and 3 blocks on mango.i have yet to try the normal menu since the bingsu is such a great purchase.,5
wonderful food,5
"great all you can eat hotpot. if you are familiar with the chongqing style hotpot, this is it. a great range and even the prawns are included in the all-you-can-eat but unfortunately a bowl of rice isnt. great sauce station and lots of space for large groups. pretty straightforward and uncomplicated hot pot with good flavour.",4
"was craving for some chinese dessert and just walk in to this little cafe in chinatown. surprisingly it is so good, matched crepes is awesome not sweet at all. definitely a must try.",5
"takeaway - very quick service, food was good and prices reasonable.",4
pathetic and rude staff. enter at ur own risk,1
must try the lse fried rice. good old chinese fast food,5
"had an extraordinary pancake thing from here, god knows what its real name is. consisted of a fried dough stick placed on a freshly cooked pancake with chinese sausage, spring onion and what tasted like hoisin or similar, then wrapped up in a cone. extremely necessary.",4
these girls are amazing and deliver high quality work and experience every time!!,5
"food was ok, thought slightly expensive for what we ate for myself and my daughter.",3
"lovely wrap, good price for london",5
i thought the prices were quite expensive for what you got. i dined on my own and i had to keep asking for drinks even though the staff could see my glass was empty. service charge was expensive.,2
nice lovely place service is great,5
good service dim sums amazing,5
well made cocktails but not experimental by any means ,4
troi oii ngon just like home.,5
"nice ""sports bar"" type drinking establishment. reasonable'ish prices. could have a better selection of beers.",4
"amazing food, not so much variety but everything is really nice. the stuff is very helpfull with everything. the total for 4 persons 4 soft drinks and the service charge was 62, decent amount for that amount of food. coming again if i am around here.",5
great selection but the queue is always massive,4
good selection of drinks and durch food! good atmosphere in what is an already atmospheric area.  like hems!,5
"good chinese crepe. i got the one with everything. it has egg, fried dough, pickles, sausage and pork belly. only 6 and it was so big and very filling. very generous with the pork. sausage is quite salty so not needed if you want the pork belly. it's a tiny place and only has 2 seats. fast service.",5
"good value for money with one of the many vouchers available. that said, food was only average and was waiting 30 mins between courses despite it not even being peak time...",3
"terrible fried rice and mean staff. do not recommend. the fried rice was not fresh, service was very very slow. also not enough restrooms",1
taiwanese taste!3.95(large),4
great foods n good service.will go back again.,5
"love their hot pot and fish, so spicy and tasty.",5
lovely restaurant! amazing food and nice environment.,4
"excellent and delicious restaurant, came here with my wife and kids for dinner. it does get busy very quickly so do make a booking. the pad thai was the best i ever had, my wife loved the chicken katsu curry. it's very affordable compared to other restaurants in china town. we will visit again soon! thanks.",5
"friendly service, good food, great cocktails, restaurant is small and tables are a bit cramped.",4
"the food here is amazing! everything was bursting with delicious flavours. the price was decent too, so we're the portion size too. if you haven't been, then definitely go! i know i will be visiting again ",5
great place with great food from japan,5
the real stuff,5
awful!,1
"kimchi soup, bbq roasted chicken, pan cakes and seewed..this few items always im ordered",4
rudest waiter ever seen. it's a torture eating in rather than enjoying a proper meal. stay away from this restaurant. ,1
as expected london prices but has a huge amount of character and always on the list of places to visit when in london ,5
fresh food good value house wine.  friendly staff,5
love the crispy roast duck here. need to try to appreciate it. ,5
nice one,5
"this is my favorite asian supermarket. reasonable price and lots of options.it has enough korean ingredients to cook korean food. however, it is always too busy to get the counter to pay for stuff quickly. i should queue all the time.",5
"not to bad at all, good value and friendly",4
"excellent menu, lots of dishes are not to miss. egg drop crab is perfectly balanced, taro dumplings and cuttlefish and prawn toast are perfect - don't miss out on the numbing tendon either!",5
it was so nice such an experience. the ice cream and waffle was so good together,5
"in chinatown they have great promotions on cocktails, but it's not in every one from the chain, for example the one in o2 has different prices and promotions",4
lovely staff and fantastic food. would 100% return and recommend. ,5
"yummy ribs, lemon chicken, friend chicken wings and fried rice. great service and they never rush you like some other places.",4
great staff but poorly organised,3
"love this place,small but perfect.",5
eye wateringly pricey for an average experience... but the korean fried chicken is superb!!!,3
"love this place, great customer service, i love the atmosphere and the celtic ambiance. must see!",5
lovely chinese meal with my husband,5
"4 of us took a chance on this restaurant on sat. very pleased, good fast service, polite staff,very nice clean and food too class. will eat there again",5
good deals and 2for1 cocktails until 10pm,4
had a cracking night.  our party experienced nothing but the up most polite and helpful staff from the waiting staff to the door men which i had read bad reviews but could not fault anything would highly recommend and will definitely be returning thank you all at cafe de paris,5
oh my pho!!!,5
fun laughter and quality music,5
really cool pub,5
"went there last week for lunch. new menu with a great selection of authentic dishes. ordered roasted honey pork, roasted crispy pork belly, chicken with ginger and wine casserole. simple and comfortable environment, and reasonable price. will be coming back again.",5
"great food, good service. my go to venue for getting together with my friends.",4
"had the seaweed flavour, portions decent size but soggy and a bit bland. go to good friend instead if you have the choice",2
absolute best in chinatown in my opinion! truly authentic experience ;),5
very tasty dumplings. definitely try the pork xiao ones!,4
great restaurant with an excellent service.,5
"i like japanese food. the food was not bad, but nothing special. i asked for a bento box and i have the impression that lickles were really cold and the same from the vegetables. it waslike they came straigh from the fridge.",2
awfully! don't go there!,1
good dim sum,5
great food but service is a bit miserable,4
great chinese food and service,5
"as close to a hong kong style bakery you can get in london, the cakes here are delicious, the custard tarts are fantastic. everything freshly baked. prices typical of chinatown so well worth a visit for a sugar rush",5
food was very average and the place is super crowded. price is cheap so i guess you get what you pay for.,3
food was excellent and the staff were friendly. didn't wait long between courses.,5
"mediocre food but fair for the price. also: be warned, you will come out smelling entirely of fumes and bbq!",3
"food was terrible, they charge you 10% extra for nothing.i do not recommend.",1
very very rude,1
amazing!,5
always fun to be in london and visit a dutch pub. nice athmosphere.,5

omg so good.  staff were friendly the bubblewrap was sooooo good,5
tasty chicken! don't order too much.,5
great friend chicken,5
"ate here based on reviews and was not disappointed, really good food and big portions, we were absolutely stuffed. would definitely come again",5
i have lived in hong kong and beijing. this is one of the best chinese meals i have ever had.highly recommended,5
nice experience! delicious!,4
great finger food.  daily special was divine.,5
can't recommend this place enough.the portions are humongous and the prices are great for central london,5
 not yum and the service ruined my day,1
best dessert in a while.,5
it has everything you could possibly need. but could get really busy in the evening. sometimes you might have to queue to pay for more than 10 mins along extremely narrow aisles of products. staffs however are nice and friendly.,3
as the name this is a very good restaurant. it is not far from our hotel near soho.  you can order whatever you want without concerning too much about money because they charge you local price not tourist price.,5
"doughnuts were much too large and hard to eat, nothing really exciting about the taste and quiet expensive as well. i only got one as i had heard they were good. will prob not visit again.",2
"service is horrible, i have never seen anything like that. the staff really doesnt care about costumers and is very rude. they simply made us leave the place with no reason but to have more vacant tables. in the end, they mistreated my friends and me while we were trying to complain about the service and completely ignored us.",1
"i'm always getting the cheesecake when i'm here, absolute treat! milk tea of all sorts are also great. a go to whenever i'm in london.",5
"they have some decedent products, but the prices are really high. i personally use a lot of korean skincare products, so i know the normal prices (that are considerably lower even after paying import taxes and vat). i would recommend buying from here only if you need something quick and you don't want to shop around for too long.",2
easy eat and more flavour of chinese cuisine with a lot of fried choice than real japanese.... they don't even have sashimi on the menu,3
"great place to do your asian grocery shopping. as i am from a city with a much larger asian population, i am used to having a wide variety of different asian ingredients and food to choose from. this chinatown may be small but it provides enough to make me feel like i can cook my own dishes as if i were at home.",5
they have some dope ice cream. seemed to be in a rush kicking us out as soon as we had our order.,4
staff were excellent. recommend the lavender dream. good to start a big night or finish a big day.,4
"good dim sum, very busy in the evening but managed to find us room without a booking. i think the busyness let's it down a bit in terms of service, given the price.",3
great oriental supermarket. helpful staff and lots of different products.,4
nice and simple.. good cheap eat,4
"questionably clean, make sure you check your crockery and drinkware. wonderful hot pot. waiter forgot some items but was good overall. pay in cash for 10% discount",3
very nice place to eat drink and dance after all (but not cheap),4
"i usually come here for lunch, food and prices are both wonderful. the service is not very good but it is fine for me. i won't suggest you to come in during dinner time, too many customers!",4
"lovely food, decent portion size and reasonable price.",5
food was ok until they spilt sauce all over our table and my leg! wont be coming back again.,1
absolutely terrible - was half empty but waited 15 mins for service. told we had theatre but had to leave without food. hungry.,1
plenty of space and an authentic feel. but food was only ok and customer service was average at best. after payment totally ignored by staff when leaving.,3
loveley cocktails just coffee machine was broken ,4
good value especially for the location but the food was at best average and the choices were also limited. extremely hot to the point of being uncomfortable. i'd pay a bit more and go somewhere else.,3
fantastic food,5
lovely place.,5
lovelly chinese food. staff gentle. i spent a really good time there. will go again in the future. ,4
food is amazing. service is good is just that they get it wrong many times probably because their english is not great. would recommend. ,5
good food..very slow service.,3
"simple, authentic, cheap and delicious.",5
best consistency out of all of the shops in china town,5
"have to try thier beef noodles, summer roll, ice vietnamese coffee and curry. i really love the tastes. u can try to visit during lunch time hours, their got do the lunch time package and the porson are quite big, only coz 10++...",4
good selection of foods good price,4
quite a selection of desserts at a reasonable price,4
great dim sum served all day. price increases after 5pm though.  ,4
very good price to quality ratio,4
"got the salted egg custard bun to take away...it was warm, gooey and pretty delicious. hard to eat without getting messy. pricey for a relatively small custard bun but quality was good.",4
delicious bi bim bap and super service. price was responsible 7,4
fantastic! i went for a walk-in appointment the day before my wedding and came out with beautiful nails that everyone complimented me on. great friendly service.update: the nails lasted really well and i've had so many people compliment my nails. thank you so much! you really are creative and talented.,5
good fast foodtoo many people,4
"starters are a bit small in size, maincourse is decent in size and taste, service is below average.",3
"food is very good, very tasty and the staff is very helpful with advice.",4
"terrible experience:we asked for a kare to share in 2 people. the dish was reasonable, however the establishment has a minimum consumption rule of 5 pounds per person and our bill gave 6 pounds. we were extremely ill treated and forced to ask for something else we did not want.",1
"the hot pot here is amazing. we ordered a spicy and non spicy soup. the order came with meat, seafood selection, vegetables and tofu and mushrooms. the price per person is a bit expensive but when is all you can eat then is a good price for london prices. the staff was attentive. good experience overall. ",5
a must when you go to london the atmosphere is something special try it on a morning the hustle and bustle is a mustthe restaurants are fantastic not to expensive. food good a good day round china town can start or finish the perfect day,5
pandan coconut swiss roll was light and delicious.,4
"cash only. very cheap prices, big portions and the food tasted okay. food came out really quick so its perfect if youre in a hurry and feel like a cheap eat.",3
"very popular, always busy, fast service, beautiful tea.",5
"great staff, good food great fun",4
"good portion for 8 in central considering is a non traditional fried chicken place right in soho. nice batter, no sauces available but a lot of different seasonings. good for a snack after partying or a casual quick lunch. bubble tea was pretty good too.",4
"the best cocktail in chinatown, espresso martini must try!",5
excellent beijing dumplings.,4
"the food was lovely, the service efficient, the bill a bit pricey. great experience!",4
great dumplings....staff were very attentive,4
one of the worst chinese joints i've ever been to. dumplings overloaded with white pepper and spice to hide poor meat quality. bbq meat is also poor quality and drowning in sauce; meat does not appear to be fresh.,1
"terrific food, but slightly too busy",5
recommend the tasting menu!,5
this is one of the coolest restaurants ive been to in the world. its in the heart of chinatown in london and a very good late night place to hang out and get delicious food. the price is reasonable and the service is excellent.,5
lovely bubble tea shop,5
great pub with a fantastic atmosphere,5
"me and my friend went to the tokyo diner in soho a few days ago. was my first japanese meal since coming back from tokyo in may, and the food was incredible, absolutely wolfed it down! reasonable prices as well for central london. about 13 for a chicken katsu curry which was a good sized portion.",5
i love leon food. the shop is always clean and the food is fresh.,4
cool little bar - walked by on a sunday and was drawn in by the jazz music. the jazz band is fab! definitely worth checking out!,5
really tasty food!,4
how does it look ,4
amazing food,5
"came here for a birthday meal while visiting london. food was fantastic, staff were friendly and efficient and overall it was a lovely meal. would be back if we lived closer than we do.",5
"excellent, real chinese food, not the westernised version. enjoyed my lunch.",4
this was a good find in the heart of the west end. good atmosphere and friendly bar staff. it's only downfall is the size of the bar which is tiny and you feel you cannot move inside,4
"nice place, nice food, good portions. but for that price i expect something better",3
"best restaurant in soho. i have been going there on my every visit to london for last 5-6 years, its always very delicious, affordable and fast & friendly service. try, you wont regret it ! keep up the good work guys!",5
great beer and service as usual,5
i think i probably ordered the wrong food as i got the salmon don and it was just ok even for the price. most things are cheaper here but i guess i should try the katsu curry as its supposedly the best in london? it is very busy and they dont have enough staff but you can see they do try their best to get to everyone.,3
"bit overpriced, but food are delicious!",5
"great irish pub! if you have to go to a pub in london this is it. bar staff are great, nice variety of beers, ales, whiskey etc. be aware with the layout of the bar you may get stuck in here which is not a bad thing!",5
"not as good as the one in colindale.we asked for water repeatedly, they only bring it over if you order it with sonthing or pay for bottled water. ive stopped going here as a result.",3
amazing food and cocktails - lovely service. dishes are unique and taste great!,5
friendly staff. not super packed considering it's location. amazing selection of beers.,5
good but not as good as some old viet places around hoxton station,4
a place you have to visit in london,5
the place to go if you want vietnamese food !!!,5
amazing!,5
has good weelchair access and a good vibe for all goot food too,5
"excellent food, ambience and service.  best amongst the rest in chinatown. will come back.",5
the queue was very badly managed and the staff were rude and disorganised. didn't bother waiting for a table as the service seemed so bad while merely waiting that i dread to imagine what it was like if you were actually trying to eat there.,1
"so busy but i do like the cheeseburger,and the milkshake is the boss",4
great food. fast service. try the peking duck and black tea,5
nice good and a fair price,4
good all you can eat hotpot. get the house sauce!,4
"yummy milk tea and dumpling sweet soup, friendly service and good location when you need a little escape from the busy streets of leicester square ad chinatown. however, i dont think customers that are paying for food and other drinks should also have to pay for tap water, especially on a hot day.",4
my favourite is the'pump up the jam'. good way to end a night out.,4
food was not great at all and service one of the worst i've had ever,1
not worth the hype. especially if you want to try some other things than the hot pot dish,3
"amazing food, great value for money",5
"visited this restaurant,  food was below average,  toilets were disgusting,  no atmosphere,  it's a sit eat and go place . if you want a clean better menu  go to a littel moore expensive restaurant  . the old saying you get what you pay for.",1
a favourite chinese restaurant,4
convenient,4
"great malaysian food. i used to come here over 10 years ago when i worked in the area. came back last night and was so pleased to see they still serve a great laksa! its a friendly, busy, good value, non chain, little gem. just what london needs.",5
reliable quality and quick service . prices good too.,4
"just because im not chinese one of the male staff didn't take any of my order and said that he didnt like me then he wont serve my table, he told us to go somewhere else even we didn't do anything?? really bad attitude, discriminated, rude, 100% do not recommend for any asian but not chinese",1
"one word: wow! we were searching for quick food before the musical, popped in that heaven of a place and enjoyed every bite then ordered two more buns to go. wow",5
i honestly don't get how some people like this place,1
pho is wonderful! a good place to have eastern food,5
amazing popcorn chicken. good value,5
"we were there on a wednesday evening in march. we tried many different courses: different kinds of dumplings, prawns with cashew, rice, sweetsour chicken ... the food was plenty and delicious, service quick although the restaurant was full. would definitely recommend. booking advisable on weekends as there can be a long line.",5
my favourite dim sum / yum cha in london. tasty and fresh food that's not just the typical you get. my go to!,5
love shopping here.,4
"japanese food with that authentic japanese taste and feel. wonderful little place that honestly is the closest thing i've found since my time in japan. if you love japanese food, its a must try.",4

lovely,5
"gorgeous desserts of shaven condensed milk and fruit. i absolutely love them. had never had the food but it looks great too! only problem is, the place is very small and usuay have to wait long times to be seated. but recommend to try!",4
amazing fried chicken snack and very good prices. nothing like it in london.,5
wider variety than other restaurants of my favourite dimsum and some tasty variations. excellent presentation.  the manager always make sure we have  a table big enough to accommodate all of us on the top floor.,4
"food is average, priced was abit above than average. went here during high peak hours, the place can get very busy and full. you could come here once in a while if your not in the mood for chinese so it is an option. but food could be improved",3
food is ok and overprice for value!,3
"this is one of the best chinese restaurants in the area, the food (only ever tried dim sum) is glorious, staff courteous (such rarity in china town!) and the interior stylish.",5
good food and prices but service is very slow.,3
the only place in london that serves proper korean desserts!,5
"great food, excellent dim sum.",5
"nice people, good service and family friendly!",4
amazing ice cream! really fast service and was quite cheap as well,5
not bad chinese food for the price but not outstanding either.,3
it's delicious foods up there,5
"atrociously slow service, waited 40 mins to get served. better off going somewhere else.",1
"the food was very below average and really overpriced. the belly pork was really fatty, there didn't seem to be any beef in the crispy beef, and the rice was cold. the crispy squid starter was the only good part. it came to 45 which is a massive rip-off for such low-quality food. will not be going back.",1
"original atmosphere, good beer selection. this is what i like about original pubs. this one ticks all boxes. ",4
"london's newest and most stylish cocktail lounge, extremely friendly and knowledgable bar tenders serve up an array of new and classic cocktails made with care from the highest quality ingredients.",5
lovely little shop with great books in chinese and for learning the language. some  other typical chinese things can also be bought! lovely person who i guess owns the shop! genuinely interested and a warm person!!! will visit every time i go to london from now on! !!  ,5
"first time ever tried one of these, very pleased with food quality, had chorizo chicken and rice, was lovely, staff very polite, plenty of room inside, clean and tidy tables, good value food, would recommend as an alternative to fast food, just slightly more expensive, but good quality.",4
nice cosy place in chinatown london. had the bingsu. portion sizes were big and bingsu was good.,5
"dimitrius know how to put a great atmosphere, one of the best places in london",5
"a hidden gem of a bar. old school prohibition era, the drinks are incredible and well worth a visit",5
"good delishes,good service",5
"pricey but justified by real yummy food. really worth it! a must try for dim sum lovers. nice ""upper class"" atmosphere compared to other dim sum restaurants in this area.",5
steamed frozen dumplings instead of fresh made.,2
: go if youre in the area & and youre not sure what else is aroundcomfort food which reminds me of singapore,4
great food huge portions,5
very bad,1
the food is good but too much oil for me. small space but relatively friendly staff. i would go again to try their dumping. ,3
attentive staff and not too greasy food! good value for money...,5
"very nice, very friendly,  no more to be said.",5
amazing chinese food in china town,5
"the food is really good! the menu is quite limited, and the seating space is a bit small. i would definitely recommend!",5
seems like a good place,4
nice service. good food. ,4
"great food, great cocktails, hunky staff",5
"be aware of dodgy service charge. no breakdown of receipt. random charge applied on top of lump sum. on request, said that is the additional 10% service charge.  so u will get 24% service charge bill.",1
got the lor mee it was amazing ... great food and fast service,5
"it's fine, i just don't get all the hype... the chicken could be juicier. the sweetish batter has a good crunch and it sets off nicely against the salt & pepper (and tons of msg).at 6 a piece you pay a novelty premium for fried chicken.",3
"funky vibe, excellent deserts and good boba tea.",5
nice place but unhelpful staff,3
friendly staff. music not quite my taste. cocktails decent.,3
"bad service, expensive and not tasty food",1
"delicious, quick ...reasonable!",5
"love this place, i've been 4 or 5 times and it's never let me down. the dim sum is excellent and very reasonably priced. only been for dinner once but it was with a large group and the food came out in very good time, no issues with wrong orders etc that you'd normally expect. highly recommend.",5
"really nice food and staff. got the platter for starters and the waitress was very helpful, telling us what was what and what sauce was best with each. also had some of the bao burgers which were very tasty. this was finished by the peanut brittle and banana ice cream which was also great. would definitely recommend people check it out.",5
"lovely food, but waiting staff seemed like it was a chore to work there. would come back, but front of house staff let it down",3
rude staff and powder in my bubble tea so much better places in chinatown,2
great food! totally recommend the chicken rice here!,5
"lovely milk tea and tasty, soft and chewy tapioca. i only wish they added more tapioca pearls to my drink! service is fast and friendly.",4
indonesian food very good typical of indonesia,5
"salon was busy but theyre very good knowing that im in the rush, got my wash and cut straight away...with the same lady alice. very pleased with her and the salon.",5
"amazing value, all-you can eat style buffet. not very crowded with great staff",4
great for asian food supply ,4
cheap and relatively tasty. good for a quick and fast eat but nit much more. greasy and lacking on quality but wont kill you either so decent overall,4
very rude staff!,1
brilliant night!!!,5
delicious authentic malaysian food. great service and the food comes in big portions,5
"haven't had a lot of korean food otherwise, but the food here was decent. found it to be on the expensive side though. roughly 25 quid per person. the pork iron plate was quite good, but very oily.",3
"amazing prices! i come here for turmeric root and chicken/fish. prices are so much cheaper than anywhere else and one of the few places in london you can find turmeric root. amazing selection of spices, curry powders, coconut milk, nuts etc. upstairs is japanese/ korean and they have a lot of snacks.",5
me and my partner got the same meal but one cost more than the other.the waitress thought i wanted my pork and rice separate so she charged me 4.00 extra for my meal. made up an excuse to why i had to pay more. gave in as we didn't want to fight in the middle of the restaurant. will not be eating here or recommending this restaurant!,1
"food was barely warm, the duck had a big shard of bone in and there's a 10% service charge.",1
"the staff is quick and helpful. they do speak barely english so before you go to this place try to learn some mandarin. we had dumpling, they were quite tasty but avoid pancakes. it is some matter full of oil.",3
"food are too salty , my friend and i order two bowl of rice which cost 7!!!!! the most expensive rice i ever have !!!!  don't think i'll come again :(((",1
loved it. great food and a good atmosphere. but the stuff could be a bit more attentive.,4
popular chinese restaurant with a huge menu! staff and service is good and the prices are reasonable ,4
best oho in london,5
the bubble teas here are good but the waiting time is long and service slow,2
"if you have never been to wong kei, you have never been to london china town. reasonable price with free green tea(the other chinese restaurants charge 1.50) crispy belly pork is a must try, the restaurant's nickname is upstair downstair. there is a story about that. you gotta find out yourself",5
yummy,4
delicious vietnamese food. there was a big line outside but that didn't matter. once you take your first bite you forget everything. very fresh food and they also have nice cocktails!,5
traditional chinesse dishes and a traditional atmosphere and decorations.,5
a m a z i n g. end of review,5
"we had such a fantastic time. the service and kitchen staff all created such a good atmosphere. we were sat at the kitchen bar, which was superb. the head chef, jeremy, explained the menu to perfection. the food matched the descriptions and was amazing. i couldn't speak more highly of the experience we received. strongly recommend.",5
best chinese restaurant i've ever eaten in. make sure you taste the duck.,5
very good!!,5
"great cocktails, chilled atmosphere for a late drink.",5
loads of interesting looking chinese food and more. very well priced. don't  forget to look upstairs. great.,5
"serving up a very typical chinatown menu, the food does seem slightly better quality than most of the others ive been to. very expensive for what it is with many basic dishes being 20.",3
"delcious and hits the spot after a strong night on the tiles. don't dilly dally, closes before midnight.",5
great buns and cakes.,4
a great place to visit,5
"standard dimsum as always, don't worry about eating hot food on a hot day as they have an amazing aircon!",5
best pork fried dumplings i've ever had! they even made tofo taste good.,5
great place but the dj is not that good!,4
malaysian food! halal! and scrumptious chicken rice  what more can you ask for? ,5
just there it ok,5
"amazing experience. the best thing about this place along with the food is the service. hilariously rude staff. come with a big group to get the best antics. no need to be overly difficult. the magic just happens on it's own. if you don't take it personally, you'll have an absolute laugh.",5
"even one star is not worthy for them. the most terrible service i've ever had. staff were totally unhelpful. i couldn't finish my food as i was in very noisy, uncomfortable seat. it is total worst",1
"friendly & polite, really nice food!",5
well priced place to have a few drinks and grab some good food in london,5
