If I could rate minus stars I would. I truly cannot express how bad this place is....

"Dim sum has lost its tradition here. You just cannot have fusion dim sum - it does not work. Also you need to sort out the waitering service...which was lousy. And buy your Chinese tea leaves from a new supplier, the Po-er tea was substandard. Not on my recommended list of good eats in Soho this year.",2,a month ago
