"Food was lovely, and very fast service! However, I could not say the same about the drinks. We were repeatedly told they had run out of various elements of each desired cocktail, when we could see other customers around us had the exact same drinks we asked for! Just seems like the staff couldn‚Äôt be bothered.",2,a week ago

Reserved a Table at Slug & Lettuce in Leicester Square and I‚Äôve never received such incredible service. Every single staff member was so helpful and so kind - from the security guard to the bar attendant. I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone! Special shoutout to Nick for going above and beyond. I‚Äôm so happy I got to experience this.,5,2 weeks ago

Slug & Lettuce Piccadilly Circus has a great atmosphere. Their great meals and their 2 for 1 cocktails are and added bonus as-well as very reasonable prices. Very Friendly staff with an amazing venue. Would definitely visit again when I am in the area. Keep it up S&L.,5,2 weeks ago
