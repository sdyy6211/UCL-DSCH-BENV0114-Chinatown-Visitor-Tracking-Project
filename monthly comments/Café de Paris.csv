Does not compare to cabarets in Europe. Tables were small and crowded like everywhere in London. Businesses see you as a dollar sign and not as a customer. They force you to pay 12.5% service when it should have been optional. For a ‚Ä¶,3,a week ago
"Me and a few of our friends decided to go, and we were suggested to book with Alex from londonnightguide. He was very helpful and even suggested the venue for us. The club was spectacular, and we had a lot of fun while dancing all night and the dj kept spinning amazing hits. 100% recommend for any night out.",5,a week ago
"I though if a place charges you ¬£20 on the entrance as a standard price- it must be worth it. Could be more mistaken. The place is small much smaller than it appears on the pictures, full of doggy people (the night when we went there). Just a gin mill. Do not recomend it if you value your money.",1,a week ago

"Promoters approach groups saying they will give you free drinks. Once you pay 20 pounds, drinks never arrive to table and they move you to VIP like they are making you a favour. Once you are there the drink was not even vodka, tasted like water with orange juice. Then they get more people to the downstairs area and so on.",1,a month ago

My fianc√©e and I visited Cafe de Paris in early December 2019 for their three course dinner and Cabaret evening. The food was delicious and the Cabaret was excellent. The acts were of an incredibly high standard with a brilliant and hilarious host. We can't wait to visit again with friends!,5,2 months ago
The venue was spot on. The team knew exactly what they were doing in terms of food distribution . They were so open to making the evening totally customised  to our needs. Would wholeheartedly recommend,5,2 months ago
