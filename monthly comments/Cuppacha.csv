Good bubble tea!,4,a week ago
"I love their bubble teas, but sadly the quality is uneven. Four times on five they are excellent, and the fifth time it's disappointing with flavourless tea. Often quite busy. A lot of options, I already came here at least a dozen of times and there is still stuff I'd like to try.",4,a week ago

"Intriguing place.

Took forever to be served. The woman serving me took a few minutes to work out how to give me 85 pence change for a Â£5 note.

I ended up receiving 50p in 5p's and 35p in 1 and 2p's.

The drink took such a long time to be made too.

2/10 - won't go again.",2,2 months ago
