Absolutely awful. It was a disgusting dessert! Way overpriced for such a small portion! Definitely not worth going too! And the worse thing was the service charge - £1:50 extra just because we didn’t buy another item?! Never going back. Unpleasant experience!,1,a month ago
"Cozy and neat little cafe. Dessert are nice, staff is friendly too. Maybe a bit expensive for just sweets, but the presentation does look good and the dessert/sweets are also not bad. Recommended",4,2 months ago
Very friendly staff. Desserts weren't too sweet. A bit overpriced.,4,2 months ago
