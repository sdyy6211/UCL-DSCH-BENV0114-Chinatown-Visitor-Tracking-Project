"Really fun cocktail bar, each cocktail was specially designed with a story and presentation.",5,3 days ago
"Was recommended this place by a colleague, quite hidden away and all the way upstairs but once inside, you feel very cosy. The music playing was 80s which was very different and nice (I'm an 80s-90s kid). It does remind me of japanese restaurants which are hidden away all the way upstairs via narrow stairs. The cocktails were nice.",4,3 days ago

The quality of the cocktails reflects this. So I do feel that when it comes to the drinks you kind of get what you pay for.,4,4 days ago

"Great mocktails, the staff were very friendly and the atmosphere was great. The music was just the right volume so you could have a conversation without having to shout, which was a nice change from most other places I have been to.",5,5 days ago

"A bit expensive but it was well worth it. No pictures as we were too busy enjoying the music, the ambiance and the delicious cocktails. There are quite a lot of fancy cocktail bars at the moment that have cool gimmicks but here they also tasted delicious. Highly recommend this place, but maybe after payday.",5,2 weeks ago

The doorman was immediately rude and aggressive. I have no idea how he managed to conjure up such nastiness so quickly. We were two sober people and all we did was politely ask to come in. He looked at us as if we'd asked a ridiculous ‚Ä¶,1,a month ago

Pretty niche,4,a month ago
"An amazing bar. 

We visited on New year's Eve, at around 7pm. We'd booked in advance, but the area we sat in was pretty quiet. 

We were a group of 10 and ordered a few drinks each - uniformly great cocktails and a super friendly set of bartenders and servers. 

I'd heartily recommend it.",5,a month ago

"Awfully customer service, door man extremely rude. 
Simple asked how long the wait would be for 4 of us as it was raining. Doorman said we were being ""mouthy"" which is impressive for us only being there 2 minutes.  When we asked to speak to the manager he refused. Very disappointed as we were excited to go here.",1,2 months ago
