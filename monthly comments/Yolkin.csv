"Absolutely amazing macaroon ice cream sandwiches! 
Me and my sister were visiting London from Canada and were blown away by these ice cream sandwiches. They are so unique and so delicious, the macaroons are delightful and the ice cream is also delicious. These are a must try if you are in London!",5,a month ago
Brownie ice cream sandwich with a scoop of coconut matcha - the brownies were really good but the coconut ice cream was ok. It's pricy and by the time we went there (around 3 oclock) the special ice cream sandwiches were almost already gone.,3,a month ago
