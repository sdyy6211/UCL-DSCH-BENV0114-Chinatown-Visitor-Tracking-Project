"Had a mid-week lunch here - good sharing plates and options, Jerusalem chicken has good flavor to it, but could have been more succulent. Other dishes were average.  The Bread and dips were fine but nothing to make this restaurant more favorable than other Mediterranean ones in London.",4,3 weeks ago

"Probably one of our favourite restaurants in London. The food is very tasty and the environment is quite nice. We absolutely adore the Jerusalem mess (pictured). Even bought the Palomar cookbook, thats how much we love this place. Slightly on the pricey side but you won’t mind once you taste all that yumminess. Recommended!",5,3 weeks ago

One of my favourite places to eat in London.  You sit at the bar.  Can’t book so you need to put your name down.  I recommend doing this around 18:00 if you’re prepared to eat later.  There are sittings for 18:00 that you can book in advanced if you’re happy to eat early.,5,a month ago

One of my favorite restaurants ever. There is nothing on their menu that I tried and didn't like. I try to go every time I'm in London. I recently purchased their cookbook (they sell it at the restaurant). I am excited to try some of the recipes. Service is fast and friendly. Highly recommend.,5,a month ago
"I sat at the counter, and there's a fantastic energy there. Too much of London is merely pleasant and polite---this place was refreshingly fun and alive. Food and cocktails were excellent. I especially enjoyed the octopus but was dining solo so didn't get to try too many things. Will be back!",5,a month ago

Brilliant brilliant brilliant venue. The food was AMAZING but the experience of sitting in front of the chef while he did his thing was brilliant. Definitely recommend to visit & try everything.
