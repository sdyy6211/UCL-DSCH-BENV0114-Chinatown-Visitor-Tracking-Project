Just had a meal at Tao Tao Ju this evening and I must say it was very tasty served buy courteous staff who went out of their way to please and even gave us half a glass of wine gratis. I would definitely recommend this restaurant as good value with nice surroundings and lovely staff. A gem in China town.,5,a month ago
