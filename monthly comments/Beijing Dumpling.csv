"We had so much expectations walking in thinking we would get the Xiao Long Bao(soup dumplings) filled with mouth burning broth, which is the main selling point of the restaurant, but we were disappointed slightly. The XLB had very little broth inside. But other dishes that we had weren't too bad.",3,a week ago
