Very nice ice tea place. Their speciality is in lemon and citric flavours (surprisingly!) but they do milky and warmer teas too. Its a small place with a little seat for sitting while you wait but it's not big enough to sit in while you …,5,a week ago

"I usually go the bubble tea next door, but sometimes it's overbusy so I go to Happy Lemon instead. The quality is great, they have a lot of flavours but not everything is listed in the menu. Their bubble teas are quite consistent, next time I'll try medium size.",5,a week ago

"They got my order wrong: I asked for a taro milk tea and when I got it the tea was not purple and tasted like a normal milk tea! If they’d ran out I’d have rather been told than given one I don’t like! Service was fast however I wasn’t asked what sweetness/ice level I wanted,",2,2 weeks ago

"Loved their brown sugar boba, perfect amount of sweetness (for me). Small place but fast service. We had to wait 15 mins because of the queue but it's worth the wait! Surely coming back.",5,a month ago

"I give Happy Lemon 4* because while my chocolate with salted cream cheese was the perfect blend of sweet and smooth cream, the pearl texture could be better! They didn’t have the normal QQ bounce, ever so slightly stiff. That said, the lids …",4,2 months ago
