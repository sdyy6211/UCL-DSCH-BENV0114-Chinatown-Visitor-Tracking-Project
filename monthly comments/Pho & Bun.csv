Really great atmosphere and food and the staff are incredibly friendly. We had the special platter for starter and pork belly bao burgers and the grilled bananas for dessert and a few cocktails and couldn't fault any of it. Definitely would recommend!,5,a week ago
"Really Nice food and staff. Got the platter for starters and the waitress was very helpful, telling us what was what and what sauce was best with each. Also had some of the bao burgers which were very tasty. This was finished by the peanut brittle and banana ice cream which was also great. Would definitely recommend people check it out.",5,a week ago

Nice food and service. Set lunch meal £9.95 for an appetizer and main is the best value lunch during my short trip in London,4,4 weeks ago
The food here is delicious but it’s a little tight in space. A woman at the table next to me knocked her glass of water and I ended up with a soaking wet leg. Staff could also be a little more attentive - it was difficult to get another drink and ask for the bill. 10/10 for food though,4,a month ago

"Hot, tasty pho. I asked for no coriander and they did as requested. Their cold Vietnamese drip coffee was super tasty. Uses lemon instead of lime in the pho which is unusual. The sweet potato veggie curry is delicious!",5,a month ago

"Lovely food and service. As most places, can get very cramped and right up against a stranger's shoulder and conversation. Not the best place to discuss secret plots. Perhaps good for giving bad news to someone so they don't make a scene? Either way, if you want good Vietnamese food next to the theatres, this is a great choice.",4,a month ago
