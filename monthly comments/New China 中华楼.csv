"New China Restaurant is our favorite Chinese restaurant in London. Some of our favorite dishes include the spicy garlic prawns and the chicken corn soup. The restaurant has an upstairs and downstairs, so if you walk by and see that the main floor is full, don't lose your hopes of getting a table.",5,a month ago

The Young Chow fried rice and the BBQ selection was good compared with other restaurants nearby.,4,4 months ago
"Great all you can eat hotpot. If you are familiar with the Chongqing style hotpot, this is it. A great range and even the prawns are included in the all-you-can-eat but unfortunately a bowl of rice isnt. 

Great sauce station and lots of space for large groups. Pretty straightforward and uncomplicated hot pot with good flavour.",4,4 months ago
