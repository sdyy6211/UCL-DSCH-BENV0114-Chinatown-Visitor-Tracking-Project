Restaurant is beautiful. Staff is fast. Food also comes very fast! However the size of food served is out of proportion... extremly big. And one of the dishes we had tasted burned. And I had some crab-‚Äúbone‚Äù in my squid dish (?!?#?!>%#),3,3 weeks ago

Walked in. A table was pointed to upstairs which we sat at.... for over 10 minutes without being offered a drink or anything. Staff looked miserable and one waitress just staring into space. Walked out eventually and went elsewhere. Avoid!!,1,3 weeks ago

Diarhea!! Was good at the time tho. Bbq pork was good. The ribs were ok but served cold. Prawn Toast was awsome. Soup was soup but good. Peking duck was dry and the pancakes were extremely dry and flour. Mixed Dim sums were pretty good. Service was quick and nice.,2,2 months ago
The quality of the food served here was so disappointing and overpriced! We were served a bowl of sparse fried vegetables in a largely gelatinous flavored curry for 23 pounds. I observed at least 20% of the seated guests on our floor get up ‚Ä¶,1,2 months ago
