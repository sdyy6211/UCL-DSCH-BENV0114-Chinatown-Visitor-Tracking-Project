"I couldn't fault the service or the food, although there was a small que, as a family we were seated reasonably quickly. 
We ordered from one of the set menus and the food was brought to the table, in good timing so you were never felt rushed, or had to wait long for the next course.",4,a month ago

Good food but we are regular and the bill was more as this week they putting service charge up by 10% I refused to pay as the service was not good on 2 occasions the waiter tried to clear the table while I was still eating. So after probably 25 years I won't be back,2,a month ago

Food was OK-ish. Service was not. Having waited 40 minutes for our main course we had lost our appetite and as such asked for the bill. They deducted £4 for not providing the mains! Shocking treatment when they admitted they had got it wrong. Would not recommend this place ever.,1,a month ago
