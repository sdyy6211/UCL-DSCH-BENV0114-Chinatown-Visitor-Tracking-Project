"Awful employees!
They will make a mistake on your drink. Rather than apologise and excuse the very loud music as an understandable reason, they get upset with you and insist that you pay for whatever they made. 

Never go unless you want to deal with very snooty, snobby spoiled brats as your bartenders.",2,a week ago

"We wanted to have few cocktails, but alas, door staff refused entry and were fairly rude about it. No worries, it's London, so we went to Mr Foggs - doorman was very welcoming and we had an amazing time there. Avoid this place - go to Mr Foggs.",1,3 weeks ago

"Not too many cocktail for being an ‚Äúexperimental cocktail bar‚Äù. They served our cocktail literally 10 seconds after the order, which means was already prepared. Cocktail looks like a glass of water. And they gave us the bill straight away ‚Ä¶",1,a month ago

"The place is nice, good music but way too loud for a bar which makes it hard to have a conversation, cocktail list also not too varied for a place who serves mainly cocktails. The cocktails were also unfamiliar, i know it's experimental ‚Ä¶",3,a month ago

Decent place with great location in Chinatown. I little difficult to fine but I suppose that's part of the appeal. Staff and service where both great but the cocktails where a little disappointing. By no means bad but I have had better for the price. Will go back as the place is nice.,4,a month ago
