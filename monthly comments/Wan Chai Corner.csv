This is the worst Chinese restaurant I‚Äôve ever been to. Very rude staff. Overly greasy food. I will never make the mistake of coming here again.,1,4 weeks ago
Very good service. Food came pretty quickly (in a good way). Taste is just like Hong Kong. Owner was also very kind to offer some roast duck sauce to take away when I requested. Will definitely come back for more authentic Cantonese dishes!,5,a month ago
