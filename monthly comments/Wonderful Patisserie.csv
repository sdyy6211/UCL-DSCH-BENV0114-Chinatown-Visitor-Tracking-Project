"My sisters just bought a coffee roll cake for £5 from there. THE CAKE WAS MOULDY. We called and the woman on the phone was rude and said we have to come back to get a refund. Coming back would mean £3 bus fare on top of the price of the mouldy cake. Never purchasing from them again, avoid at all costs",1,7 hours ago

"Bought a black forest cake with strawberry on top. When i got home my excited son took the strawberry only to find out it has molds underneath it. Good thing i was it before he ate it, otherwise he could have been sick this christmas. Very disappointing as for the price i was expecting they'd sell fresh cakes",1,2 months ago

"It's a large Chinese cake shop (with  an Anglo/french name) and they sell all manner of Chinese cakes and pastries. Sweet and savoury.
The coconut finger thing was nice, as was the sausage bun. They have loads of different varieties and some quite unusual variations. Worth a visit.",3,4 months ago
"(Translated by Google) The price is slightly more expensive, but worth it

The only place in Chinatown that sells Kiki noodles. Breads and cakes selections are really nice. The pineapple cakes are great. I have also bought 粽子 from them before and it was moist and the fillings are generous. The staff are all much friendlier than most other places in Chinatown. Very helpful and not rushing customers.,5,5 months ago
