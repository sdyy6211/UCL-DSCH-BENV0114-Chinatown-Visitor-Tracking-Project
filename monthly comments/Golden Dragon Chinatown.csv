"Simply disappointing & dishes being served were not reflective of any merits of true Chinese cooking! I couldn’t believe within 5 minutes after making our orders, 5 different cooking styles of dishes were ready which was truly impossible & something was definitely wrong! No need to mention the tastiness of those dishes!",1,a week ago

"Wow, the waiters are unbelievably rude. It was comedic. We had a good laugh about how they blatantly did not bother hiding their disdain for customer service. Shockingly bad! The food on the other hand, was really delicious and well priced. Recommend if you don't particularly care for service/ambience.",4,2 weeks ago
