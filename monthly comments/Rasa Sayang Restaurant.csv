"ü•òFood is good. Service is good. Price is Okey to be a bit pricy as it is in China Town. The awkward thing is the way they put table for customers. If you order more than 2 dishes, definitely you will be struggling for spacing. And the tables are very closed each other and felt uncomfortable for customers.",4,2 weeks ago

"My humble opinion on their Malaysia food is just an average. It is not bad but not as delicious as the review by others. In term of their service wise, can be improved better because of their staff comes across less friendly and a bit fierce.
