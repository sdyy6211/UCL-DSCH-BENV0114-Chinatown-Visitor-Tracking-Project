I keep coming for their dim-sums and I haven't been to other places since I've discovered them. I think their lunch and dinner Dim Sum Menus are priced differently. The lunch one is super amazing value (full belly and under ¬£35 for 2) and ‚Ä¶,5,a month ago

"The best dim sum in Chinatown! Tastes really good for a good price, and the staff are really kind. If you order a lot or too little they'll let you know, especially if they can tell you're inexperienced with dim sum. I've taken many friends here for lunch. I haven't ordered from the main menu though, so I'm not sure how it is.",5,a month ago
