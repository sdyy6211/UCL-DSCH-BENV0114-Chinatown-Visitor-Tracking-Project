"Authentic Malaysian food
Had the Hokkien Mee (noodles) which was exactly as one would get in Malaysia - absolutely delicious!

The chicken satay sadly is not as good - seems fried (not charcoal grilled) and the peanut sauce is not that great - still very good.",5,a month ago

"Good service, be prepared for a queue. Char quay teow was really nice. Liked the Rojak (mixture of fried tofu and veg in a sauce), fried chicken wings and the teh tarik.  Did not like the satay or the roti chanai  but that's me, comparing with the authentic taste I am use too.",3,2 months ago
