Great bubble tea! However very inefficient with orders. Took half an hour to get my order. The big reason it's always busy is because they move slow!,3,a month ago

"Nice and authentic. The foam drink was too sweet though. You can get their online app, order it and just collect it there. However, they forgot my order so we waited for a while. They were very busy so I understand but we waited for like 40 mins.",4,a month ago

"Tried their Chatime x Sanrio Tiramisu Milk Tea. It was very sweet - since I opted for regular sugar (which was a mistake I made on my behalf) - but nevertheless, it felt like I was actually eating the dessert. 

Would love to come back and try their other flavoured drink from the collab series.",4,a month ago
