This is the one restaurant I return to time and time again. Beautiful soup dumplings. Staff are efficient but not personable. This is not something you should worry about as when you've queued for 30 mins to get a table you appreciate the efficiency of the place. Service is charged on all tables. They served tap water. Food is great.,5,5 days ago
