Hands down the best customer service I’ve experienced. The food was great but the level of service just took it to another level. I think Rick was the gentleman who served us. We’ll definitely be going back,5,a day ago

Average  food. More expensive than others around the immediate area. Charges extra for anything extra including fresh chilli. Not worth it in my opinion. Also rude manager who adds the bill up in Chinese so you don’t exactly know what your paying for. Go to the place next door,2,2 weeks ago

"Asked for NO NUTS because of allergies.
Got told no nuts were in any of the dishes we wanted, and it should be completely safe.
Ruined the rest of the day, as there definitely was nuts in the dish - non-stop throwing up for hours (normally a sign of peanuts, which in other cases could be DEADLY).

Completely unacceptable, stay away!",1,a month ago

Very rude staff and below average food. What makes it worse is that they try and overcharge you! There are much better restaurants to go to nearby but if you go here make sure you remember how much your meal actually costs otherwise they will try it with you too!,1,2 months ago
