"Yes , a very up market venue, extreamly nice decor, quite lavish , staff seem polite , maybe try to smile, gives me the hump ,  when u get no output, rather robotic, never the less, relaxed  and charmingly soothing atmosphere.",5,6 days ago
"Stephanos hosting is one good reason to come to this classic again and again. Mixed crowd and good vibes upstairs, at the Light Lounge and the Klub.",5,2 weeks ago
"Great location with extreme friendly staff and the cocktails are outstanding - try the Mojito, I bet you will not regret it. Promised!",5,3 weeks ago
Its a good bar but the bar staff have no sense of urgency at all. You stand waiting to be served quietley and politely but they just keep walking past. I guess they are hired on their looks as opposed to their general efficiency... Beauty fades,2,3 weeks ago
