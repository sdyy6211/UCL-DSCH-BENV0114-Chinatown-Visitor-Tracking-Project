"I arrived the second they opened, dying to eat their famous burnt coconut icecream. They hadn't finished making it so I patiently waited and in return for my loyalty they offered it to me in the house! So that was crazy sweet.  Plus now I'm obsessed with this ice cream, it was incredibly delicious!!",5,a week ago

"Overall great ice cream, with their speciality flavors being purple ube and black coconut. The taste is very good but definitely pricey. ¬£4.5 for two modestly sized scoops. Seating is plentiful but cramped and the shop can get very crowded. Worth a slight detour if you're in the area already.",4,2 weeks ago
