"Come here for authentic milk and fruit teas.

Their signatures are the best - milk tea with pearls and fruit teas are all winners. Love that the teas are sourced and all the recipes of milk/fruit teas have their unique flavours. 

Never been disappointed with the quality. Definitely recommend!",5,a month ago
