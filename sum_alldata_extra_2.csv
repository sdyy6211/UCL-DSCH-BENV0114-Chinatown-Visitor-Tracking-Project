great place to get durian deserts,5,BIG C 100 Desserts Cafe

4 of us went. 3 out of 4 desserts ordered are disappointing and the 4th one is just average. hot desserts are not hot enough; the mango pancake has too much cream and too little mango. they are not very efficient either,2,BIG C 100 Desserts Cafe
"the waitress were very nice and kind, even though one of them was learning english and didn't know much. the strawberry milkshake is the best that i ever tried, good price and feels like you are not in london but in china. the decoration is superb, we need more places like this.",5,BIG C 100 Desserts Cafe

new dessert hong kong dessert place in chinatown. wide selection but quite stingy with the mango as quite a big difference with the image. reasonable service but i know a few other places i would choose over this one.,3,BIG C 100 Desserts Cafe
overrated. very small servings. very exorbitantly expensive. not very good. candy cafe is much better for the same desserts.,1,BIG C 100 Desserts Cafe
poor services. we have been waiting for 20 minutes for our desserts. when my friend asked the staff 2 times to check our order and she stared at us without any apologizes (even her manager was sitting next to us and she kept using her computer without saying anything) . never come back again.,1,BIG C 100 Desserts Cafe
"4/6 items we asked for was either unavailable, sold out or missing ingredients...  very disappointing.  service wasn't great, the waitress lacked enthusiasm, gave the vibe that she can't be bothered and only when i pay to tell me cash only...  not sure if i will go back any time soon.",1,BIG C 100 Desserts Cafe

communist decor. good food. affordable too. what more could you want?,4,Baiwei
food is too expensive and service too bad. cash only!!!!!!!! no card!!!!!!,2,Baiwei
"this place used to be amazing. the new menu is poor, terrible in fact. seems like an attempt to sell tiny dishes at old prices but they've made them worse too. all the best dishes like fish fragrant aubergine, cumin lamb, green beans with mince pork and garlic and twice cooked szechuan pork are gone. please bring the old menu back!",2,Baiwei
place is very small but the food is good!,4,Baiwei

great authentic chinese food,5,Baiwei
authentic and tasty sichuan restaurant with fast and friendly service,5,Baiwei
"great szechuan dishes bursting with amazing tastes of china in a small restaurant that will make you feel as if your were transported to a rural town in china. service was also patient and friendly. prawn, chicken and pork dishes were great. lamb dish was less successful. they have great teas too!",4,Baiwei
"authentic sichuan cooking, fried fish in chilli oil and shredded tofu  was amazing!",5,Baiwei
good food at reasonable prices and large quantities. would come again.,4,Baiwei
authentic sichuan food at a very reasonable price. we were a group of 6 and had to wait 15 minutes to sit down but it was worth it. everything was delicious but the cauliflower stir fry and the fried pork belly were amazing!,5,Baiwei

"lovely selection of szechuan dishes, some of which are quite fiery! quick, friendly service. thank you!",5,Baiwei
ok sichuan food. quick service but without a smile or warmth. and would not accept card payment for an 80 pound bill. had to walk down to the local atm to get cash to pay. my local kebab house and chinese takeaway even take card payments!!,2,Baiwei
"one of my favourite restaurants in london; serves authentic chinese food for a reasonable price. also serve super quickly so its very ideal for the ever hungry person!! every dish ive tried has been really good, highly recommend the .",5,Baiwei
below average. very salty (nearly inedible) food. service was ok. theres plenty more options on your door step,2,Baiwei
my favourite place for chinese food in chinatown. it tastes amazing!,5,Baiwei
portions were way to smallwould not recommend for families,1,Baiwei
i ate  my first time there and i must say the food was  very tasty.  will definitely come back ,5,Baiwei
"always go here when im in london. great place , great food. good spicy food. authentic.",5,Baiwei
"server refused to take an order for another dish saying ""you can only order once"", and that stupid policy is not listed/specified anywhere. average food. don't waste your time or money here, as they don't value your money as paying customers.",1,Baiwei
overpriced!!!!! - tasty enough and quick but 12 quid for what seemed half a dish. get yourself to silk road in camberwell.,2,Baiwei
"worst customer service ever !!!! they don't realise we actually pay for the food and not the other way round. not sure who the hell runs this place ... i will never return nor recommend th place , in fact would talk about this to all my friends who visit china town!!",1,Baiwei
"we went there on wednesday night, it's now sunday morning and i'm only just getting over the worst side effects of the worst food poisoning i've ever had - good meal, but worth 72 hours of spewing, don't think so! the doctor told me it was from eating reheated undercooked/improperly stored rice. might have put me off chinese forever... ",1,Baiwei
really authentic chinese place. we ordered 4 dishes and rice and it was more than plenty for 3 people. juices weer delicious. ,5,Baiwei
"some dishes (vegetables) were really good, most of the meats were just mediocre. come for the spicy food, but only if you're craving something spicy. wouldn't go out of my way to come back here.",3,Baiwei
excellent hotpot.,5,Baiwei
"one of the best gems in chinatown to eat. really daring and inspiring dishes on the menu and off the main, busy strip",5,Baiwei

great little place with tasty dishes at reasonable prices.,4,Baiwei
best dim sum.,5,Baiwei
best restaurant in the world meneu verry good and fast team i like it verry much,5,Baiwei
not recommended. this place is trash. the waitress was rude and the food was dirty and worst taste. ,1,Baiwei
the service and the tastes of the foods became worse compare with last year when i visited. the sauce of the fish smells and tastes good but the fish was tasteless. i agree with the other reviews that the male waiter was rude to customer and he kept talking to another waitress which was quite annoying to us.,2,Baiwei
"really good szechuan food nice staff unusual for china town, good prices",5,Baiwei
taste bud overload. if youve never tried it go for it. but be prepared for an other world experience in dining.,4,Baiwei
highly recommendable place for chinese food. excellent dishes are served with a variety of szechuan flavours and spices. the service is also very good. try the homemade plum juice! it goes perfectly with spicy dishes. ,5,Baiwei
"this was my most frequent choice in china town. very affordable and very busy, so didn't expect too much of service, until today we encountered a very rude waiter, slim and middle aged man, i don't want to go back ever again. ",2,Baiwei
"simply the best authentic chinese food i have ever had. a lot of the dishes were unfamiliar to me but the waitress helped me pick a really tasty selection. i was worried about the chilli content but it was always perfectly balanced in every plate of food. cash only, and not a big enough space for really large groups.",5,Baiwei
"great if you want szechuan style cooking, one of the best for it in london. decently priced and the service is what you expect in chinatown. can get crowded but i like the food a lot",5,Baiwei
"delicious! we ordered a bunch of dishes to share, and it was perfect. it was our first time trying all of the food we had. perfect amount of spice and flavor. ",5,Baiwei
"always been one of the better regional chinese restaurants in london although i note the dish size has shrunk while the prices have creeped up. pretty poor service, as per most chinatown restaurants, and cash only.",4,Baiwei
"i was there last saturday with some friends. we ordered 4 different dishes, and everything was delicious. the place is now starred on my google maps :)",5,Baiwei
 recommend to all if u are looking for traditional spicy food.  i really love this place. used to come for lunch all the time. thought i'd leave a nice msg since the staff were treating me well ,5,Baiwei
"i always love food there but they have change the menu and new business idea, in fact i did not enjoy that much like i used to, i guess is ok.",3,Baiwei
"did not feel very authentic. the waiter we had was fine, but the food wasn't great for the price.",2,Baiwei
"i heard good things about this place but wasn't very impressed. i got the mouthwatering chicken ( very very good!) smacked cucumber, which was bland, don't really have any dressing that you would expect and dan dan noodles which were overcooked and claggy.",3,Baiwei
expensive. cash only. service was not great. didn't get all of the dishes we ordered. food was good.,2,Baiwei
great selection,5,Bake 麵包屋
the buns and pastries are good but bubble  waffle is very average.,4,Bake 麵包屋
lovely bakery place. variety of buns and cakes for good price. recommend a visit ,5,Bake 麵包屋
a good variety of sweet and savoury bread and cakes.,4,Bake 麵包屋
"favourite bakery ever. so much choice. they sell bubble waffles, taiyaki and have a huge selection of buns and pastries. the only reason why it isn't 5*s is because the queueing system is never made clear and you have to figure it out for yourself",4,Bake 麵包屋
"finally found a place that sells red bean taiyaki in london, and they are just as good as japan - highly recommended! also love the ice cream in fish shaped cones.",5,Bake 麵包屋
good bread very soft.. even sometimes long q.. but it worth...,5,Bake 麵包屋
great ice cream. the waffle was not so fluffy though,4,Bake 麵包屋
custard bun!,4,Bake 麵包屋
"one of best chinese bakeries in whole uk imo. always fresh, eye-candy buns and good prices. also always great assortment and availability, which is rare for bakeries. a ""must go"" place",5,Bake 麵包屋
"excellent place. great test of locally made waffle with smooth and testy icecream. also the stuffed waffles we're excellent. highly recommend to visit,  especially with kids.",5,Bake 麵包屋
delicious little fish shaped breads with custard filling. highly recommended! the minis are best.,5,Bake 麵包屋
"the woman there gave me fake change, was very rude and the ice cream wasn't that good",1,Bake 麵包屋
"i got the two types of big taiyaki, red bean and nutella. the dough is different from what im used to (chewy cakey), more glutinous inside and crispy outside. youd have to pay more for nutella, so id say go for the red bean unless you hate it! a nice little treat!ps. bread in shop looks gooood",4,Bake 麵包屋
the ice cream is a must have when visiting china town.,5,Bake 麵包屋
"bad customer service. what they call a ""large"" taiyaki is pretty small for the price. the taiyaki with the red bean paste inside is good.",2,Bake 麵包屋
great location and delicious baked goods. the taiyaki soft serve with matcha vanilla blend ice cream is to die for.,5,Bake 麵包屋
so glad they are now sakurado matcha store,5,Bake 麵包屋
"taiyaki with green tea ice cream is nice, however the staff broke my cookie stick and did not change it...and staff team is not nice at all...they look like zombie, no smile, no emotions~",2,Bake 麵包屋
"as usual the ""custard fish"" went down a treat. they had run out of char siu baos, but it was late so not a surprise. the ice creams in a fish shaped cone were delicious.",4,Bake 麵包屋
unfortunately i did not enjoy the taiyaki... the dough was too stodgy on the inside of the large one and there was not much custard in the small ones. the bakery itself is also so packed and they seem in such a hurry to serve you.,2,Bake 麵包屋
"very disappointed, we found hair in our ice cream , we threw it immediately. the ice cream tastes normal.",1,Bake 麵包屋
"lovely place, they have a great selection of baked goods.taiyaki is the best thing you'll ever try in chinatown and i would recommend getting them here.i would love to give bake five stars but i found the lady on till was quite rude and abrupt.",4,Bake 麵包屋
"i've been there several times, the large variety is always fun to try and the food is really cheap so you end up leaving with a bag full of unique snacks, the one snack friends ask me to get everytime i go are those mini taiyaki so make sure you try them as well.",5,Bake 麵包屋
amazing fresh baked goods. highly recommend!,5,Bake 麵包屋
customer services was terrible.,1,Bake 麵包屋

cool place with speical ice cream cones,4,Bake 麵包屋
"matcha ice cream in fresh fish shaped waffle ""cone"" is delicious",5,Bake 麵包屋
"i love everything they offered. but i hate that one elder lady with the glasses!! i simply wanted a fresh taiyaki but she only said ""it's hot, it's hot"". i don't care if it's hot, it's not fresh!",2,Bake 麵包屋
staff at the till so rude to the customer....make an additional order and she was not happy and told me to go away.  so disgusting!!!,1,Bake 麵包屋

"i would queue here for 3 days to get a bag of their custard fish, surprisingly moreish.",5,Bake 麵包屋
"great variety, lots of flavors. the ice-creams and chocolate fish-shape waffle were enough to make you willing to get in and see the rest.",4,Bake 麵包屋

i tried the fish cone green tea and vanilla ice cream and the mini custard filled fishies. both were delicious.,5,Bake 麵包屋
the taiyaki ice cream is awesome. the matcha flavour is tasty. smooth creamy ice cream. the cone is crispy and slightly chewy. they give a generous amount of ice cream too. good value for 4. plus you can get a nice photo. they also sell a variety of chinese style bake goods.,5,Bake 麵包屋

"great food, especially the nutella fish shaped pancakes",5,Bake 麵包屋
"very old school chinese baked goods - tbh theyre probably a bit niche for most westerners, but i love their chicken floss buns and other assorted goodies such as light as air padan rolls. put them on a tray and then take them to the counter to pay and have them wrapped, or youll be told off.",5,Bake 麵包屋
"bake is a popular shop with ice cream, genuine chinese fresh baked goods (these are at a reasonable price). the staff is efficient and works fast. they sell the hyped matcha flavoured icy creamy goodness in an japanese taiyaki. it's good but as is with most hypes - overpriced.",4,Bake 麵包屋
"don't know about the buns, the ice cream was nice, the cake not so much.",4,Bake 麵包屋
nice ice cream. you can have it in two flavors; vanilla  or green tea.,4,Bake 麵包屋

fresh taiyaki made on site with choice of ice creams and fillings. also a good range of chinese pastries.,5,Bake 麵包屋
vanilla flavour was yummy and that fish shaped cone made it much more interesting.,4,Bake 麵包屋
"i got the green tea ice cream. beautiful presentation, flavor was a bit lacking (couldn't really taste the green tea/matcha), but the fish pastry was delicious. i got some buns last time and they were pretty soft and fresh.",4,Bake 麵包屋
"tea time,supreme. pastries, apple pie, choc fudge exquisite.we enjoy it !one more time. .",5,Bake 麵包屋
"fun asian bakery. lots of fun options at affordable prices. there's a slight language barrier which makes their customer service seem lacking. i thought the fish ice cream thing was gonna be a total gimmick (that i wanted to be a park of nevertheless), but turns out the green tea soft serve was quite tastey.",5,Bake 麵包屋
"amazing food , especially the pandan cake and ice cream. extremely helpful and will continue to go in the future",5,Bake 麵包屋
lovely soft bread filled with cream and sprinkled with coconut. light as a cloud and very yummy. will certainly be back for more  ,5,Bake 麵包屋
the food is nice. but the customer service is the worst! the woman who serves the ice cream was so nice! dont get me wrong. but the two people at the till. extremely rude and i have been thee twice. same person and same service from her. if you are ok with having nice food but rubbish service. this is the place for you.,1,Bake 麵包屋
"we were too full to try anything more then the green tea ice-cream. the gimmick of the fish is very cool, and tasty. the ice-cream is not too sweet, perfectly balanced. loved it, and would definitely try other things on my next visit.",5,Bake 麵包屋
small take-away asian bakery. loved the small fish shaped pasty that is lightly stuffed with custard.,4,Bake 麵包屋

yummy! definitely worth the wait,3,Bake 麵包屋
the egg custards were very delicious. we also bought pineapple flavored bread etc. they were all good.,4,Bake 麵包屋
"i don't even wanna give them 1star. the worst customer service ever.. (maybe the lady who i talked with was just really bad, and not rest of employees.) i don't usually write bad reviews, but this place was unbelievable. thank you for ruining my first london trip! i will never go back.",1,Bake 麵包屋
love the pistachio ice cream that comes in a fish waffle cone.,5,Bake 麵包屋
"got ripped off. clearly stated 'smallest, cheapest green tea possible'. got suspicious when they asked for receipt and didn't want to give it back. 2nd star for tea ice creme taste.",2,Bake 麵包屋
taiyaki  so delicious !! try it out,5,Bake 麵包屋
"it's one of the few authentic shops around leicester square. you can find a wide range of freshly baked products. it is always crowded, and you can't expect much of service, but you can help yourself with peace of mind through a self-service scheme.",5,Bake 麵包屋
so-so. nothing all that special. their soft served ice cream tastes no different than something you can find easily at mcdonalds. just tastes sweet and no other flavour. buns are alright.,3,Bake 麵包屋

"really disappointed, the food has no taste and the waiters were really rude.",2,Beijing Dumpling
"we've been here a couple of times and the quality varies but this was the worst of the worst. zero szechuan in the szechuan chicken, rubbery squid and dried out crusty xiao long bao. i've had better food and service in a mall food court.",1,Beijing Dumpling
"shocking service, food that we did get was mediocre, bizarrely there was a queue at the door, this place sucks, don't go.",1,Beijing Dumpling
disappointing - mediocre xiaolongbao soup dumplings (we tried three kinds) and a zha jiang noodles that had a sauce that was watery. prices were ok and service was fine.,3,Beijing Dumpling
"great dumplings, made on site! fast service and at a good price. definitely worth a visit!",4,Beijing Dumpling

very good dim sum for a reasonable price. they also serve a lot of other chinese dishes. just be prepared to wait for a table.,5,Beijing Dumpling

best pork fried dumplings i've ever had! they even made tofo taste good.,5,Beijing Dumpling
"a star for the location and atmosphere. i have no clue to why they have a michelin sticker. the personal is rude.the dumplings are chewy. when served in soup, the soup was just boiled water, no broth or anything.go to the thames southbank streetfood market, their dumplings are incomparably better.",1,Beijing Dumpling

unbelievably brilliant dessert concept. where's this been all my life?,5,Bubblewrap Waffle

"great ice creams. i had tried more than a couple of time to have one, but for different reasons i wasnt able to. finally i had the opportunity and it was worth it. dont be afraid of the long line, you wouldnt regret the waiting time.",5,Bubblewrap Waffle
amazing waffles but the store is tiny and there's hardly any space to stand and wait for your order as it gets very busy.,4,Bubblewrap Waffle

bubblewrap pop delightful treat. will definitely return,5,Bubblewrap Waffle
if you don't mind paying a lot of money for a desert then the bubblewrap is for you (and all the tourists of chinatown). the bubblewraps themselves are made fresh but the ice cream is not that great - it's the style you'd get in a 100l tub from tesco.,3,Bubblewrap Waffle
very good place for dessert. lots of different mix and match options as can make your own combination. also have vegan options which is good as many ice cream places don't cater for this. can be quite a wait to be served and it's also quite a small and narrow shop so can be quite a squeeze.,5,Bubblewrap Waffle
"loved every bite! great concept, good quality ice cream...yummy toppings!",5,Bubblewrap Waffle
"who wouldnt love a fresh waffle hugging heavenly treats like oreos, kitkats, gelato, and nutella drizzle? yes, the line can be long, but its worth the wait.",4,Bubblewrap Waffle

"queue can get quite long, especially at busy times, but the bubble waffle is delicious. would recommend.",5,Bubblewrap Waffle
"""nut feast with matcha waffle"": the very flavorful matcha waffle is crusty on the outside but soft and melty in the middle; well matched with quality hazelnut gelato topped with a decent portion of hazelnuts - no cheating. will definitely return to try other flavors.",5,Bubblewrap Waffle
"ok, it's good, but not heavenly. i wish the waffle was warm.the waiting line is absurd, come early.",4,Bubblewrap Waffle
i like waffles and i like ice cream.....what more could i ask for in a venue !,4,Bubblewrap Waffle
top waffles 10/10 would recommend (already brought all my friends).,5,Bubblewrap Waffle
so yummy ,5,Bubblewrap Waffle
definitely you must try it if you visit london!the only thing is that probably you'll have to wait about half an hour because the place is quite small and there are a lot of people waiting outside.,4,Bubblewrap Waffle
product's are good and tasty but at the same time is a bit too exspensive for so little ice cream that u get.,4,Bubblewrap Waffle
"the bubbles are awesome, but i had ice cream on top, which kind of screws it. the area is very busy in the middle of china town, and there is no place to sit, just standing in the rain outside",4,Bubblewrap Waffle
"really tasty, and a good price (between 5-8) don't be put off by the queue, it moves quite fast!",5,Bubblewrap Waffle
you gotta go here. it's like a fun crepe with bubbles and amazing icecream!,5,Bubblewrap Waffle
"delicious bubble waffle - we tried vanilla crunchy one :). but it is quite expensive - 7,5",4,Bubblewrap Waffle
firs time i try a bubblewaffle.i ordered the oreo crunchy caramel cheesecake. the waffle itself was thin and delicious. i contained a ball of cheesecake icecream topped with caramel and 4 oreo cookies.just delicious.,5,Bubblewrap Waffle
a bit disappointing to be honest. not much better than an average stall you'd find anywhere and triple the price.,2,Bubblewrap Waffle
excellent waffles and quality ingredients.,5,Bubblewrap Waffle
"great bubble waffle, nice dessert to share",5,Bubblewrap Waffle
delicious waffles and beautiful presentation of food. definitely a must try in china town. don't let the long queues to scare you off.,5,Bubblewrap Waffle

so delicious hong kong waffle. definitely buy it again.,5,Bubblewrap Waffle
"so, so good! definitely recommend.",5,Bubblewrap Waffle
loved the bubble waffle cone but the ice cream itself was just standard ice cream and so you're definitely just paying for the novelty of a fluffy waffle cone than any of the ingredients. instagram worthy and hip and as such a long line no matter that it was a rather chilly day even by london standards. one time stop for me.,4,Bubblewrap Waffle
i loved it but the wrap could have been crispy.,4,Bubblewrap Waffle
"love this place, there is sometimes a queue out the door, but it is worth the wait! lovely to see an independent place thrive in an increasingly chain filled city!",5,Bubblewrap Waffle
my girl had one and loved it!!! ,5,Bubblewrap Waffle
"great waffles with a bunch of options, they have something for every palate. the only downside is the line that is out the door, about a 20 minute wait to get your waffle.",4,Bubblewrap Waffle
very pretty waffles (instagram worthy) but not as tasty as i would have hoped.,3,Bubblewrap Waffle
it tasted as good as it looks. a must try.,5,Bubblewrap Waffle

unique and tasty however rather expensive (5-6 pounds per dessert),5,Bubblewrap Waffle

"the icecream was delicious, i'd like a little more of strawberries but was delicious!",5,Bubblewrap Waffle
"not highly priced,  their bubble wrap waffle is so tasty",5,Bubblewrap Waffle
"lined up for 30 minutes.  they need to improve their work flow to service customers quicker.  the waffles with an air pocket was a nice gimmick and makes it lighter than it looks.  ice cream was just ok.  thought it was too expensive, even for london.  the waffle tasted fresh but was just ok.  this gimmick will wear off soon.",3,Bubblewrap Waffle
delicious waffles ,5,Bubblewrap Waffle
fun and really tasty!,5,Bubblewrap Waffle
omg so good.  staff were friendly the bubblewrap was sooooo good,5,Bubblewrap Waffle
would definitely give zero if i can. the egg waffle is soggy and the vanilla ice cream has a weird plastic taste..please dont waste your money and time on this,1,Bubblewrap Waffle
extremely busy and there's always a long queue but the waffle and ice cream tastes great.,4,Bubblewrap Waffle
waffles are really tasty but not sure if worth the wait,4,Bubblewrap Waffle
"great for a treat. the toppings are expensive considering the serving offered (it's trendy, and that's what you're paying for) but everything is fresh, and the dark chocolate ice-cream was delicious.there was a 15 minutes wait but the staff is incredibly fast.",5,Bubblewrap Waffle
"there is usually a long queue, but totally worth the wait. at least you have enough time to decide which amazing ice cream flavours and toppings you want and change your mind 3 times. the waffle is always freshly made and tastes amazing ",5,Bubblewrap Waffle
very cool and fun waffles,5,Bubblewrap Waffle
"not that great and way overpriced. the size of this dessert is huge. but they put one little scoop of gelato in a very big cone. the waffle bubble wrap cone was quite dry and tasteless but the gelato was good. its a tourist area, what do you expect.",2,Bubblewrap Waffle
something different that you need to taste. the ice cream was very good.,5,Bubblewrap Waffle

"great dumplings, fair price. and don't miss the little chinese fresh pancake stall round the corner on the side street, also belonging to the same place.",5,Bun House
"excellent, just a shame there isn't more seating for larger groups.",5,Bun House
the place is very small and we had to wait around 15/20 minutes to sit down. later we ordered (the food is very quick to make) and we had to eat so fast because a lot of people were waiting to seat and they continued to ask us if we were finishing so they could reserve the table. that has been a bit upsetting.,3,Bun House

simple but nice. like chicken liver bao. :xxx and soya milk,5,Bun House
expensive and the drinks are disgusting,2,Bun House
"best bun ever had! given the taste of the buns, paying around two pound for each bun is more than reasonable! moreover, each bun is pretty large and really satisfying. can't expect more from 2 pound!",5,Bun House

custard buns are best in london. also try the curried fish balls and the pork bao you'll not be disappointed,4,Bun House
food in soho (especially on the go-ho (geddit?)) can be hit-and-miss. but bun house always delivers the goods. the dumplings are delicious. faces light up after the first bite. i suggest ordering the less conventional side-dishes: tripe and fish balls.,5,Bun House

quick service and great food.,4,Bun House
pig bun is delicious!,5,Bun House

very nice buns but expensive for the size :( 2.50 for one which is roughly the size of a cupcake instead of the muffin sized ones you can get round the corner.,3,Bun House
nice buns very fluffy  and nice filling but that's it. the tea and the other food are just average very over priced for what you get...i did not go downstairs for the other menu so can't comment about that side otherwise the bun are  worth a try but i don't think i be back in the near future.........,4,Bun House
beef rice was very tasty,5,Bun House
"delicious buns. i would recommend the pork, lamb and custard buns and a chili tripe and fried cheung fan for the sides.minus two stars off as even though i like this place, the last time we were here it took them 30 mins to make the tripe and cheung fan. no apologies at all.",3,Bun House

"delicious and affordable, but queues are ridiculously long sometimes",4,Bun House
amazing restaurant with lovely outdoor seating! the staff are very pleasant and food is top notch! not to mention the price which is simply unbelievable considering the location and the food quality. they also serve imported drinks such as the soy milk from hong kong which i will recommend.,5,Bun House
really nice loved it,5,Bun House
"being so close to china town its hard to beat the meat bun options available a few minutes away.  however, the dessert buns were really good.  if you're passing by and in need of a sweet treat the custard bun and red chocolate bun are worth the money.next time though i think i'll try the tea room downstairs",3,Bun House
"very quaint little spot. really enjoyed the food - nothing fancy but delicious. would recommend for a low-fuss, speedy meal.",5,Bun House
"the male chinese server here is rude to asian or chinese customer in compares to caucasian ones, it feels targeted. dont come to this place if youre chinese, despite that it is an chinese restaurant, they rather have white customer lol",1,Bun House

good menu but not to vegetarians,3,Bun House
"delicious, hot, and perfectly spiced. i am perpetually on a quest for the best bao--an honorable journey of eating my way through three continents of meats and sweets in bun form. bun house is up there. they have my stomach, heart, and loyalty as the bao-bassadors of london.",5,Bun House

what a taste on such a small piece of steam bun!,5,Bun House

wooden furniture giving the place an authentic asian look. great spicy noodles and great bao.,4,Bun House
amazing buns look out for the custard and the brioche like bun they are ,5,Bun House
"this shop actually exceeded my expectations in terms of taste! the curry fish balls and the smashed cucumbers (pretty spicy though) were excellent! the buns themselves were alright, and all in all it was good value in my opinion for the price you pay.",4,Bun House
"affordable, nice location i go there when i want to try something new and nice",5,Bun House
good place for a quick snack. buns were fluffy but the ones with meat didn't have as much filling as i wanted. the egg yolk one was the best though. super messy and delicious.  milk tea was really pricey for just a small cup. but it did taste nice. overall good enough if you were in the area and wanted a snack etc.,3,Bun House
"excellent and authentic food, tried all of the dim sum and the flavours and quality was on point. definitely would come back again.",5,Bun House
"recommended! they do absolutely fantastic custard bun, must try, the custard filling will flow out when you take a bite! their shrimp dumpling is also very tasty!",5,Bun House

nice little place. the custard bun is nice. the wings are crispy. definitely want to come back to try more buns.,5,Bun House
"the food is really good, especially the buns. the setting is also really nice, but very dirty which made me uncomfortable. the tables and dishes are well kept, but a better cleaning of the seatings should be made. the service is good though!",3,Bun House
"simply, and consistently, the best bao buns in town. i have a preference for their tripe as well, it's delicious, but the rest of the menu is full of great choices, you can't go wrong with this establishment.kudos to the team as well, no matter how busy it gets they're always cheerful and very polite.",5,Bun House
so damn tasty! will be back,5,Bun House
easy on the menu and easy on the wallet. good amount of choices with comfy happy service. it can get a bit busy at times but it's worth a wait if you must. a bit touristy yet good reliable choice.,5,Bun House
great interior and good quality buns.,5,Bun House
"had to wait over half an hour with no other customers in. ordered beef with rice, beef was too greasy and too tough to chew on, rice was overcoocked. bad experience, never again",1,Bun House
nice steamed buns and fish curry balls. quickly served and reasonably priced at 2.50 a bun. need 3 for lunch. very casual. would be 4* but its a bit lifeless and squashed,3,Bun House
awesome thick fried noodles with amazing spices .. best i ever had. matched with a really tasty rice wine!,5,Bun House
"flavours (except the winter special mulled wine) were good and good for quick eat. probably because it was breezy restaurant, the buns came out little cold though. curried fish balls were cooked well and may be my favourite.",3,Bun House
"i had there just one dish, i think pork dim sam in soup which was good and descent price. there is always a queue there so i can imagine the other dishes are good as well.",5,Bun House
"bao addiction is a disease. here, the pig bao transports you through seven levels of umami and the duck egg yolk 'custard' bun basically comes from another dimension. my counsellor will be sending you the bill forthwith.",5,Bun House
"sooo good! so much flavour, buns are wonderfully fluffy and excellent vibe. ho fun is a must try.",5,Bun House
"the pork and veggie were delicious. so was the cucumber salad.the chicken bun was a bit dissapointing (it has liver in it). also, the beer was warm...",4,Bun House
"really cheap, lovely food and a great location.",5,Bun House
"great food, simple and delicious menu, great decor too!",5,Bun House
the buns were lovely and the music and decor made me nolstagic! the only thing is that i found the ordering and picking up process slightly chaotic during busy hours.,4,Bun House
lamb and mustard bun tastes great! typical cantonese type of buns and not the same as the way northern china cook buns ,4,Bun House
food is absolutely incredible and really good value for money! service is fast and friendly! i always make sure i drop in if i'm nearby even if i'm not hungry!,5,Bun House
"great value, great food!",5,Bun House

"perfectly cooked steam buns for only 2.50. good selection of fillings with the lamb and fish being highlights. quick service with options to eat in, albeit with not much space, or to takeaway.",5,Bun House
never disappointed! hole in the wall but love this place and all it has to offer.,5,Bun House

the pork brisket was good but servings are small for the price. the steam buns are also on the small side. we thought it was just a pay and lock up but one of our buns took almost 30 minutes.,3,Bun House
this place is great! best buns in london,5,Bun House
simply tasty!! 2.50 for those tasty buns is such a bargain!! the fillings are nicely spiced and the bun is just so fluffy,5,Bun House
"the food is really good! the menu is quite limited, and the seating space is a bit small. i would definitely recommend!",5,Bun House
"food and environment are good. everything served like take away, paper bag, disposable bowl, order and collect by yourself. staff really really impolite and impatient.",2,Bun House
"buns and garlic chicken wings tasted good, especially beef bun. caf is like self-service (you come, order and pick up your order) and it has 6 small tables.",5,Bun House
"early dinner, simple, good and quick. had three dumplings (pork 2x + vegetables) as well as excellent cow tripes with black bean and coriander - which is enough. it is a very simple place - more of a (good) snack",4,Bun House
the staffs are friendly and the food are nice!,5,Bun House

"nice buns, open late ",5,Bun House
cool little place off the main street. maybe a little pricey but food was very tasty and very fresh. had the pork bao and the rice noodle rolls (a first for me) - cheung fun. choose and order at the front desk; collect when ready from the back bar. good lunch stop.,4,Bun House

"delicious buns, cucumber and great curried fish balls. eat in the very pretty tiled room or take out.only thing we were less into was the salted soda - it was diet. tea probably a better bet.",5,Bun House

good food and cool atmosphere upstairs,4,Bun House
"a small place making chinese steamed buns. they are tasty, albeit smallish at 2.50. we had the lamb, pork, vegetable, custard, beef and fish buns. all were good. the custard one is made with salted duck eggs, but tastes like normal custard more or less.",4,Bun House

"fantastic quality and great price.highlights for me are the custard bun and mantau which are as good as i've had in taiwan. bo lo yao bao was unfortunately a bit poor so avoid that but everything else on the menu is excellent.if you were umming and ahhing about the trip, just get it. also fantastic.",5,Bun House

"laksa is incredible, go now...",5,C & R Cafe Restaurant
"very poor. beef rendang was microwaved, food was hot on the outside and cold in the inside - how old was this beef rendang?  neither was it good value at 10 for 4 small peices of beef.  rest of the food was mediocre, surprisingly for its location in central london.   better malaysian food elsewhere.",1,C & R Cafe Restaurant
there may be a wait and a line ride at popular times but it is worth it. the food is delicious. good singapore laksa and the nasi gorang also yummy. yes it is busy and yes expect that your dishes may not all come out at the same time but that's part of it and the focus is on the food.,5,C & R Cafe Restaurant
always yummy and bustling.,5,C & R Cafe Restaurant
"reasonable price and very delicious malaysian food. the shop is in chinatown but in a small quite corner, away from all the noisy tourists. ",4,C & R Cafe Restaurant

the best singapore laksa in london ,5,C & R Cafe Restaurant
a good place to enjoy malaysian food. a bit disappointed my hainanese chicken rice was dry and the rice not too flavoursome. the laksa was much better with a richer sauce,4,C & R Cafe Restaurant

best in town. not keen one one dish ( first time in c&r) kind enough to give me a 2nd dish choice on the house....which was delicious ,4,C & R Cafe Restaurant
food was greasy and discovered after my visit the restaurant only has a 1 out 5 hygiene rating!,1,C & R Cafe Restaurant
well priced and tasty,4,C & R Cafe Restaurant
"i had the hainanese chicken with rice but there was almost no flavour with the chicken and the chili sauce tasted odd. although the plum and lime drink tasted really good!

"crc is hidden down an alleyway in soho china town uk. close to the new gates. i was pleasantly surprised by them, the food and service were great. if you're with a big group they can move their tables around to accommodate you.",4,C & R Cafe Restaurant
"though it was a little difficult to find, it is very much worth the visit. the chicken and beef is halal here. the service was prompt, the wait staff friendly and engaging. the venue is well lit and spaced out nicely for the small space. the cafe has a nice and relaxed atmosphere too.",5,C & R Cafe Restaurant
malaysian restaurant in a little alleyway in chinatown. make sure you turn up with your whole group as they wont seat you. noodle soup dishes are huge!  made the mistake of ordering satay as well which was far too much. tasty.,4,C & R Cafe Restaurant

nice malaysian or singapore restaurant.,4,C & R Cafe Restaurant
"food was alright, it was nice but not life changing. service was poor (but kind of expected). prices are a bit steep for what you get but i suppose it's in chinatown. the menu photos on google are deceiving and must be from a while ago as the noodle soups are now 9-10 rather than 7-8.",3,C & R Cafe Restaurant
"lamb curry, always a good choice",4,C & R Cafe Restaurant
yes! don't tell anyone about this place if you have been there! it's mine!,5,C & R Cafe Restaurant

"a little gem hidden near chinatown. great food, fast service",5,C & R Cafe Restaurant
"i felt they are not as good as 2 years ago... please ask staff for chopped green pepper, it's one of the sauce/spice they offered for customers, that's the most amazing thing. add some into your food then upgrade to another level. the staff that serve us  is quite rude, that's another reason i only gave 3 stars.",3,C & R Cafe Restaurant
awful customer service!! extremely rude waitress who overcharged us and told us to eat faster so other customers could come in. we had only been there 25 minutes. wont be back.,1,C & R Cafe Restaurant

"this place was a-okay. my singaporean laksa was decent but lacking certain oomph factor - it was good but not great, something i could probably replicate easily at home with store-bought laksa paste. i may return if i am in the area and craving malay food.",3,C & R Cafe Restaurant
the laksa is a dream...,5,C & R Cafe Restaurant

awful service as presumably because my friend and i didn't order enough as we wanted their a snack and dessert at 11pm. disappointed with the food quality as well- char siu tasted flat and marinated with sugar. reasonable prices but not good enough to justify being essentially kicked out,1,Cafe TPT
one of my favorite asian restaurants in london. authentic and delicious dishes. just keep in mind that the place is really small.,5,Cafe TPT

the store is gorgeous with a lot of potential but there is such a lack of system on the service. the staff completely ignores the customers as well as potential customers that come in waiting to be seated. nobody approaches them and the coffee n cakes takes take ages to be served. tables stay dirty for long before picked up.shame,1,Caffe Concerto - Shaftesbury Avenue

"i though if a place charges you 20 on the entrance as a standard price- it must be worth it. could be more mistaken. the place is small much smaller than it appears on the pictures, full of doggy people (the night when we went there). just a gin mill. do not recomend it if you value your money.",1,Café de Paris

awful place. lined up to get in and they wouldn't let us in because the bouncers said they were not letting anymore males in the club. so we left but we noticed they were letting plenty of other males in. don't waste your time and energy coming here especially if there's black people in your group. racist horrible place,1,Café de Paris
we have had the pleasure of creating events at this venue and going as guests and both experiences were fab! we had recently created a party for the telegraph where we built a scare attraction around the top half of the venue. it was a great night and we shall look forward to working here again and creating parties for our clients.,5,Café de Paris
"visited for a xmas party with my company. good impression. venue is not massive, but scenic and cosy.",4,Café de Paris
"was  a pity that not food allowed to be served with general admission. expensive admission fees having in consideration the prices for drinks. we came by 7 pm following their recommendation and show started 8:30 pm , so it became bit long waiting for us with not food. til 8 they have happy hour whats good.",3,Café de Paris

the toilets were horrible. skanky,1,Café de Paris
it was okay. okay is the best i can say. service was quite good. but the food was average. the show was intermittent and throughout about 2 hours. i expected something more entertaining and more continuous. i dont think i would come back or recommend it to friends...,3,Café de Paris

first time there and it satisfies my curiosity. will definitely go again. the entertainment was amazing. the music had me on the dancefloor most of the night. but the toilets are small for the crowd capacity.,4,Café de Paris
the show is amazing!  that's what you go for.  the food is just meh.  and it's supposed to be a disco club? but the music changed to hip-hop after the show and we lost interest. but the show was still specular!!,4,Café de Paris
great night out. love the disco and cabaret.,5,Café de Paris
"they rejected us because we were foreign, we're australian.",1,Café de Paris

"caf de paris is an extraordinarily entertaining place, the acts are great, food is surprisingly delicious, the service is great, waiters are actually well attentive which is usually not the case with venues of this category. its classy, the cocktails and drinks are a little bit pricey but given the location its justifiable.",4,Café de Paris
had such a lovely time celebrating my 25th birthday at cafe de paris! the staff were very attentive and the venue had such a fun atmosphere. highly recommended!,5,Café de Paris
"the show was just wow. super quirky, funny, entertaining.",5,Café de Paris
drink prices overrated entertainment music vibes dry better entertainment right outside,2,Café de Paris
never again. i am very confused as to how they have remained opened this long.  i can relate to many of the negative experiences shared here. rude and beyond disrespectful door-staff.  do not care to give money to a locale that has no respect for their patrons.,1,Café de Paris
had such a great night good service and the door staff are friendly enough music was great too loads of old school tunes,5,Café de Paris
first time i was at cafe de paris from the suggestion of alex from club bookers. and i was not disappointed. the place was amazing! a bit pricy but other than that everything was great. book through alex as he will take care of everything! thanks alex ,4,Café de Paris
saw the saturday night cabaret show. awesome acts and the mc was brilliant. beautiful club - highly recommended. arrive around 7pm if you are not having the dinner as you'll be sitting in the balcony and some seats don't have a good view of the stage.,5,Café de Paris
poor choice of beer for such an expensive place. decor doesn't make up for the miserable staff.,2,Café de Paris
gooooood one,5,Café de Paris
"horrible security (entire team), unreasonable and rude. bars were alright but drinks overpriced. no experience handling a crowd and absolutlely wrong way to handle vip and customers who have paid for tables. waste of a prime location and venue, please change the management and security :)",1,Café de Paris
they are very rude and humiliating.. they says only we need women . we need a ticket but they didnt accept us.. this was the funniest thing i've ever heard in my life... we need a women hahahshsh.. they are stupid.. dont go there never... :))),1,Café de Paris
good function event venue  no parking as usual w1,5,Café de Paris
"the club is awesome. the dj this friday was boring. instead of playing something fun and easy to dance to, he played smth really heavy and depressing. such a shame",1,Café de Paris
great night entertainment was amazing staff very friendly recommend to anyone,5,Café de Paris
an experience that shouldn't be missed! when visiting london reserve your table looooooong before your trip as spaces disappear very very quickly!!,5,Café de Paris
"small place with not a very reasonable price on drinks and entry tickets. plus, the bouncers/ security guards are awful to say the least",1,Café de Paris
ignore the 1 star rating as i am trying to remove the review that i left. this is the best i could do. at this point in time i was wrong to leave the review that i did and give the venue a 1 star rating. unfortunately i can not take down/completely remove the original post do this edot will have to do!,1,Café de Paris

"it is a really lovely spot, offering fantastic coffees and goodies like blueberry pancakes. definitely a great non-chain cafe.",4,Café de Paris
"anywhere that uses discriminatory behaviour  deserves no stars at all, it's the 21st century not the dark ages. overpriced and charge for using card, door keeper charges entrants what he feels like, the manager should have been paying us as he was worthless... let me know when you develop past the dark ages.",1,Café de Paris
"had our staff christmas party here, terrible venue! appalling service and staff, rude and unhelpful",1,Café de Paris
"awesome music, both electronic and hip hop. the vip section is very comfortable and overlooks the dance floor. had a lot of fun there with my girls.",5,Café de Paris
"show was awesome but the second it ended we were hurded like cattle and forced to pour our drinks in a plastic glass and move on. it was a horrible sudden experience to a lovely evening & show. soon after the place took a dive and turned into a ""cheap"" nightclub and that was the end of our evening. but the show was amazing.",1,Café de Paris
the people of the security decided that a friend of mine was drunk without any criterion. rude and unpolite staff. never again. go anywhere else or stay at home. worst people ever.,1,Café de Paris

really rude woman working there. asked a question and she started shouting to someone else in a different language and when she saw in still there waiting for an answer she started yelling at me is not her problem. luckily a few overpriced drinks later it wasn't so bad... will not be coming back ever,1,Café de Paris
"the general seating area is horribly oversold, and the staff is both rude and constantly changing positions on where we were allowed to stand. we were constantly moved between places with gradually declining field of view until we couldn't see a thing. can't believe we paid for this horrendous experience. avoid at all cost.",1,Café de Paris
"great show and food. the bouncers wouldn't let me back in after leaving for a cigarette. my coat was still in the cloak room so i then asked if i could go get it and they called me a ""liar"". luckily i had my cloak room ticket on me. ruined my night",3,Café de Paris
"although the caf is not completely accessible(not suitable for wheelchair users) i was welcomed at the door, i expedited through the entry process, escorted to my seat & staff constantly enquired as to whether i required any extra halp. very enjoyable afternoon.  definitely come again",5,Café de Paris
brilliant night out,5,Café de Paris
"if there was option for no star would have chosen it... absolutely discusting place! rip off entry and you get complete charade... overcrouded, waiting more then half an hour for drinks rude waiters no show worse nye everwarning do not waste your time and money going there!",1,Café de Paris
"5 stars for the nightclub decor. despite some reviews the staff was polite. the crowd was a mix and a bit rowdy, would give 3 stars for that",4,Café de Paris

"great night, great venue. back again soon!",5,Café de Paris
"i would give less if i could.paid 50 for the new years entrance.no entertainment, songs were 5-10 years old!, it seemed like a normal night out, no indication that it actually was a new years eve.thank you for ruining my night, if i could turn back time, i would just stayed at home!",1,Café de Paris
had an amazing halloween in cafe de paris. thank you all,5,Café de Paris
"i really liked cafe de paris, it is always a great party and great place to relax and enjoying london nights.",5,Café de Paris
"from pictures i had impression that this is posh club, but it's nothing like that. one tiny, dirty toilet with super long queue, crappy dance area in basement, rude security, staff treats you like - pay and f* off, high prices. definitely not worth it.",1,Café de Paris
amazing place !!!,5,Café de Paris
"if i could give this place no stars i would. terrible service from alex/sonny who were selling me dreams about what i would get once me and my friends arrive at the venue for my birthday party. absolutely trash should of just gone tiger tiger instead, avoid this unpleasant and unprofessional experience i had to deal with.",1,Café de Paris
a place trying to be posh but ends up being flat and boring. also very overpriced. staff very nice and friendly though.,2,Café de Paris
loved it! can't wait to go back! booked with london night guides. highly recommend,5,Café de Paris
"indecent, arrogant and aggressive security staff. total rip-off when buying drinks. bouncers without any decency.not worth a visit, only good for losing a few 1000  !",1,Café de Paris
great burlesque show.,5,Café de Paris
this place is a racist institution. they love to threaten people. i was taken to a random backdoor place and not allowed to leave albeit regurtitating my rights as a human being. i am going to call the police. best believe that.,1,Café de Paris
great place for private party,5,Café de Paris
"great westend entertainment! cabaret, fire acts, comedy... lots going on",5,Café de Paris
we seem to be another group that experienced 'attitude' from the bouncers.put a real damper on the evening - especially as ot was a friend's birthday.cannot honestly recommend.,2,Café de Paris
smart dress a very famous venue cafe de paris some great parties hope you can dance,5,Café de Paris
"attempts to label itself as one of london's finest clubs and it indeed tries to charge you as such. they tend to hold back the ""better"" looking girls in the queue disregarding the weather as to attempt to lure in drunk males in way that you could only describe as objectifying.rude, arrogant and utterly unenjoyable.",2,Café de Paris
the best place for a paris styled vibe in the centre of london,5,Café de Paris
"awful drinks, bad dj huge cover charge (20). table service not existent. can not recommend this. ",1,Café de Paris
"got the vibe,  could be good...  but just another club that offers the same thing and act like theyre fancy.  you are also charged an extra 3 pounds if you pay by card at the bar. just a rip-off.  dj is ok too..  nothing special and the crowd is so so",2,Café de Paris
"beautiful interior. show was ok, nothing special. barely a nipple. first come, first serve seating (unless you rsvp) so get there early to actually get a decent view.",3,Café de Paris
"highly overrated place. drinks are very expensive, is much smaller than the pictures suggest. it is existing a an anciently hyped reputation. better go to the w around the corner. dj is terrible and has no sense of what moves a crowd.",2,Café de Paris
beautiful venue. full of old world class and cabretta mystique ,4,Café de Paris
luxury exspensive,5,Café de Paris

"i came to this club randomly, being in central .. i guess the location made up for the prices. it picked up around 12am when the rnb etc came on. the security need to relax a little and i don't think i'll be buying drinks there haha. i'll come again and the inside is beautiful.",4,Café de Paris
stunning setting. amazing artists. wonderful show. great experience.,5,Café de Paris
my first experience at caf de paris left much to be desired i returned after being assured this was a once off and my second experience was brilliant. ,4,Café de Paris

"very good experience, super fun and really enjoyed it. nick in particular was very accommodating and super helpful. definitely will be returning!",5,Café de Paris
went on saturday and i had a really good night. if go almost monthly and the staff are always very warm and friendly. the show always lives up to expectations. this is one of the finest places to spend your saturday night in the west end,5,Café de Paris
oh what an experience.i enjoyed it very much. l went on my own through a meet up group.there was the awesome cabaret which started at 8:30 and ended at 10then the place was turned into a club. under a minute walk from the piccadilly circus,5,Café de Paris
lovely staff. nice interior. great music. fabulous performance. buzzing and electrifying environment. highly recommended,5,Café de Paris
my fiance and i visited cafe de paris in early december 2019 for their three course dinner and cabaret evening. the food was delicious and the cabaret was excellent. the acts were of an incredibly high standard with a brilliant and hilarious host. we can't wait to visit again with friends!,5,Café de Paris
"ive honestly never been so well treated . as a wheelchair user i was treated and looked after so well, better than any other bar or club ive ever visited by far! staff were amazing and treated us amazingly well! will recommend this place to anyone , any time",5,Café de Paris

perfect for an event,5,Café de Paris
each time i am there it's such a rush! keep up the good work you guys! :)),5,Café de Paris
very bad security unhelpful manager ruined our night,1,Café de Paris
"had a private party and they did a really good job, the food was great",4,Café de Paris
"racism, after having bought 2 bottles with my friends, they threw us out for being romanian, nothing else, in that club we do not admit romanians bulgaros or ungaros, it's shameful",1,Café de Paris
"a fantastic new take on the old cafe de paris. the disco54 launch was one of the best nights i've had in london in so long, bringing together the best of immersive performance and great music. can't wait to get back under the discoball.",5,Café de Paris
"woeful, turned away because we werent women? sexist, rude and petiful excuse for a bar.",1,Café de Paris
"went for a private party, lovely venue but i can't really comment on anything else",3,Café de Paris
loved the burlesque  show great entertainment laughed hard and often,5,Café de Paris
"the sort of club you go to if you're from outside london and you've heard this place is good. it's like a big essex nightclub - tacky. no edge, nothing interesting happening.",2,Café de Paris
"what am amazing night!!! booked here for our work summer party, we all arrange from different ages and we all had such amazing time. drinks are a bit expensive. ",5,Café de Paris
ridiculous expensive drinks,1,Café de Paris
nice place for a saturday night although may be hhard to get in if you come after 10pm. beautiful interior especially chandelier. good fun for clubbing. ,4,Café de Paris
"worst night of my life. bouncers are rude. the club is dead. a shot costs 7. ended up leaving the club at 12. go to zoo just around the corner, defo reccomend.",1,Café de Paris
the dj changes songs just when it gets good frequently. but it is still a pretty place and the dress code is not so strict although everyone does dress to the nines there,3,Café de Paris
absolutely a must go! great show. watch the drinks bill though. ,4,Café de Paris
"decent club, prices were pretty dear but music was good",5,Café de Paris
"it's a nice venue, food not what i expected but still had a great time here.",3,Café de Paris
an excellent evening of entertainment - the show was superb and the waitress was very attentive. food was delicious.  a fabulous night out - would highly recommend.,4,Café de Paris
beautifully glamorous place that requires a dress code. the dress code of overly insecure guys who think they can get laid with girls that just want to drink and have a bit of fun. staff is really nice and the architecture is beautiful..with all the money spent on glamour there is little budget left to hire good dj's. ,2,Café de Paris
"caf de paris is an atypical club, it looks like a cabaret and the atmosphere is great! i went on a saturday night with friends, we book a table through luxguestlist and we were treated like vips. performers enliven the party and the atmosphere becomes hot. i highly recommend it :)",4,Café de Paris
"expensive, bad persons, bad idea to go there and have some drinks.",1,Café de Paris
over priced drinks. one toilet. definitely not going back.,2,Café de Paris
"cdp london far exceeded our expectations! sevens sins is magnificent! thank you to keith and the entire professional, attentive, polite  and bubbly team. a magnificent evening, surpassing value for money.",5,Café de Paris
"promoters approach groups saying they will give you free drinks. once you pay 20 pounds, drinks never arrive to table and they move you to vip like they are making you a favour. once you are there the drink was not even vodka, tasted like water with orange juice. then they get more people to the downstairs area and so on.",1,Café de Paris
nice place but i hope the staff would be more friendly.,3,Café de Paris
always have a great time at cafe de paris thanks to my promotor mia. he really takes care of us and make clubbing at cafe extra fun ,5,Café de Paris
an historic (and rather cheesey) club. see if you can access the vip room which is home to 4 or 5 beds. wonder what goes on in there!,3,Café de Paris
nice place to relax,5,Café de Paris
"rude staff, first 30 minutes we did not run, they have there that the equipment was then at the entrance to have demanded  20, when we had the vip area, drinks were cheap, coca cola was terrible, i did not like! do not go there, choose something interesting on and where staff are not rude!",2,Café de Paris
reflective of paris but not my favorite,2,Café de Paris
good place to go out. expensive but nice.,4,Café de Paris
amazing place! i crash here pretty often with the girls for a cocktail or two. plus you can meet some normal people here!,5,Café de Paris
great cabaret show on saturday nights. good food and great club night afterwards.,5,Café de Paris
awesome venue. i fell in love with it's atmosphere straight away. i want to go back or better still work there as a photographer,5,Café de Paris
"the worst place i ever been in my entire life...ive been in all club in london and i definitely think that this one is the worst one , they promote it like something big but i want give them  even 2 star ...ive read all review of other client and im disgusted .",1,Café de Paris
music was rubbish. floors were sticky. drinks were overpriced even for soho. temporary bar was even set up behind a table that night. looked very amateur. whole place needs a revamp. dont be fooled by the name and photos. ,2,Café de Paris
great place but the dj is not that good!,4,Café de Paris
"the building itself is impressive, but neither the drinks nor the service were great. the security  was straight up rude, the bartender spilled my drink, and in general, all staff members were unkind. the music was only enjoyable if you had many glasses of alcohol. considering the prices and exclusivity, it's a huge disappointment.",2,Café de Paris
"i was fortunate enough to attend a private event at this place. great space, great location.",4,Café de Paris
never go here. they took 20 each from my entire party and then refused to let us in. when we complained and asked for our money back we were physically removed from the building. complete scam with terrible staff who hate their customers.,1,Café de Paris
"great when there's live music, you're right there up close to the band",5,Café de Paris
amazing show!!,5,Café de Paris

authentic bubble tea and desserts. can get busy. good for a pit stop.,4,Candy Cafe
"great price, plentiful menu and tasty dessert. highly recommended ",5,Candy Cafe
i came here for a meet and greet experience and i was really pleased with the visit overall. i had a hazelnut latte and my friend had a strawberry smoothie and both were delicious. the music is fantastic and its very cosy. the staff are sweet and helpful and the prices are very reasonable. will definitely come again!,5,Candy Cafe
"really nice cafe tucked away in china town. i tried a bit taro milk tea with tapioca, coconut and lychee jelly...really impressed. will try some dessert next time. a bit small inside but atill a great little corner to chill and grab a drink. 5/5 for service. see you guys next time i'm in china town.",4,Candy Cafe
"perfect for a quick stop for deserts. place is very cosy and chilled! we had the bubble tea, one of the fruity house desserts, and a waffle. price is quite fair. i would definitely recommend going for a bubble tea and one of their house desserts. many choices to try from. their waffle wasnt that great.",5,Candy Cafe
ordered the shaved ice fruit bowl which was delicious and also ordered the peach crepe however it looked like it was made many hours before serving as it just didn't taste fresh nor the crepe itself hot. highly disappointed.,3,Candy Cafe
"all my favourites in the cafe, variety of tastes and styles.  in hot or cold desserts.",5,Candy Cafe
cozy place. friendly service. they have plenty of bubble teas and desserts selection. loved the watermelon one. went with friends yesterday and really had a nice time.,4,Candy Cafe
"the waffer at this place is always so good! and there are loads of other options to chose from for sweets and desserts! the cafe itself is a bit hidden, but thats what made  comfortable like secret hideout.(*`*).",5,Candy Cafe
nice deserts from hong kong,4,Candy Cafe
"yummy milk tea and dumpling sweet soup, friendly service and good location when you need a little escape from the busy streets of leicester square ad chinatown. however, i dont think customers that are paying for food and other drinks should also have to pay for tap water, especially on a hot day.",4,Candy Cafe
very friendly staff. desserts weren't too sweet. a bit overpriced.,4,Candy Cafe
absolutely awful. it was a disgusting dessert! way overpriced for such a small portion! definitely not worth going too! and the worse thing was the service charge - 1:50 extra just because we didnt buy another item?! never going back. unpleasant experience!,1,Candy Cafe
"cozy and neat little cafe. dessert are nice, staff is friendly too. maybe a bit expensive for just sweets, but the presentation does look good and the dessert/sweets are also not bad. recommended",4,Candy Cafe
tucked in one of the side streets in china town is this little beaut. it' a tiny tiny dessert restaurant but you won't be disappointed,3,Candy Cafe
very tasty and yummy...highly recommended...love it...,5,Candy Cafe
"small cafe with delicious asian desserts. you can't book, but they usually try to squeeze you in! service is friendly and quick, plenty of choice on the menu. it is a little pricey for the portion size but to be expected with the high cost of rent in china town. worth a visit, especially if you love mango desserts!",4,Candy Cafe
"small little place with lots of items on the menu. usually get a crepe and a tea. taste and priced are not bad. good for a couple friends, but like i say, it's a small place so it may be busy often.",3,Candy Cafe

"funky vibe, excellent deserts and good boba tea.",5,Candy Cafe
"i visited on a quiet evening where there were 2 or 3 groups of people, the desserts were delicious.",5,Candy Cafe
the deserts were nice and the service was fast. you can't reserve a table so go early. it is a small cafe so we had to squeeze into a small booth area. they have a tv but it was playing korean or chinese music videos. there are a lot of small stairs to climb before you get to the cafe as well.,3,Candy Cafe
"horrible service, overpriced dessert and ridiculous hidden charges (we were a party of 8 and 2 of us didn't want to order anything and they wanted to charge them 1.50 each).",1,Candy Cafe
very nice dessert here .. will go with friends next time then can eat more different dessert great service,5,Candy Cafe
"desserts are mediocre and excessively sweet, not authentic at all. they mandated a policy of one minimal order per person, despite the fact that it was 10:30pm and the place was 80% empty.as a chinese person i know my food and would recommend that you go elsewhere.",1,Candy Cafe

average. would have been like home if they had more variety. ,4,Candy Cafe
lovely staff and music and great company,5,Candy Cafe
a great honkongese desert place neatly tucked away on a small street next to chinatown. there is no fancy storefront so it is easy to miss and i have never seen it supercrowded. the desert selection is solid and moderately priced. the staff is courteous and a bit shy. ,5,Candy Cafe
"very nice place with good staff and more important, good food.only bad thing, the seats are made of wood so not comfortable long",5,Candy Cafe
"small, cozy and with plenty of great tasting desserts and coffees. hazelnut coffee=",5,Candy Cafe

they have a policy for order one item per person. a place for chinese dessert.,3,Candy Cafe
"pomelo mango is very nice, must try! bubble milk tea a little too sweet, should have options for selecting the sugar level and ice level.",4,Candy Cafe
"service was really good, the staff were friendly and welcoming. the desserts were delicious! i loved the atmosphere of this cozy place.",5,Candy Cafe
small but cozy little cafe with a good selection of sweets and drinks. lively atmosphere and friendly staff.,5,Candy Cafe

"first time trying chinese style lobster noodles  looks awesome  but actually not much lobster meat and noodles  the style is a bit unusual and weird for me, maybe i'm too used to the way they cook lobsters at burger & lobster ",3,Canton
a must for their soup in fact all food good,5,Canton
"no effort whatsoever in producing good dishes, all drenched in the same sauce  despite being completely different on the menu. if you don't look asian expect gloopy dishes, even if you order the real deal. spicy dishes come without a trace of chilli. did i also mention extremely rude staff? can't recommend it.",2,Canton
very good,5,Canton
a basic no drills chinese eatery handy for theatre land.  no pretensions and a decent price.,5,Canton
"unpretentious, no-frills quick food. large glasses of drinkable wine at 3.50. good pit stop before a show! ",3,Canton
"a 3.6 rating may be misleading - seems a bit low to me. the decor and presentation may not be michelin quality, but the food is certainly delicious - in addition to being an extremely economical option. would surely recommend.",4,Canton
very nice and quick,5,Canton
food was good but we had a feeling that the staff was rushing us.,2,Canton
love the place for both sit down and take away meals. ,5,Canton
not the greatest food. food came quickly but starter came after main had been served. ,3,Canton
"the worst food i've ever had in chinatown. no better than a rubbish local takeaway, bad ingredients cooked badly.they claim to have authentic handmade noodle dishes but when it comes it's dreadful, inedible. i only ate one mouthful and left the rest. go anywhere else at random and it'll be better than this.",2,Canton
fantastic food. great atmosphere. excellent service. the friendliest waiters in all of china town - maybe even london. a must for a night out with friends!,5,Canton

"good place for chinese roast meat, crispy duck and stir fried dishes. friendly staff",4,Canton
really bad customer service. we ordered two different noodles but was served the same thing. the waitress didn't even give us a proper answer when we asked her. wouldn't recommend this place.,1,Canton
the place is quite small and cramps. staffs are friendly. food that we ordered mostly very delicious except the last dish which was sio long poa were a disaster. unable to eat at all.,3,Canton
great duck and noodles were awesome,4,Canton
one of my favourite chinese restaurants in chinatown. very affordable yet good quality. extremely reliable.  staff (almost) friendly. ;-),5,Canton
this was the worst food i've eaten in any restaurant. it was tasteless and expensive. service and hygiene was poor. we would never have eaten here unless a website said it.,1,Canton
"by far the worst dumplings ive ever had. asked for the 10 grilled vegetarian dumplings, got 7 steamed dumplings. they took it back and clearly grilled the steamed dumplings so they were rubbery (as there was still only 7). then took a bite and the filling looked, spelt and tasted like pork but they kept assuring me it was vegetarian.",1,Canton
"went there last week for lunch. new menu with a great selection of authentic dishes. ordered roasted honey pork, roasted crispy pork belly, chicken with ginger and wine casserole. simple and comfortable environment, and reasonable price. will be coming back again.",5,Canton
"delicious food and friendly, quick service in reasonably decorated place close to leicester square. we had the set menu b for 2 people with extra chicken satay strips and it was spot on... if a little spicy! ignore the negative reviews but just check they take bank cards as you arrive. i would definitely go back again!",4,Canton
chinese. food. good. what else? the duck was juicy and crispy? go and see for yourself.,5,Canton
what happened to this place? i used to live round the corner and the food was reliably decent and reasonably priced. i went back today and the food was completely different - poor quality and a tiny portion and the price had increased by 30% to 3 years ago... i wont be going back. avoid :-(,1,Canton
roast duck is one of the best in soho but the prices have become a little steep. may explain why we managed to walk in and get a table on a friday night!,4,Canton

staff was very helpful  and good food especially the duck rice,5,Canton

i've been going to canton for over 20 years. always good food and fast service.,5,Canton
i've been going to this restaurant since i was a kid. it has been a family favourite for many many years now. it can be a bit cramped sometimes but just think of it as part of the charm. the food is great!!,5,Canton
horrible experience. never in my life that go to a restaurant served cool roast duck. the customer service is really bad as well.,1,Canton
"it was okay, not spectacular.",3,Canton
"i went there because i was craving baozhi/buns but they were really bad, warmish, way too much bun and the filling was small yet alright but not as tasty as i'm used to. and the staff was not really welcoming...",1,Canton
"we went there for bubble tea and it was amazing! good price, friendly staff and great tea!",5,Chatime
service is quite slow and not too friendly staff. overall classic milk tea was okay but not outstanding.,3,Chatime
nice drinks but use a lot of plastic and overpriced,3,Chatime
rude staff members and very slow in making drinks,1,Chatime
brown sugar milk tea is a bit too sweet (can't adjust the sugar) but good and taro is a good classic. i stop by every time i'm in london.,4,Chatime
too slow 20 minutes waiting after ordered .... and error on my order.,1,Chatime
"really long queue only for an incorrect order. when i told them it was wrong, the manager of the shift got upset at me. so many great places on this street - just choose a different one across the way.",1,Chatime
my favorite bubbletea,5,Chatime
"today i ordered one taro milk bubble tea and  brown sugar milk tea. the brown sugar is super super sweet, but i know some shops put too much brown sugar on it...but the taro milk tea was unacceptable...the colour of taro drink was not purple, but light brown...and the taste was awful...i really not recommend to anyone...",1,Chatime
i love their bubble tea! i've taken some of my travelling malay friends here and they've enjoyed it too. service is really friendly and patient. only downside is i never know if i need cash or not; sometimes they take card and sometimes they don't.,4,Chatime
tea latte with fresh milk,4,Chatime
"long queue and not worth it. doesn't taste anything better.  asked for regular sweetness and it was super sweet, i ended it throwing it away.",1,Chatime

my daughter loves their bubble tea,5,Chatime
nice selection of teas,3,Chatime
"we've been at this place in vancouver, toronto, la, miami, singapore, jakarta, and now london. they have all been pretty consistent in taste and quality. best place to go to wherever they are at if you are craving bubble tea.",4,Chatime
"very poor service! you ask for tea with no ice and you get with ice! once you realise and want to replace it, you get horrible response! basically, i had a very unpleasant experience more than twice in that place and thus not because of of their products it's because of the staff treating customers unfairly. such a shame!",1,Chatime
"my bubble tea tasted like fish sadly, the tapioca pearls were great but could not out do the taste and fishy smell of the tea. i have tried the peach green tea flavor and am unsatisfied.",1,Chatime
great bubble tea! however very inefficient with orders. took half an hour to get my order. the big reason it's always busy is because they move slow!,3,Chatime
"love this store. staff was very friendly, the bubble tea here was soo delish :).  my new regular bubble tea store.",5,Chatime
"i would recommend everyone to try this amazing bubbly tee from taiwan. i've been there for the first time, service was fast, tea was superb and for reasonable prices.",5,Chatime
decent bubble tea not the best but it's okay,4,Chatime
the bubble tea feels diluted. the pearls are a little too chewy,3,Chatime
"nice and authentic. the foam drink was too sweet though. you can get their online app, order it and just collect it there. however, they forgot my order so we waited for a while. they were very busy so i understand but we waited for like 40 mins.",4,Chatime
"was served by a young girl called ruby, such a lovely girl! i was so pleased by her amazing customer service and she really made my day. great girl! great service!",5,Chatime
this is the most popular bubble tea joint which has all the collaboration tea's like hello kitty's. for me too much sugar - make sure you get low sugar if you're over 13,4,Chatime
very friendly staff.  we left our shopping there accidentally and they saved it for us.  great tea and super design.,5,Chatime
"even though it was a busy day, drinks were made quickly but still really well. definitely will be going back soon.",5,Chatime
one of the best bubble tea you can get in london!,5,Chatime
"tried their chatime x sanrio tiramisu milk tea. it was very sweet - since i opted for regular sugar (which was a mistake i made on my behalf) - but nevertheless, it felt like i was actually eating the dessert. would love to come back and try their other flavoured drink from the collab series.",4,Chatime
"friendly staff, tasty bubble tea",5,Chatime
one of the best places to get various flavours of boba. love it!,5,Chatime
my families trip to chinatown is never complete without a boba from chatime. you could say it's tradition - lol  they almways make quality milktea,5,Chatime
good place for bubble tea and i would say still the best of amongst all the other places. the queues are very long though as it does get very crowded and the staff struggles to keep up with orders so minus point for that.,4,Chatime
nice atmosphere with an amazing selection of beverages,5,Chatime
affordable price and good quality drink,5,Chatime
nice options but the service is without a smile. looks like some forced labour people are working,2,Chatime

"terrible customer service!!! they were very rude when i asked about certain flavours (like i would know the difference between your 3 different honeymelon drinks) and got evil, angry-face stares towards myself and our kids. this is not a kid-friendly place. there are other boba places better than this. it's chinatown!",1,Chatime
great service and amazing products!,5,Chatime
"rude people, kept laughing talking chinese and i clearly dont understand. always on their phones clearly dont care about the customers or their business. over priced too. would not recommend!! other bubble tea places are 100% better, cheaper and tastier. avoid!!",1,Chatime

"we asked 3 things on the menu, they didn't have them and answered rudely. i'm sure i won't visit again. ",1,Chatime

average bubble tea,2,Chatime
basic bubble tea outlet. pretty smooth operations and very centrally located in chinatown. a lot of options so read the menu before queueing up. the queue moves quickly and you don't want to be holding up others. you can get in and out of here in 10 minutes.,3,Chatime
noice,5,Chatime
good tea,5,Chatime
bubble tea shop,2,Chatime

why they like to change the order instruction by them own?,1,Chatime
a wide selection of bubble tea and always tastes great but when busy it can get a bit to crowded.,3,Chatime
staffs are extremely rude. the drinks are just ok. definitely don't recommend it to anyone.,1,Chatime
"staff was so rude! the customer service is soooo poor, they speak their own language with rude facial expression in front of their customer.",1,Chatime
"apart from the service, i would really recommend the second bubble tea listed there(oops! forgot the name) but tastes so nice!",5,Chatime
decent bubble tea. but the place is often crowded,3,Chatime
a group of snobbish and rude hong kong shop assistants. they do not know what 'service' is. terribly made taro milk tea which is with disgustingly sweet flavour and impossible to drink. we threw it into the dust bin.,1,Chatime
"peach milk tea with tapioca pearles - lovely! .. a refreshing change from drinking normal leaf tea. plenty of choice here, massive queues during the weekend",3,Chatime
"the customer service was very bad. i ordered my drink and only changed the ice option before paying and then the cashier throws my ticket on the table. my hand was out to receive it, but clearly she didn't like me...the drink selections are good, but maybe can have a list of recommendations to help with selecting something new.",1,Chatime
"avoid - i feel sorry for the employees, but since the recipes were changed back in 2014, there's no point coming here (drinks watered down). this place is usually packed due to the location, and is horribly stuffy.",1,Chatime
tapioca pearls weren't cooked properly and terrible service,1,Chatime
one of the best bubble tea in london,5,Chatime
loooove the peach milk tea boba!,5,Chatime
loved it! ,5,Chatime
yummy!,5,Chatime
"love the drinks in here, they are great and so was the service. i dont get the negative reviews, my experience here has been very good. love the bubble tea....",5,Chatime
real real real bad service. staff made so many mistakes when ordering. and she did not admit,1,Chatime
"the first time i tried bubble tea was here, and it was okay. i thought it was just too sugary for me towards the end!",5,Chatime
"chatime is the best time , great drinks , hot and cold ....love those pearls...",5,Chatime
bubble tea in china town existed long before this cafe but this cafe brought in the punters... worth going in and finding a drink but since its opening there's been many more and some i might say are doing it better...,3,Chatime
chatime is usually excellent. this one is terrible and not worth visiting. the taro milk tea was very watery which tasted like regular milk tea. they also put in the wrong toppings in one of my drinks.,1,Chatime
lovely place to pick up a bubble milk tea however it can get extremely busy at times especially at the weekends. the price is ok for london and the drink themselves is fairly average.,3,Chatime
"a large bubble tea franchise. as my initial description states it, the quality and consistency is just not to the level i would except from a large and experienced company.",3,Chatime
"extensive menu, chaotic queuing, great tea.",3,Chatime
great place to get bubble tea,5,Chatime
"coming from canada, and already in the midst of experiencing the obvious difference in drinks - we were pleasantly surprised by the familiarity of the drinks from this chatime and the one back home.unfortunately the drink selection was a bit lacking and tapioca pearls a bit hard and flavourless for our liking.",3,Chatime
nice bubble tea,5,Chatime
"love this place, nice staff and great service! the only problem is the massive queue all the time but that just proves how great this place is!",5,Chatime
"rude staff, and drinks are never consistent. plus this chatime only give a regular drink on the free drink stamp which the other chatimes will do a large drink. always busy and not worth the wait.",1,Chatime

loved the tea!,5,Chatime
"a relatively crowded branch, but still nice flavor~",4,Chatime
i have been to several chatime from manchester to london and got the worst experience here because of a very impatient and rude employee who deserves zero star.,1,Chatime
coco is better.,2,Chatime
i always come back for more! worth the long queues.,5,Chatime
i swung by when i saw an opportunity when it was the least busy. ordered a jasmine milk tea and got my drink quickly. might have been a fluke but my milk tea lacked jasmine flavor. i'd try it again the next time i'm in the country. ,3,Chatime
just not very good,1,Chatime
the bubble teas here are good but the waiting time is long and service slow,2,Chatime
rude staffs. repeated my order twice to this chinese girl staff and still order my drink wrongly. asked for exchange and she said repeated my order to me in poor english yet ignoring me a very bad attitude. ,1,Chatime
queue was very long. product was similar to other tea places.,3,Chatime
just rude.,1,Chatime
a lot of the popular drinks had run out so there was not much choice available however service was good and quick,4,Chatime
"the queues can get really long here, which is weird because imo its not the best place for milk tea- even in chinatown.",3,Chatime
"long queues always,but nice bubble tea.",3,Chatime
"good place for bubble tea but unfortunately they tend to run out of stock very frequently. last couple of times i have been they didn't have pearls,  or only had 1 flavour left! ",3,Chatime
it's nice that they started accepting card payments. best milk tea around! can get busy at times tho,5,Chatime
extremely rude staff. glared at me for no reason whatsoever. what's wrong with them? bubble tea is just okay. definitely don't recommend here to anyone.,1,Chatime
great service i hope they dont discontinue the stamp cards in favour of their annoying app,5,Chatime
can't beat a classic milk tea! service is very friendly.,5,Chatime

bad slow service.,1,Chatime
extremely rude workers! i dont know what happened to those workers that make them cant speak politely to customers. they even threw the changes to the customer in front of us. really really rude! i would never go there again ,1,Chatime

very nice,5,Chatime
big queues and a bit chaotic. enjoyed my bubble tea.,4,Chatime
not a fan of the tea here,2,Chatime
the best bubble tea in chinatown and perhaps the most underrated. it has a richer tea taste than its rival biju. try the roasted milk bubble tea with grass jelly and pudding topping! ,5,Chatime
awesome bubble tea place! :d,5,Chatime
this place is so busy all the time but that's why the pearls are consistently fresh and chewy :),5,Chatime
the classic chatime milk tea is always a favourite in this place. fast and friendly service.,5,Chatime
great selection of bubble milk teas but they stopped serving coffee jelly....what gives?,2,Chatime
fast serving tea. if you are in hurry you should visit here. you can get your drink less than 3 mins,5,Chatime
queue is often very long and the staff is not very friendly. the drinks tastes good but definitely not the best for their price range.,4,Chatime
extremely bad services! would never go there again!,1,Chatime

"awesome, yum!",5,Chatime
worst bubble tea i ever had... but i give 2 because my friend liked it.,2,Chatime
bubble tea here tastes great with loads of options at reasonable prices. my only complaint is that often they sell out from the different flavours which leaves limited options for your order. ,4,Chatime
one of the most well known bubble tea chains worldwide. there is always a queue here as they are quite slow in brewing but the taste is always consistent ,4,Chatime
nice drink but very small and long waiting.,4,Chatime
rude staff and always in a rush to close up.,2,Chatime
staffs need to be more polite and patient.,2,Chatime
lively and lovely place to select bubble tea- a speciality in taiwan. choose ur own flavour drink and decide whether you want pearl bubble or grass jelly! ,4,Chatime
"pretty disgusting, they use water to dilute drinks just to fill the cup instead of adding more of the base",2,Chatime
excellent boba in the entrance to chinatown. a classic joint.,5,Chatime
a proper taiwanese bubble tea cafe. authentic in taste and variety. unpretentious. ,4,Chatime

butter chocolate biscuits...nothing like you have ever had. i buy a packet every single week. expensive: 4.20 for around 13-15 biscuits but definitely worth it. their cakes are fluffy and have a great balance of sweetness and savoury.,4,Chinatown Bakery
decent and really interesting pastries. my favourite place to go for cakes in chinatown.,5,Chinatown Bakery
i got food poisoned from their sausage bun and reported this place to the authorities. avoid this place at all costs!!!,1,Chinatown Bakery

decent chinese bakery but wouldn't say it's the best. feel a bit touristy.,3,Chinatown Bakery
probably one of my favourite places in london and definitely my favourite bakery. great selection and decent prices and there's always something new to try. the staff is very efficient and everything is delicious. you should note that purchases under 10 have to be paid in cash.,5,Chinatown Bakery
"absolutely gorgeous bakery. the bread and buns are delicious. enough choices to grab some food for traveling.they don't accept amex, but most other cards are accepted. minimum 10.",5,Chinatown Bakery
"this bakery truly is a gem in london! it has variery of pastry choices and prices are more than reasionable. i would strongly recommend the wife cakes, egg tarts, coconut buns and the mooncakes. the only downside is unfriendly staff, but i get it, this place is always crowded and it's probably hard to keep up with that pace",4,Chinatown Bakery
fantastic range of delicious cakes!,5,Chinatown Bakery
love the egg tart and coconut bread so much!,5,Chinatown Bakery

pricey and bad hygiene. it's not very clear on what's what because the labels are crammed all together. the lady is way to tired and there's no rapport being build. they seem to be traditional baked goods but it doesn't have a great energy,2,Chinatown Bakery
favourite chinese bakery in london.  their egg tarts are fantastic and the buns are buttery and soft!  mochi balls with peanut have a lot of peanuts so those are a favourite as well!,5,Chinatown Bakery
they have all sorts of yummy cakes and savory treats,5,Chinatown Bakery

"this is one of those delicious hole in the wall places, i had the chinese crepe with belly pork, which tasted awesome and quite filling. no it's not the cleanest place but you don't go here for the 5* dining experience but for the authentic chinese street food. good if you're in the area looking for a tasty bite.",5,Chinese Tapas House 爱吃鬼小屋
"it is a good concept of selling, specialising buns that are tasty and convenient - the original concept of fast food, before mcdonald, kfc, etc. cooked/steamed until they are sold and consumed.if youre find yourself in the area and want to try something new, you wont be disappointed.i will definitely will go back.",5,Chinese Tapas House 爱吃鬼小屋

just there it ok,5,Chinese Tapas House 爱吃鬼小屋
really average food and the bubble tea was miserable. one thing i cannot tolerate is when the bubbles are too hard. they obviously left out the bubble way too long.,2,Chinese Tapas House 爱吃鬼小屋
"great  and beijing snacks. but the bubble tea's bubbles were not fresh, ie hard and not chewy",4,Chinese Tapas House 爱吃鬼小屋
"quite traditional chinese tapas, cant believe they have pork belly tapas. my husband love it.",5,Chinese Tapas House 爱吃鬼小屋
"had an extraordinary pancake thing from here, god knows what its real name is. consisted of a fried dough stick placed on a freshly cooked pancake with chinese sausage, spring onion and what tasted like hoisin or similar, then wrapped up in a cone. extremely necessary.",4,Chinese Tapas House 爱吃鬼小屋
be careful they secretly added things you didnt order.,1,Chinese Tapas House 爱吃鬼小屋

taro milk tea is great,4,Cuppacha
"i love their bubble teas, but sadly the quality is uneven. four times on five they are excellent, and the fifth time it's disappointing with flavourless tea. often quite busy. a lot of options, i already came here at least a dozen of times and there is still stuff i'd like to try.",4,Cuppacha
love the bubble tea!,5,Cuppacha
best boba,5,Cuppacha
my favourite tea ,5,Cuppacha
"cute place, good drinks.  wish it came out a bit faster though",4,Cuppacha
"long queues, but worth it. i ordered the milk tea hot with bubba, less sugar.. delicious!",5,Cuppacha
i have tried bubble tea from all over the world. the hazelnut bubble tea from here is the greatest thing to ever grace my tastebuds. i'd give it 100 stars if i could.,5,Cuppacha
i have tried the taro and cuppacha classic pearl milk tea. it was okay but not excellent. there is not enough pearls. the place is too small and not very comfortable.,3,Cuppacha
best hot drink in town ! it tastes better than it looks. #londonfoodie,5,Cuppacha
"i like hot olong tea, after a while they give me a lookwarm tea ..when i complain a man inside look at me angry, they say it is hot... but the girl offer to change it for me.",3,Cuppacha
"nice little place.the bubble tea tasted very good, but also very sweat :)would definitely visit again.",4,Cuppacha
"tiny and always busy, wide selection - hot taiwan ginger tea with tapioca pearls id my recommendation.",5,Cuppacha
best bubble tea i've ever had,5,Cuppacha
chinatowns best bubble tea!!,5,Cuppacha
very attentive helpful kind employees,5,Cuppacha
"had my first ever bubble tea here. was a bit sceptic to begin with as it is something i never tried before but my god how amazing it was!!! watermelon milk tea, tasted like pure watermelon, not too sweet just perfect. cannot wait to return. prices might be a tiny bit more expensive but definitely worth it!",5,Cuppacha
"i needed to stop visiting here, but all the teas taste so good. i don't love bubble tea per se, but love the tea itself. it can get really crowded here, but it's totally worth the wait. i wish they would expand and open another location. even dh thinks it's one of the best things on earth!",5,Cuppacha
"with a friend and my fiance we tried this place. there was a long queue, we waited more than 30 minutes to be serve. it was my first time trying bubble tea. i didn't like it at all.",2,Cuppacha
best consistency out of all of the shops in china town,5,Cuppacha
"best bubble tea shop around. along with a great selection of flavours and 'toppings' (bottomings?) you can choose how sugary your drink is. there's usually a seat free on the bench inside, there aren't many benches outside in china town.",5,Cuppacha
"been there twice and i really like it, good customer service and quality, very fast too.",5,Cuppacha
didn't have the ombre but enjoy my lychee black tea and white peach oolong!,4,Cuppacha
really nice place,5,Cuppacha
decent prices and a refreshing selection of drinks and snacks to choose from. staff get quite confused with orders when store gets super busy though,3,Cuppacha
good tasting bubble tea with plenty of varieties. just need to sort out their air conditioning during summer periods.,4,Cuppacha
best boba in chinatown...,5,Cuppacha
"a great bubble tea place. a very wide selection of flavours, and bubbles - a lot of customisable options (sugar level, ice level, size is medium or large) hot and cold teas avalible.",5,Cuppacha
loved it,5,Cuppacha
"friendly, efficient staff. decent flavour range. relaxed atmosphere. always a pleasant experience. has a loyalty card scheme too!",4,Cuppacha
very helpful staff.,5,Cuppacha
"first time ever going to this place for bubble tea and it was a huge mistake, i mean that because of the queue, the wait was at least 20 minutes, packed with local students from the london school of economics, it was definitely worth the wait.",3,Cuppacha
one of the best bubble teas in london! make sure to get a loyalty stamp card if you are a local!,5,Cuppacha
"even with two other bubble tea places within walking distance, the line is out the door. similar prices to other bubble tea vendors but has a unique and extensive menu! would return.",4,Cuppacha
finally a good taro milk tea!,5,Cuppacha
one of the best bubble tea place.,5,Cuppacha
delicious bubble teas..,4,Cuppacha
best milktea in london!,4,Cuppacha
my favourite bubble tea place,5,Cuppacha
nice tasty bubble teagood variety of flavoursnice options 're popping balls / jellieslots of options 'regarding sugar and ice levelsnowhere to sit really queues possible,4,Cuppacha
"also very good bubble tea here! this street has two good options for bubble tea, i still don't know which one i like better. service here is friendly and the bubble tea is yummy. don't forget to ask for adjusted sugar levels and ice! (else it is so so sweet)",5,Cuppacha
busy af. not really worth the wait though. it's fine.,3,Cuppacha
"tasted buble tea here, which was wonderful",4,Cuppacha
grear bubble tea! quite a long wait though ... usually busy.,4,Cuppacha
"almost batting in the same league as happy lemon (not quite there yet).some of the syrups they use are phenomenally sweet, the ombre range should come with a warning.other than this, they make one of the best bubble tea in london and i wish i had one locally!",4,Cuppacha
would recommend good tea,5,Cuppacha
super tasty bubble tea - great range of flavors! you can adjust sweetness and temperature of the drink and creating your own favorite combos! :),5,Cuppacha
the guy at the counter has this very horrible attitude. even trying to correct my pronunciation with his broken english. i would score it lower if 1 star is not the lowest. the tea is fine by the way.,1,Cuppacha
so excited when i saw this shop. i got taro tea with pearls. absolutely delicious. lovely friendly man serving at the till and a very clean waiting area. highly recommended,5,Cuppacha
got the strawberry and mango juice with mango jelly and lychee popping boba and it's really good! it's nice there's fruit options for those who don't want the milky tea.,5,Cuppacha
"amazing range of bubble tea flavours,which is good but can be a bit overwhelming if it is your first time. you can choose sweetness ice and size of drink, while the tea itself tasted very nice.",4,Cuppacha
great bubble tea and wide range of selection! bubbles are tasty. sadly not much space inside and no tables.,5,Cuppacha
you can get really good bubble tea here!i usually get the roasted oolong pearl milk tea which  has got quite a unique taste to it.lots of other flavours to get so its really cool place to stop by if you're in the area,5,Cuppacha
second boba. loving it.,5,Cuppacha
"fast service, even when super busy",5,Cuppacha
one of the best bubble teas in london. also slightly better value than other bubble teas nearby.,5,Cuppacha
i like the white peach oolong,5,Cuppacha
best bubble tea in london! i would recommend the caramel milk tea with taro bubbles.,5,Cuppacha
the bubble tea tasted really bad despite other reviews. it tasted like soap and plastic i'm not sure how to describe it but it tasted exactly like washing up liquid water...,1,Cuppacha
bit cramped but the bubble tea was nice,4,Cuppacha
amazing bubble tea with a range of flavours. i always experience great cost omer service too. it does get quite busy but you get served quickly.,5,Cuppacha
great one but the queue is just unreal. 30 mins for a bubble tea lol,4,Cuppacha
delicious but i am not sure how healthy it is.,4,Cuppacha
fantastic service. delicious products. i could live in this place!,5,Cuppacha
"took half an hour and 10 for two drinks, not worth the wait.",3,Cuppacha
"is a busy place, but is nice",3,Cuppacha
"i have a feeling that the quality has deteriorated somewhat since the first time i tried it. service has gone slightly worse. i stopped getting extras. it takes longer to get my order. overall, the place is still decent though.",4,Cuppacha
"good tea, but they are slow like hell",3,Cuppacha
i like that you can choose the sweetness and the amount of ice. milk tea is a little bit bitter than most bubble tea places but it still suited my taste. usually less busier than the other bubble tea places around and inside has a nice atmosphere.,5,Cuppacha
probably one of the best bubble teas you can find in london. you can always notice that their recepies are considered great even by those that are more picky in their bubble teas  their original cuppacha milk tea with tapioca is incredible!,5,Cuppacha
the tea is lovely and it's great that you can customise the amount of sugar and ice that you want. the amount of options for different types of tea is vast too and you can choose your own toppings so you can truly create whatever you want. the staff are friendly and service is efficient even when they have big queues.,5,Cuppacha
the best bubble tea place we have ever been to. theres a line out the door for a reason! we will definitely be back here every time we come to london.,5,Cuppacha
"best bubble tea around, personal favourite: honey dew milk tea less ice 50% sugar and tapioca pearls.",5,Cuppacha
"bubble tea was good but serving system not quite right, had to wait several minutes to order & then more minutes to receive the drink.",3,Cuppacha
"if you've never had bubble tea before and don't really have a sweet tooth, try the original cuppucha milk tea (it's asam tea) with slight sugar (just one up from no sugar. these things get really sweet, even with half sugar), with pudding (smooth and subtly sweet) / tapioca pearls.",4,Cuppacha
my favourite bubble tea place! love how the sugar level can be customised as i find some bubble tea very sweet.,5,Cuppacha
amazing bubble tea definitely reccomend. love the variety and the staff are really kind. a bit hard to find but definitely worth looking for.,5,Cuppacha
"solid, wide range of good tea. rapid service. limited space inside.",5,Cuppacha
"taro root bubble tea, yum! ",4,Cuppacha
the milk teas here are so thick it's amazing,5,Cuppacha
nice choice of oriental teas,4,Cuppacha
very small so constantly being bumped into by people and expensive for bubble tea! tapioca pearls are even charged at 50p extra which should come normally at no extra charge. paid 4.30 for a regular drink and was too sugary despite asking for less sugar. won't be going back,2,Cuppacha
it's taste alright among the other bubble tea shop,4,Cuppacha
yummy must try rose milk! best bubbletea in london. ombre tea very pretty. taro okok.,5,Cuppacha
haha i had the ombre bubble tea which tasted great. they charged me 5 pence for a bag which they didn't really make clear ...,4,Cuppacha
great tea with many options,5,Cuppacha
very very friendly staff. the tea is absolutely amazing! tried the ombr and my oh my! a must!,5,Cuppacha
"has a variety of flavours and some flavours are really nice. meanwhile, some flavoured bubble tea are ghastly",3,Cuppacha
there are a variety of flavours to choose from and you can choose your sugar level which means that you can opt for lower or higher sugar. the staffs are also very friendly and the price is very reasonable for the quality and flavour of the tea.,5,Cuppacha
i am addicted to this place!!! i have tried few bubble tea shops in london but when i visited cuppacha i knew i was going to visit them more.the tapioca were soft and chew. they have plenty of flavours to choose from and the staff very friendly.,5,Cuppacha
my favourite bubble tea place. prices have risen by 10p recently. theres a large menu of different flavours and toppings. standard drink includes tapioca unlike chatime which charge 50p on top. it can get very busy and you will need to queue on weekends. they also have a loyalty programme.,5,Cuppacha
"great tea, great staff. always go for a bubble tea when i'm in the area.",5,Cuppacha
"they have a great selection of bubble tea flavours and topppings and allow you to choose the ice level and the sweetness levels as well. the fruit teas, especially the qq teas are the best and are just soo sweet and tasty here",5,Cuppacha
"you have alternatives but cuppacha has something special for me. a lot of choices, from hot to ice cold drinks, flavours and toppings.",4,Cuppacha
delicious milk tea in the heart of chinatown,5,Cuppacha
"delicious! had real grapefruit in my tea, whose zest was not very delicious unfortunately. otherwise, very cool shop.",4,Cuppacha
great selection of bubble tea options where you can select how much ice and sugar etc.,5,Cuppacha
"a very very busy shop has long queues if you don't mind standing in a line for a while, then this place is for you",3,Cuppacha
friendly staff and good selection of toppings. grass and fig jelly are a good alternative if you don't want to carb up on tapioca pearls. hot options are also lovely on a cold day. queues can be a bit long. ,4,Cuppacha
i had a lychee tea and it was so sweet it was absolutely disgusting and basically undrinkable. and i usually like 100% sweetness if not more! i think perhaps maybe someone screwed up my order because it was ridiculous to the point it must have been an error.,1,Cuppacha
i know bubble teas are so bad for you but these things are so addictive and i must have had more than 10 drinks here! my favourite so far is the matcha green tea with red bean. most of the time the queue extends out of the store but service is pretty quick so you should be in and out in 5-10 minutes.,4,Cuppacha
"just a normal bubble tea shop, nothing special about the drinks.",3,Cuppacha
they have a great selection of flavours (that are not always available depending on who is manning the counter) however service here can be incredibly slow and does anyone really have 30 minutes just to wait to get a bubble tea?,3,Cuppacha
"one of the best bubble tea places in london, it has all the right stuff - vast number of flavors, hot or cold options, and amount of sugar. prepare yourself for a long queue.",5,Cuppacha
great taiwan bubble tea in chinatown! the staff comes and goes so the quality varies a little - most of the time is good but sometimes unfortunately will be a bit let down.,5,Cuppacha
the matcha bobba is one of the best.,5,Cuppacha
best bubble tea in london,5,Cuppacha
"delicious bubble tea, coffee jelly with milk with a tea underneath but a revelation was my friend's matcha with that tapioca topping! 50 p difference between a big or medium size makes decision easier and customise sugar is an excellent choice. almost 30 minutes waiting in a queue was a downer, avoid weekend peak times!",4,Cuppacha
lots of variety. very tasteful,5,Cuppacha
passion fruit tea with passion fruit popping pearls ,5,Cuppacha
good bubble tea!,4,Cuppacha
"i normally go to t4 for bubbletea but when i am around chinatown, i will go to this shop which is still good.",4,Cuppacha
the best bubble tea int he world!,5,Cuppacha

amazing bubble tea!,5,Cuppacha
i love this place whenever i'm in london i will go out of my way to get here - the drinks are soo good!!,5,Cuppacha
the absolute best place for bubble tea in all of chinatown. quick and very helpsome and friendly staff.,5,Cuppacha
good offerings with a friendly environment where you can have a short stay to enjoy your drinks,5,Cuppacha
"large, cold hazelnut milk tea with tapioca pearls, less ice, half sugar. not for sharing!",5,Cuppacha
"great choices, queue moves fast, friendly staff, japanese snacks also for sale at counter. ",5,Cuppacha
"incredible bubble tea. there are so many options for flavours, bases, tapioca pearls, jellies, size and amount of sugar. definitely worth a visit.",5,Cuppacha
great selection. tasty bubble tea and friendly staff.,5,Cuppacha
"crowded, but tasty and interesting bubble teas:)",5,Cuppacha
"service is slow even though there 3 people tunning the shop floor. ordered two drinks,  one was overly sweet, and the other normal milk tea tasted weak.  i think i can understand why happy lemon has the larger queue of customers next door when they both sell sort of the same stuff.",2,Cuppacha
"waited only and few minutes and the staff were very friendly. i had a milk tea with bubbles (tapioca) and crumbled oreo biscuits on top. super tasty! get with regular sugar level or it will be far too sweet.they also serve steamed buns and loads of other bubble tea flavours and different ""bubbles"". will return!",4,Cuppacha
bubble bloomin' tea. why not!,5,Cuppacha
great bubble tea well made.,4,Cuppacha
lovely bubble tea and lots of sugar customisation options. if you choose regular sugar option it might be sweeter than you expect..   no blueberry or lime option.,5,Cuppacha
"nice teas, but too expensive",4,Cuppacha
not the best place for bubble tea,3,Cuppacha
favourite bubble tea spot. have been getting my bubble tea fix from this place for five years. haven't found another place as good as this. so happy that they've started selling steamed buns too.,5,Cuppacha
best boba place so far i know in london.,4,Cuppacha
"one of the better bubble tea places in chinatown. their fruit teas are superb for hot weather, their chewy tapioca balls a bonus!",3,Cuppacha
soo many options and you get to control the sugar and ice in your drinks but i wish i got to do it for the specials drink i got because it was too sweet,4,Cuppacha
"i guess if you like waiting 40 minutes for a cup of tea, then this place is your cup of tea",2,Cuppacha
best taste and value for money around the chinatown area ,5,Cuppacha
a great tasting selection.,5,Cuppacha
love the shop. go in most evenings. could do with being bigger or having and in door and out door to better deal with queues,5,Cuppacha
one of my favourite places!,5,Cuppacha
better variety of flavours & toppings vs the other bubble tea shops nearby.,5,Cuppacha
"friendly helpful staff, loyalty scheme and amazing bubble tea! the price is also decent. this is my go-to place when i am around chinatown. it is definitely worth waiting in line for an amazing bubble tea!",5,Cuppacha
babe bubble tea in town. definitely try honeydew in hot milk flavour it one of the best ones they have,5,Cuppacha
amazing bubble tea,5,Cuppacha
"love this place!! so many flavours and varieties to choose from and lots of toppings too. brilliant that you can choose your sweetness levels and amount of ice. great, helpful staff and fairly priced. the mango milk tea is fab and the lychee popping boba is delicious :)",5,Cuppacha
one of my favourite places in chinatown london! a must go! you need to try the milk bubble tea! delicious! sometimes has a queue but it's worth the wait! ,5,Cuppacha
"lots of options but the first two ones i ordered they didn't have. but when i ordered one they had it was great. very busy, so a bit of a wait but it was worth it!",4,Cuppacha
service isn't the best but the bubble tea is nice,3,Cuppacha

speedy service!,4,Cuppacha

nice staff and good ice tea :),5,Cuppacha
"amazing bubble tea! i really like this place and stay loyal to this shop as i believe they do the best bubble tea. the choice is big and staff always helpful. it's really worth a visit. at times it gets busy and people even have to line up outside the shop, but that's usually in the evenings.

taro milk tea with tapioca bubbles are amazing. they don't contain any gelatine either so perfect for people with halal diet.,5,Cuppacha
by far the best experience for my first boba tea,5,Cuppacha

i used to really enjoy cuppacha - great bubble tea and my boyfriend is happy because they do proper tea with popping candy and tapioca! unfortunate recent experience where someone barfed all over the floor and the staff did literally nothing about it which is rather disgusting.,3,Cuppacha
one of the better bubble tea places in london.this one is always consistent and their taro always very good ,5,Cuppacha
thank you to the kind cashier lady who complimented my tattoo. always a good service.,5,Cuppacha
absolutely love their bubble tea.,5,Cuppacha
tea is good and staff is nice. i specially liked morgan for hiz patience and his smile. it's very busy so there is almost never a place to sit and there is no place to stay and enjoy your drink. no toilet facilities available.,3,Cuppacha
"best taro milk tea i've ever had, it's smooth and creamy and perfectly sweet, staff are really nice and helpful despite how busy the store is! i also had soy milk because i can't have dairy and the flavour was amazing! really glad they have non-dairy options ",5,Cuppacha
for someone that loves bubble tea i always come here when i'm in london. especially love the strawberry milk bubble tea! if your new to cuppacha and don't like your bubble tea too sweet i'd recommend having less sugar in it.,5,Cuppacha
great place to get a cup of bubble tea. wide selection of toppings and flavours,5,Cuppacha
"i ordered ombre tea with blueberry flavour, it was very sweet eaven though i ordered it less sugar, in general it was quite good for its price, the shop itself was really and the line was so long, that it continued eaven outside of the shop. the service was nice, and quick.every 10th tea is free.",4,Cuppacha
"very long wait for a disappointing boba milk tea. was hoping this would be a great boba shop, but ended up with a watered down milk tea. look elsewhere",1,Cuppacha
"good bubble tea. fast efficient service - we ordered the cuppacha pearl tea which was good, reasonably priced and took about 5mins to arrive after ordering, seats available for waiting. can pay by card. conveniently located near leicester square tube and chinatown. takeaway shop.",4,Cuppacha
"tons of different flavor options. hot or cold, different sugar options, ice or none, different bubble and jelly options. they also sell steam buns.",5,Cuppacha
hands down the best bubble tea in all of london and quite possibly all of england. i never go to anywhere else as their quality is hard to beat. have been a loyal cutomer for many years now and always go when i get a chance.,5,Cuppacha
bad bubble tea :(,1,Cuppacha
"waited so long for a drink and it was super sweet, couldn't finish",1,Cuppacha

gotta love a good cup of bubble tea,5,Cuppacha
"lovely bubble tea with lots of options. there may be a queue  of peope waiting, and sometimes they don't have internet to pay with card, but still worth it if you like this type of cold tea.",4,Cuppacha

loved the place so much. the lady who served me is such a sweet person and the bubble tea was amazing. thank you!,5,Cuppacha

"excellent bubbletea with a wide range of flavors. they don't just have the regular milk based ones, they also have water based and more lemonade like ones, with jelly, bobba and popping pearls. only downside is that it's a small shop that's very warm and you often have to wait a while, but it is worth the wait. prices are good too",4,Cuppacha

delicious matcha redbean tea. big variety of fruit tea.,5,Cuppacha
the bubble tea is food but they are outrageously slow for mediocre tea. i really like their bubble tea but not worth the wait. also... i think their pork bun gave me extreme diarrhea so be weary and ask them when they were made. the pork bun was delicious but made me really sick that night!,2,Cuppacha

"this place is one of my favourite places to visit in london. there's no sitting in, it's literally just a take away option, but the range of flavours and toppings are incredible. me and my partner have been twice and each time we have not been let down. the prices are excellent considering how large each doughnut is.",5,Doughnut Time
first visit and definitely won't be the last,5,Doughnut Time

"if i was going by i'd get a doughnut but wouldn't come specially. they are a bit overpriced. i wanted a sugar doughnut, don't like fillings but they didn't have it so had the nutella one... lots of nutella inside. this is just a kiosk, so you can only takeaway or eat it on the street.",3,Doughnut Time
may be a bit pricey but for the size of the doughnuts and the variety it's defo worth it!,5,Doughnut Time
they do percy pig doughnuts. well worth the trip!,5,Doughnut Time

quite possibly the best doughnuts. great selection with the funniest names. give it a go ,5,Doughnut Time

"really fun little kiosk a short walk from china town.yes the doughnuts do appear a little overpriced but wow! they are huge! we really enjoyed the ones we had, each probably contains your daily calorie intake but oh well!they also offer a loyalty card which is stamped for every doughnut you buy.",4,Doughnut Time

"prepare yourself for a queue, luckily it goes fast. innovative names and even more innovative looking doughnuts might confuse you to thinking that your eating something else than deep fried flour and sugar. if you want to slash +4 on that, this is definitely worth it. if you just need a sugar hit, go to anywhere that sells doughnuts.",4,Doughnut Time
"we passed this counter several times while walking the streets of london. we caved on the third pass, and it was worth it. we tried the chocolate orange, the nutella filled, and the cookie dough. while a little pricy, the doughnuts were large, and the staff was very friendly.",5,Doughnut Time

"randomly found it on a while walking through london, not only are the doughnuts big and tasty the flavours are fun and silly which is great. the girl in there was really nice and helpful as well making my selection for me when i couldn't decide... if you happen to see it, thanks twix one was a great choice",5,Doughnut Time
i'm fat now but it was worth it.,5,Doughnut Time
spectacular doughnuts,5,Doughnut Time

"ok, this place is legit. great donuts with a variety of flavor combinations. you could split one easy.",5,Doughnut Time
meh..................... something is off with this place. australia still had the best when they where open! heavy and stale unfortunately,3,Doughnut Time
best doughnuts. i love these guys,5,Doughnut Time
nice treat now and then,3,Doughnut Time
"not bad doughnuts, but they are very big and clunky. you are far better served with crosstown, which have in my opinion a more polished and delicate flavor profile than this.",3,Doughnut Time
"the bueno mars doughnut was the best doughnut i have ever eaten - and i've eaten a lot of doughnuts. of all the ones i tried i was impressed, huge, amazing dough, generous fillings, ridiculous and unique toppings... best doughnuts ever",5,Doughnut Time
"so worth the wait, so delicious!",5,Doughnut Time
"doughnuts are absolutely delicious, my favourite was a red velvet cream cheese one but they seemed to have doing this one last time i was there. also have vegan ones",4,Doughnut Time
possibly some of the best doughnuts in london,5,Doughnut Time
"went there really late at night, sadly there wasn't much choice but the two doughnuts i had were amazing can't wait to go back to london to try more.",5,Doughnut Time
"ive been here a few times now. excellent merchandising, but this place is very hit-and-miss. the donuts generally arent fresh enough. too bad.",3,Doughnut Time
stranger rings donut . filled with nutella. definitely a two person operation to finish. amazeballs.,5,Doughnut Time
best food i've ever eaten in my entire life!!!!!,5,Doughnut Time
"i love the donut time in old street, i came to the piccadilly one with my sister after dinner and was so excited but there were flies crawling all over the donuts! it made me feel sick so we instantly walked away!",1,Doughnut Time
"one for 4.5  a little bit too expensive , i order the one with chocolate crumble on the top and with some ganache dressing without stuffing inside . its good but not great , i will say it is so so and maybe other flavor will better.",3,Doughnut Time
best doughnuts in town imo (also i love the puns),5,Doughnut Time
the best tasting doughnuts ever.,5,Doughnut Time
"the first time i went i had a jam doughnut which was good. the second time i got a nutella doughnut, which was very dense and dry, and a snicki minaj which had better dough but was way too sweet.",2,Doughnut Time
5ver for a doughnut...dont need a meal after it.,5,Doughnut Time
side doughnuts packed with flavours. they should open a coffee shop so you can have a coffee with the amazing doughnuts.,5,Doughnut Time
very tasty fast and efficient. only thing no napkin as very sticky,5,Doughnut Time
"beautiful little store, could do with a few more flavours but not complaining as the doughnuts were delicious",5,Doughnut Time
amazing ,5,Doughnut Time

love the nuttela stuffed doughnut  prices from 4 and above good size,4,Doughnut Time
"very lovely, staff are nice and the doughnuts, whilst expensive, always hit the spot",4,Doughnut Time
"funny seeing 5* reviews when the shop had not opened / existed in this location...also, shop was closed within its opening times - with no indication when it would be open, so it's roll-the-dice if you are paying a visit.",1,Doughnut Time
delicious doughnuts! emma was super nice and told us lots about the different flavours :),5,Doughnut Time
"oooo these donuts! so for me the veruca salt (salted caramel) donut is a winner - fluffy donut and super tasty caramel (i could easily eat a bowl of that caramel) also the donuts have fab names, and are of course tasty :)",5,Doughnut Time
the filling tasted off and the staff were very rude. crosstown or even krispy kreme is much better.,1,Doughnut Time
"as homer would say... ""mmmmm doughnuts""you'll see the place as there'll be a queue. i'd recommend the whole doughnuts so you can enjoy the fillings.good options for vegans too!",5,Doughnut Time
lovely donughts sterp price about 4-6 each,5,Doughnut Time

tasty donuts very good quality,5,Doughnut Time
"nice place, a lot of vegan options",5,Doughnut Time
by far the worst doughnut i've had in my life. it was so hard and stale and just decorated with twix and made to look delicious. tasted like a 2 week old doughnut...then charged me 4.50 for it in stratford westfield!,1,Doughnut Time
"awesome, but not cheap!",4,Doughnut Time
delicious doughnuts!!! could have better prices though,4,Doughnut Time
huge am super delicious doughnuts,5,Doughnut Time
"amazing doughnuts. each of them is a piece of art. and quite filling.however, be ready to pay 4.50 for a doughnut...",4,Doughnut Time
"fun and funky. one doughnut is enough to share between 2 or 3 people, and extra large doughnuts are available too!",5,Doughnut Time
some were quite good but others might be a little too sweet. could you launch some less sweet choices please? (e.g. dark choc! ),4,Doughnut Time
"perfect doughnut everytime i go , i only get once a month now cause it a tad pricey for a 4 pack but nonetheless still deliciously good.",5,Doughnut Time
great doughnuts and very interesting flavours. friendly staff.,4,Doughnut Time
a fantastic selection of vegan donuts! i suggest they get some string to tie the boxes so they can be carried securely and easily.,5,Doughnut Time
"forget about the price, forget about the calories and enjoy one of the best doughnuts in town! - nice selection of fillings and great names...definitely recommend this place 5",5,Doughnut Time
"had a pb & j.lo, big, ugly, below average. heavy dough, cheap tasting jam and peanut butter, 4 each, so extremely bad value for money.  rather have a krispy kreme at a push or even better paul's chocolate doughnuts/beignets, no instagram needed there.",2,Doughnut Time
"sickly, just lots of sugar and over priced for doughnuts",1,Doughnut Time
it's always gay time doughnut is the best one!!! highly recommend,5,Doughnut Time
"brilliant shop! not the cheapest but anything bought here is certainly validated by its quality and uniqueness! products change regularly, but always a goid variety. i chose the houston, we have a biscoff, which was amazing! go out of your way to get here, it's a must visit.",5,Doughnut Time
amazing donuts,5,Doughnut Time
overpriced and not nice soft serve,1,Doughnut Time
amazing donut. i had the creme de la creme and wish i could have tried more. the bitter sugar on top offsets the sweetness of the filling.,5,Doughnut Time
so glad i dont live in london otherwise i would spend all my money  here and get really fat. best doughnuts ive ever had. when i visit london i always get a six-pack,5,Doughnut Time
the best doughnuts ever. theyre massive! (with a massive price tag) but sooo worth it. best ive ever had. there are so many vegan flavours and all sooo good,5,Doughnut Time
"best. doughnuts. ever. seriously this place is awesome, used to buy back in melbourne and so happy it's here now. staff are super friendly and helpful too.",5,Doughnut Time
disappointing. look better than they taste. krispy kreme much better.,2,Doughnut Time
delicious doughnuts - very sweet and sickly so probably a good idea to share. ,5,Doughnut Time
"had the nutella. overpriced. tasted old and refrigerated. not saying they were... maybe they're better in the morning after not being store the whole day... the doughnuts are more of a dense cake, not soft and warm like freshly made traditional ones.",2,Doughnut Time
overpriced. overrated.,1,Doughnut Time
huge and delicious treats.,4,Doughnut Time
delicious but pricey! definitely more of a treat rather than a weekly snack. i bought the doughnut with the ferrero rocher and it was delicious! also cost about 4. friendly service.,5,Doughnut Time
delicious donuts. takeaway only here.,5,Doughnut Time
great dessert place,5,Doughnut Time
i cant get over this place. best doughnuts going,5,Doughnut Time
amazing doughnuts. like kk on crack.,5,Doughnut Time
 who don't love a doughnut!?,4,Doughnut Time
prices are ok. but it's not the best vegan or non vegan donuts i've had. a bit of a disappointment. i've even gone to another doughnut time and had better donuts.,2,Doughnut Time
my favourite is the'pump up the jam'. good way to end a night out.,4,Doughnut Time
authentic,5,Doughnut Time
too much thick filling. the bueno bar on top tasted like it was 5 years old.,3,Doughnut Time

"great food. very busy and service not the fastest. but was chinese new year weekend, so maybe the reason!  not sure how fast usually. great food, kinda worth waiting for. staff friendly",4,Dumplings' Legend
"the dishes are good and some are very tasty. however, i've been consistently let down by the service. they've forgotten my order a few times and they can be quite rude/defensive sometimes, even though it's clearly written that i've ordered the dish. i've had to wait over an hour for a dish even though it was not crowded.",3,Dumplings' Legend
"get you in, get you out.... pretty much sums up the service here but that's not necessarily a bad thing. you come here to eat a lot and enjoy your comfort foods not sit down to a poncy meal. fyi the food is very good ",4,Dumplings' Legend
clean and spacious seating by compare of others places,5,Dumplings' Legend
"really good food. especially their dumplings, as you would expect. if you crave for some delicious chinese - definitely pop in or order online. probably would have ordered online if i didn't live that far as it tends to get a bit noisy in the restaurant.",5,Dumplings' Legend
great if you're out late night in central london and you happen to be near chinatown. dumplings are fantastic and it's pretty cheap. this is not a fancy restaurant though so see it as a casual place to eat. kitchen usually closes at 2am.,4,Dumplings' Legend
i had sour soup (starter portion) and pork&vegetable dumplings. both meals were very tasty. service was also very good and quick. pity that the place doesn't serve any desserts after 11pm. my friend and i really wanted something sweet.,4,Dumplings' Legend
"dim sum here was wonderful! it really hit the spot, one of the better ones in london. service was prompt, nothing to fault. prices were pretty reasonable.",5,Dumplings' Legend

awesome dim sum but poor service,4,Dumplings' Legend
great value and great food!! loved the dumplings!!!!,5,Dumplings' Legend
food was ok. service wasn't the best. they're in a hurry to rush through what you have to ask or say and that resulted in us having to ask for things multiple times! we only went here cos it had a high hygiene rating.,3,Dumplings' Legend
v friendly attentive service.,3,Dumplings' Legend
it is okay,3,Dumplings' Legend
great food and great service. i'll come again.,4,Dumplings' Legend

only for lovers of chinese food.,2,Dumplings' Legend
"dumplings are the best thing about this place. great options and full of flavour. everything else was a little bland. spring rolls tasted frozen and the rice added very little in terms of taste. dont try and be clever here, keep it simple and go for dumplings",3,Dumplings' Legend
good chinese food with dim sum as their speciality.,5,Dumplings' Legend
"good prices, quick service, so many options on the menu!",4,Dumplings' Legend

food was fantastic but service wasnt great. best chinese food i have had in a long while.,4,Dumplings' Legend
service wasn't great and i've had better dumplings at home. i guess that legend was that they were decent.,2,Dumplings' Legend
"wonderful dumplings, just be careful how you eat them when they first arrive very hot!",4,Dumplings' Legend
this place is amazing. i must stop whenever i'm in london. i have only been for lunch i may add. the sister restaurant down the road is just as good,5,Dumplings' Legend

the foods were tasty especially the seafood hofan.  it was delicious.  all those sims dishes were good too. do not know what reason i have diarrhoea all night long.,3,Dumplings' Legend
"tasty food and very good value for money. doesn't have a big dim sum menu if dining in the evening, but there are some options you can choose from. food is bought out quickly with an efficient service, a good go to place for a quick bite in china town where you won't be waiting very long for a table.",4,Dumplings' Legend
the quality of the food was nice.,4,Dumplings' Legend
dumplings are very good. the silken tofu with minced pork was amazing.,4,Dumplings' Legend
"the food was bland and service very poor, it felt like our presence was an inconvenience. if it wasn't for the fact that we'd had a long day and were tired we would have left.",3,Dumplings' Legend
"great atmosphere, nice decor and best of all the food! a great range on the menu and traditional and the dumplings are to die for, hence the name!",5,Dumplings' Legend
"great dim sum in a down to earth setting. the ordering process is a little confusing for the uninitiated but the quality of the food made me want to return, and i have a few times!",5,Dumplings' Legend
"awful service. waiter completely ignored us when we said our food was cold, after they brought the rice out 15 minutes before the mains. wont be returning",1,Dumplings' Legend
"my favourite guilty pleasure in london! definitely my favourite dumpling restaurant in china town, delivering consistent food quality and good pricing, look past the decor and fast paced service and enjoy their xiao long bao.",5,Dumplings' Legend
enjoyed a massive shared meal with family and friends. couldn't stop eating. such lovely food and attentive staff,4,Dumplings' Legend

"fairly expensive, takeaway quality food. probably fairly priced for the location, though",3,Dumplings' Legend
good value for money and good quality xiaolongbao!,4,Dumplings' Legend
"good dumplings, a bit pricey but good.",4,Dumplings' Legend
great dumpnings! i had to ask for more!,4,Dumplings' Legend
lovely place p,5,Dumplings' Legend

tasty!,5,Dumplings' Legend
rushed into deciding on menu choices and were not given change after paying the bill.,2,Dumplings' Legend
"best dimsum in china town! no frills, just great food. 100% recommend handmade prawn dumplings, they are incredible. prices are great and service is quick.",5,Dumplings' Legend
"the dumplings were lovely, but there was something lacking ... maybe the ambience and i don't think i'll be rushing back.",3,Dumplings' Legend
this place is pretty chinese and really good. it's more local than most of places you can find around. the beef with turnip is a must!they are very generous with vegetables and try the beef noodles as they have several ways to do them.,5,Dumplings' Legend
loved the food! great location. efficient staff.will be back (very soon!),5,Dumplings' Legend
"it was okay, all the dumplings we shared tasted the same. nothing out standing but the only restaurant that was open after 22:30 on a weekday which is great ( they open until 03:00) service was quick.",3,Dumplings' Legend
wow way too salty. pushy staff. i'm not part of a restaurant conveyer system. first time for me and my date. without doubt the last.,2,Dumplings' Legend
"decent quality, very fast service, i would go again but next time i will try the dumplngs.",4,Dumplings' Legend
"xiao long bao (excuse the spelling) is so fresh, it can't be beaten. expect your food to come very quickly, and your check to come quickly after.the variety of dishes is well executed and tasty with generous portions.",4,Dumplings' Legend
brilliant food. service was a bit slow and all over the place with multiple servers asking the same things. tables were crammed in quite tight so it felt like we were on top of the tables either side of us.,3,Dumplings' Legend
lovely place reward for not using cards great food,5,Dumplings' Legend
"value for money, quick service even though it was busy.",3,Dumplings' Legend
"good food, nice staff and good prices too.  open late. great find.",4,Dumplings' Legend
the soup inside xiao long bao seeped out right after serving. so the soup was all over the table instead. hope they fix this for food quality.,3,Dumplings' Legend
get there early and definitely try the bao! absolutely delicious!,5,Dumplings' Legend
busy restaurant with lots of people turning over all the time but food is just great and it is good value. the service is fast and not particularly friendly so ideal if you just want great food. try the dim sum range or the sia long bau which are very fresh and done by in the kitchen daily.,4,Dumplings' Legend
really great food and service was ok too. would highly recommend this place.,5,Dumplings' Legend
good portions and great service for nye!,5,Dumplings' Legend

"good dim sum, but cramped sitting space and grumpy staff.",4,Dumplings' Legend
the best chinese restaurant ever.never had a bad experience and i have been there 20 times now.super efficient and amazing food all the time.,5,Dumplings' Legend
"famous for its lovely dumplings. we didn't prebook and there was plenty of space. if you are after a huge plate of vegetarian noodles, ask as they are off menu and prepared specially. helpful staff, tap water offered with no fuss on a warm july evening. meal for two was 35. service included.",5,Dumplings' Legend
lovely food and good value for money in a great location.,5,Dumplings' Legend
i have eaten at my fair share of chinese restaurants and their egg fried rice with prawns was amazing. their dumplings were good too - i recommend the pan fried pork dumplings over the soupy ones.,5,Dumplings' Legend
"great service, warm and friendly staff, nothing to much trouble and explanation.  dumplings excellent as usual.",5,Dumplings' Legend
good standard dim sum. solid not spectacular.,4,Dumplings' Legend
wasn't disappointed but not wowed either. with every other restaurant in china town doing the same thing there is nothing to make it stand out.,3,Dumplings' Legend
"food was great! restaurant nice and bright, staff very pleasant",5,Dumplings' Legend
love the dumplings here. best in chinatown.,5,Dumplings' Legend
"easy chinese restaurant, tho really push to move customers through",4,Dumplings' Legend
"solid, traditional chinese. a good shout for china town",4,Dumplings' Legend
"friendly personnel, large portions food for a good price. dumplings weren't that great though",4,Dumplings' Legend
"delicious dumplings, busy restaurant but quick service",5,Dumplings' Legend
this is the one restaurant i return to time and time again. beautiful soup dumplings. staff are efficient but not personable. this is not something you should worry about as when you've queued for 30 mins to get a table you appreciate the efficiency of the place. service is charged on all tables. they served tap water. food is great.,5,Dumplings' Legend
daytime dumplings ok but not served in evening. bit of a rip off joint - the hurry you off the table and whack 12.5% service on the bill without asking. many much better places nearby,2,Dumplings' Legend
the staff are not friendly but the dumplings are so fresh and the food is damn tasty. a staple in chinatown and highly recommended,5,Dumplings' Legend
dumplings here are always supurb. they are handmade on sight. this is one of my favourite restaurants in london. highly recommend the xi long bao - soup dumplings,5,Dumplings' Legend
the food no so great! poor service and awkward atmosphere,3,Dumplings' Legend
"the staff where extremely rude. overpriced disgusting food and we where insulted by the staff. we eat out a lot and have never been so disappointed. we paid, but shouldnt have bothered.. rip off.. how they can get away with that type of behaviour and food is beyond me....",1,Dumplings' Legend
"staff are watching you all the time. considering they had over 10 waiters at once, it makes the atmosphere a bit uncomfortable. pls look into that otherwise, the dumplings were very nice. a bit pricey, but overall okay. bare in mind there is a minimum expenditure per person!",3,Dumplings' Legend
omg best chinese place about. food was amazing. you can bring your own alcohol too,5,Dumplings' Legend
"we come here every christmas and love the food. the dumplings were great, and the main course was equally tasty. be prepared to queue at times!",5,Dumplings' Legend
"the vegetarian menu was disgusting. really disappointed. i could have made nicer food at home. a lot of it was tasteless. fried spring rolls with no vegetables inside, boiled broccoli with some mushrooms on top. really don't know why it's so popular. will never come back if you paid me.",1,Dumplings' Legend
"very pleasant meal here with 4 others, sat up stairs. food arrived quickly. id recommend the set menu and some dim sum. good choice of beer and wine. and amazing a la cart menu as well. look forward to coming back. portions are big, so go hungry.",4,Dumplings' Legend
"our favourite place to visit when in london. our trip isn't complete unless we stop here. love the food, great value and fast service.",5,Dumplings' Legend
"good service. fabulous food, especially the dumplings. reasonably priced. lively atmosphere but not too noisy",5,Dumplings' Legend
we have long avoided this as it looked like a tourist trap but have been twice now and are hooked. prices slightly above average for chinatown but service is above average too. interior is well layed out and not as cramped as many of the other restaurants too. food was great which is always the key. will be back.,5,Dumplings' Legend
"dumplings' legend was recommended by a couple of friends, so we went there for lunch on a friday. the atmosphere was pleasant and service we extremely prompt; couldn't ask for much more. as for the food - sublime. some of the best dumplings i've ever had - and reasonably priced. an all round great experience.",4,Dumplings' Legend
"very good service. gourmet food. i recommend ordering sets, you can try a lot of things then. the best dish lemon chicken",5,Dumplings' Legend
superb food with very good servcie,5,Dumplings' Legend

absolutely brilliant! great authentic experience.  the service is really quick and efficient.,5,Dumplings' Legend
"delicious and fresh dim sum. service was fast and good seating area. waiter staff helpful and efficient but not anything additional. not a problem. food very tasty, recommend cheng fun and prawn dumplings.",4,Dumplings' Legend
"let's make one thing clear, these dumplings are not legendary. the other food we ordered was tasty hence the three stars but unfortunately we came for dumplings and were ultimately disappointed. i'd give this a miss if it's dumplings that you're after.",3,Dumplings' Legend
"one of my favourite chinese restaurants. pretty much everything i have had there was good, specially the dumplings and the green beans with mince pork and chili. the only thing i would complain about this place is the staff trying to kick you out even before you finished your food...",4,Dumplings' Legend
rude staff. disgusting food. they deserve to be bulldozed. worst meal of my life and expensive. when we complained we were answered abusively.,1,Dumplings' Legend
absolutely the best outside of asia! we loved the spicy pork ones and the shrimp one!! really really really really good thank you!!!,5,Dumplings' Legend
"food taste good, but customer service isn't the best part here.",3,Dumplings' Legend
quality dumplings with  wide variety of choice.recommend the spicy dumplings.,4,Dumplings' Legend
yummy. service is not very keen on helping you but the food is amazing. it can get very busy so just try it at odd hours.,4,Dumplings' Legend
"always busy so don't expect to be allowed to chill here for longer than it takes you to eat. however the food is excellent, such tasty fresh dim sum at a pretty good price (considering its location).",5,Dumplings' Legend
it was really good with a diverse menu. from spicy to sweet overall good food and really nice staff.,4,Dumplings' Legend
"favourite place, everything on the menu is amazing. spicy xiao long bao is incredible. accommodating to kids. prices are not that expensive!",5,Dumplings' Legend
"a tad disappointed given the excellent reviews. ordered a mixed platter of dumplings  but they were all prawn. ordered something else but wrong food came. then long delay for the right food, and very rushed service to get you to leave quickly so they can seat the next customers. when the right food did arrive, it was nice ",3,Dumplings' Legend
an excellent dumpling restaurant that is our favourite in china town. excellent quality with good prices.,5,Dumplings' Legend
dumpling legends earns name. has the perfect dumpling to prawn ratio. highly recommend the soup dumplings - so flavoursome. vegetable fried rice is also delicious. service was fast. i like how you can watch dumplings being made and cooked. also loved the music - very atmospheric. 5/5,5,Dumplings' Legend
i just love this place! not particularly fancy but love coming here with friends during a visit to london.,5,Dumplings' Legend
extremely rude staff. when we complained that there were no vegetables in the vegetable spring rolls the manager accused us of lying. complete rip off. unpleasant experience and expensive. they should be ashamed of their poor hospitality.,1,Dumplings' Legend
loved it!! went there with some friends and we had the most amazing buffet of dumplings! can't wait to go back!!,5,Dumplings' Legend
good selection of vegetarian dishes. got seated right away and we were 8. very quick service. vegetables seem very fresh and crunchy. not greasy as many other places. a bit on the expensive side thus one star off.,4,Dumplings' Legend
"good food, but how can they get away with such rude service! like another person already mentioned on the reviews, it's only acceptable because it's in chine town!so hospitality 1/5, food 4/5",3,Dumplings' Legend
"when it is dark and cold and nothing to eat... it was ok, but i would not recommend this place. nothing special about it.",3,Dumplings' Legend
"food is very good and cheap. unfortunately, the service is terrible",4,Dumplings' Legend

amazing. absolutely love their soup dumplings.,5,Dumplings' Legend
"probably the best dumpling and dim-sum restaurant in london. a huge range of variety, good quality, always busy. a bit overpriced.",4,Dumplings' Legend
"basic chinese food, nothing special",3,Dumplings' Legend
"great selection of vegetarian dumplings , buns and bao, probably the only place in the world where i have had vegetarian long bao and they were utterly delicious. a bit pricy and 12 percent service charge is applied. but you get a ten percent discount if you pay by cash. so thats nice",5,Dumplings' Legend
"speedy service, tasty food. great for a quick lunch in chinatown.",4,Dumplings' Legend
"great food, best friend rice",5,Dumplings' Legend
"must order the prawn dumpling, it is very delicious with thin skin and rich fillings (2 prawns in each dumpling). dont order the custard buns as they are even smaller than the dumplings.dont order porridge, as it is kinda plain.egg tarts not bad.yep basically all you need to order is dumplings.",4,Dumplings' Legend

place is ok  great location,3,Dumplings' Legend
not bad!!! came for dim sum everything was good and fresh. the har gow stands out as is big and 'sooghn' if you speak cantonese means has that fresh crunch thing going on. noodles and rice were standard fare so suggest sticking to the  good value dim sum.  our service was fine but note we are a family that speaks cantonese and chinese!,4,Dumplings' Legend
our go to place for dim sumgreat service huge choice only criticism would be to allow more time to finish drinks and food before bringing bill.,5,Dumplings' Legend
"we had the xiao long bao, prawn cheng fun, xiu mai, and custard buns and enjoyed it all. xlbs were fantastic and the custard buns were probably some of my favorite ever. fast service and good prices. very extensive menu will make you come back to sample more.",5,Dumplings' Legend

ok! i don't think i will go back.,2,Dumplings' Legend
"tasteless, unfriendly and overrated...by far. avoid, especially when surrounded by so many other better options.",1,Dumplings' Legend

amazing dumplings!! with delicious feeling inside it was meat and bulion melting in your mouth.. good price for such a nice restaurant in the middle of china town.,5,Dumplings' Legend
totally overpriced for what you get. service is rude and only focuses on making profit. we were provided with the bill right after we were done with our main course. the atmosphere has a really cheap impression and the food quality (especially the dumplings / baozi) has been a disappointment. definitely cant recommend!,2,Dumplings' Legend

dim sum was decent but the service is poor. however when you come to china town you don't go for the service so would recommend. xiao long bao were soupy and the spicy duck dumplings were good too,3,Dumplings' Legend
"the soup dumplings was ok, the dumpling dough was too thick so it takes away the taste of the broth and meat. the giant soup dumpling was disappointing, it was just dough with soup, the meat was almost non-existant. the service is quick and good and the dim sum shrimp dumpling was very good, big shrimp portion!",3,Dumplings' Legend
wonderful fresh dumplings are made there!,4,Dumplings' Legend
place was dirty and the food quality could be improved,1,Dumplings' Legend

fantastic dumplings. nice touch is that you can actually see them being made. try the fresh crab roe which is #1 on the dumpling menu.. delicious !,4,Dumplings' Legend
"the food was decent, but when i orderd soft drinks they came luke warm, and when i asked them to bring me some that was cold they said that they didn't have any. the place is also way too loud and the staff is not very polite.",2,Dumplings' Legend
the place for delicious long bao,5,Dumplings' Legend
"fantastic dumplings, fast and friendly service.",5,Dumplings' Legend
"the steamed dumplings were pretty scheisse and the ""fried"" rice should've actually been fried. also, the chicken with pineapple seemed to be lacking the named pineapple, but the dim sum and the duck wraps were satisfactory.",2,Dumplings' Legend
great dim sum. i love the xiu long bao! the overall atmosphere is a bit sterile.,4,Dumplings' Legend
"hecking good, been here several times",5,Dumplings' Legend

very nice chinese restaurant! reasonable prices and fast service.,4,Dumplings' Legend
the waiter who is a black man of medium height wearing glasses beated customers and the manager did not care. we have called and reported this online to the police. do not go to this resturant.,1,Dumplings' Legend

best dim sum in london ! th xiao long bao are just super and the honey barbecues pork stuff is a amazing good,5,Dumplings' Legend
absolutely amazing. the food is so nice and the staff are brilliant. we recommend 100%.,5,Dumplings' Legend
"delicious food and fast service. the dumplings are delicious but the other food is also great. you can see the dumplings being made by their cooks as you enter the restaurant. the staff were friendly and very accommodating, especially considering it was a very busy day and we were with a baby and pram.",5,Dumplings' Legend
poor quality food and poor service too :(,2,Dumplings' Legend

"good dumplings, but a bit overrated",3,Dumplings' Legend
great food at really good prices - always a safe bet in china town.,5,Dumplings' Legend
"in a dilemma to give 5 or 4 stars. it could be judged as good due to the fact that it is located in the uk. could have been better i think, especially if they could serve it with sweet sauce and chilli sauce, like how the authentic hong kong's dim sum is.",4,Dumplings' Legend
amazing food and immaculate service! will definitely visit again.,5,Dumplings' Legend

"delicious food,  great service,  all the wow without pretentious stuff.",5,Dumplings' Legend
delish roast meats.,5,Dumplings' Legend
we enjoyed the food here but the service was a bit of a let down. we had to wait ages for our dim sum order and then we were rushed to order more dishes within our alotted time frame. recommend knowing what you want before you arrive as it is not a relaxed experience. dim sum platter was definitely the best dish.,3,Dumplings' Legend
one of the best in china town. wicked food for a good price. although a little impersonal. they want you out as quick as possible to get the next guy in. would have been good to chill with a beer after!,4,Dumplings' Legend

great traditional dumplings.,5,Dumplings' Legend
good chinese food by london standards. most of the food would pass for good in asia. however the xiao long bao do fall short of din tai fung back home.,4,Dumplings' Legend
avoid at all cost. very expensive but low-quality dishes. ordered the fish with pickled veggie and fish was absolutely not fresh to a point that it made me gag. the pork used in the dishes and soup dumplings is also not fresh. overall a very expensive but miserable experience.,1,Dumplings' Legend
service was fast and good. food nothing special. given the name i would expect a larger dim sum offer. dim sum we tasted was good though but the duck was the driest i ve ever had. even my partner comented how much better is the one i buy to roast at home (it comes within a kit with pancakes and hoisin sauce for about 6 pounds!).,2,Dumplings' Legend
"we visit about twice a year. love the food. quick visit today for dim sum and tea. service never overly friendly, but in my experience straightforward and professional. thoroughly reccomended.",5,Dumplings' Legend

"great food! authentic taste, service can be better, but let's be honest: if the food is that good, i'm willing to compromise on service.",5,Dumplings' Legend
"we went there for dinner last night and it was really disappointing, mediocre chinese food / dim sum served by rude staff. one family had a major argument with one of the waitress as she was extremely rude! the atmosphere is not nice, i think they are serving for tourists, who will never return, rather than londoners!",1,Dumplings' Legend
food was not great at all and service one of the worst i've had ever,1,Dumplings' Legend
can't beat it for a late night chinese craving. service was efficient and friendly and the dumplings were fantastic.,4,Dumplings' Legend

i have eaten here a number of times now and have enjoyed it on each occasion. i love spicy sichuan cooking and the food here really hits the mark. the service is warm and friendly and the prices are reasonable. i will definitely return.,5,Ermei Sichuan Restaurant
"we were there on a monday night and the place was pretty full after 8pm.  it didn't look like many were tourists. the menu is too large to do more than sample in one go, but that's part of the fun.  good ma po.  large portions.  will likely go back if i'm in the area.",4,Ermei Sichuan Restaurant
"brilliant - amazing spicy dishes and a really adventurous menu. lovely, sleepy atmosphere - especially deep into the back of the restaurant, a very cool place.quite expensive and they tried to add service on card when they'd already slapped it on the bill - cheeky cheeky, so lose a star for that.",4,Ermei Sichuan Restaurant
"this restaurant is fantastic, love the decor. we enjoyed the food, very tasty and some great spicy dishes #hotpot #sichuanfood",5,Ermei Sichuan Restaurant
"the hot pot here is amazing. we ordered a spicy and non spicy soup. the order came with meat, seafood selection, vegetables and tofu and mushrooms. the price per person is a bit expensive but when is all you can eat then is a good price for london prices. the staff was attentive. good experience overall. ",5,Ermei Sichuan Restaurant
excellent sichuan food. cannot complain about that. why not 5 stars? they charge 12.5% service charge automatically and then sneak in an optional tip when you pay by card... not cool,4,Ermei Sichuan Restaurant
"genuine and very tasty sichuan food. if you thought chinese food is cannot be spicy, come here. great dishes, menu offers a very nice picked selection.",5,Ermei Sichuan Restaurant
good food. just refurbished and modernised,5,Ermei Sichuan Restaurant

"the hot pot was pretty good, go for the spicy one.",5,Ermei Sichuan Restaurant
decent service and food. not sure its value for money. they have a karaoke area downstairs that can be hired which is good fun after a dinner meal.,3,Ermei Sichuan Restaurant

"er mei has become a tradition for me and my boyfriend and we're trying to come at least monthly, when we start missing the taste. everytime we say we'll try something different but we end up having the same dishes because they're too delicious. i also love the changes in the menu and decoration. good job guys. keep it up ",5,Ermei Sichuan Restaurant

"i like the bar, they do very good drinks in a cool atmosphere. it is hard to get in; there's rarely space for walk-ins (so book ahead if possible) and the door is not obvious (but that just adds to the charm). overall i like it, just been turned away a few times too many!...maybe i should book...but spontaneity is more fun!",4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
love coming here!! cocktails are great and it's the perfect place for a chilled out drink away from the tourists in chinatown. you don't need to book but you do have to answer the door staffs questioning with a bit of confidence! ,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"this is a fun place to check out.  the cocktails are bizarre, sometimes in a great way, sometimes in a not good way, but for me, that's part of the fun.  you wont find drinks like this anywhere else!  i would have given 5 stars, but i think the staff could have been friendlier.",4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
nice and hidden! a bit pricey though,3,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
love this little hidden away bar. very small and cosy with unique cocktails,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"we only had the cocktails here and they tasted great. the service was really good. the entrance was so hard to identify that we walked past it twice. its in between 2 chinese restaurants in chinatown. i cant say for anything else on the menu but based on what we had and the atmosphere, i give it 5 stars.",5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"so beautiful and atmospheric. if you can find it and you like a good cocktail, and don't mind paying a bit more for it, i highly recommend it. the staff are so attentive and the music was great.",5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
was so drunk cant remember it! must have been brilliant,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"rocked up last night to a little tiny door with bouncers who just acted like we were dirt and had some of the worst interpersonal skills i've ever seen, even for bouncers. 5 entry to a cocktail bar where all you can see is an ugly door and two rude bouncers on the door. there's better places locally.",1,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"well theres a surprise! a two storey cocktail bar tucked away behind a very small door! a wide range of cocktails make it up or off the menu, you choose! upper floor is quieter than lower. two bars, one on each floor, so service is excellent throughout. usual london prices.",5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"exciting, tranquil and ethnic cocktail bar. sublime experimentation which leads to some world class cocktails. great atmosphere and bar staff was brilliant. one girl with blonde hair in particular made the night for us. door staff were a bit up themselves which is a shame but i guess that's why they work on the door....  ;)",5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"excellent service, excellent drinks, excellent ambience, excellent live music.",5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"cocktails are good once you get them. not that they took long to come once ordered but ordering in the first place was a bit of a struggle. all the food we also ordered came as we were about to leave a good hour and a half later, though it was tasty. just need a few more staff members.",3,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"such a great find, well hidden!!",5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
i really enjoy the athmosphere. cocktails were top too,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown

excellent service and great quality,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"they accept walk-ins but after 5 minutes they kick you out because they need the table for a reservation. the cocktails are just okay, nothing of experimental",1,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
wonderful hidden place ,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
overpriced and tried to charge me for more drinks than id had. i tried to be reasonable but they wouldnt have it. no semblance of customer service. dont bother.,1,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
clever cocktails and a lovely atmosphere.,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
expensive for what they serve. nice music,3,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"cocktails are surprisingly good, better than average. nice environment to talk and feel the music. i cannot make sense of the 5 pounds entrance fee though, kind of off putting.",4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
the staff here are incredibly helpful and i love that the cloak room is free. the cocktail list is not massive but it is imaginative and well thought through.  i don't think there is a single cocktail i could recreate at home. well worth a visit - if you can find it!!!,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
the staff were pretty rude and the music was so loud i had to communicate with my friends by whatsapp,1,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
amazing atmosphere,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"cocktail is just basic, prices are the way more exspensive with what you got! not really recomended. visiting at night just aware for extra charge.",3,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"really great bar, with nice drinks and atmosphere. however, it may be difficult to come in .",5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"great atmosphere and cocktails.  candlelit bar over 2 floors with a 30s vibe. stockholm syndrome, le montrose, smoke the rhino all v interesting. expensive but worth it. ",4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown

well made cocktails but not experimental by any means ,4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown

"high quality cocktails in a speakeasy atmosphere. expect to be turned away at the door, however, if you show up at peak time underdressed/without attractive company!",4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
a slightly different scene then i'm used to but amazing drinks and friendly staff.,4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
one of the best hidden bars in london.  cocktails are original but very pricy,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
great for good cocktail and quiet atmosphere but very few seats,3,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"great speakeasy style bar, tucked away in chinatown behind an inconspicuous black door. hidden gem!",5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown

absolute cool,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"nice atmosphere, too cosy to be comfortable ",4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
you should experiment with changing the door man. what a joke of a man. ,1,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
average and overhyped probably because of the location. 13 pounds for a cocktail... interior design was nice though.,2,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
great cocktails but not the best atmosphere,4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"extremely nice door staff , he is very handsome and nice .",1,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown

"speakeasy with nice cocktails, shame about the rude service",1,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
rude doors staff. tasty cocktails,3,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
something different in the heart of china town.not the cheapest place for a night out but worth every penny.,4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"i went on a saturday night so it was the typical crowded west end vibe. artisan drinks - all ice no liquor.  not enough seating.  however, table service is provided if you do get a table and there's a free clock room.",1,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"great cocktails and amazing atmosphere. however, it is usually hard to get in without reservations!",4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
always a treat to drink here. cocktails are the best.,4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"great cocktails, a little pricey ",4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"turned away at the door on a wednesday evening around 11pm, no questions asked. despite the website stating 5 cover, there is no reasoning to be had, nor favors to be won.  as a single individual, surely there was room for one person, given that the website states 50% is held for walk-ins.",1,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"rude door staff, delicious, but overpriced drinks. ",2,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
excellent. thank you to every one there. ,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
extremely busy but great atmosphere and decent cocktails,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"love the theme they went for, as if gatsby meets grand budapest hotel. something charming about the place. goo cocktails but a little cramped. think the whole 'secret' thing is overdone with a scary man at the door. i would expect more exclusivity when you enter.would go back though!",3,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
ridiculous prices,1,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
always a safe haven for great drinks.,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
crystal is the entire reason id go back. intelligent staff. open. great cocktails. get yourself a kota.a cocktail that takes 2 days to make. get to the door and say the place was recommended. well worth the time and money.,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
out this world cocktails and service,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
try spotting the entrance first time round... all very secretive and exclusive. great cocktails and sophisticated atmosphere. you get what you pay for...,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"have been here few times, always ok, last time is a downer. the lady at the bar was rude, the drinks were not served for a long time (and she brought them from another bar in the venue, although we were sitting at the bar she was in), music is very so so.",2,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
the best cocktails we had while visiting london! this hip bar feels like a cool speakeasy. i would strongly recommend the experimental cocktail club for a post show drink (near theater district). ,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
loooooovvvvveeeeeeeee,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
behind an unmarked door you find one of the best cocktail bars in london. busy on peak days but if you go at a less conventional time you'll find it very relaxing and a fantastic place to enjoy amazing cocktails and chat the afternoon/evening away.,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"you have to know what you are looking for, otherwise you won't find it. inside it is stylish and across the different floor you'll find a spot to sit. staff is very knowledgeable and cocktails are 5*, but maybe just slightly overpriced. but it'd definitely go back",4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"they know their cocktails, and if you ask for a classic that's not on the menu they will make it. i recommend an old fashioned! it's a bit pricey but well worth it. look for a bouncer in front of an unmarked brown door next to the four seasons, a hidden gem in chinatown!",5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"i like that ecc is hidden in the middle of chinatown, where you would least expect such an establishment. from my experience it's fairly easy to get in on weekends too, if you're a group of 2-4 people. i've been to this place at least three times, and cocktails are consistently excellent, albeit over-priced for what you get. ",3,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"nice ""hidden"" bar in a speakeasy style decor. great selection of cocktails, with a combination of both good classics and inventive house cocktails. all cocktails ordered were very nice, however they are a bit pricey.",4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"this has a bit of a 'secret door' vibe as there's no exterior signage.  instead you need to 'find' the doorman and have him let you in.  cocktails were fantastic, but the interior was a bit dated.  i'd go back, but i wouldn't mark it a must-do.",4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
quite pretty inside and possibly better than milk and honey in that regard. cocktails also tend to be yummy and feel like they've been delicately prepared. however the novelty seems to outweigh the actual overall experience. the door staff can be unfriendly and rude and the cocktails aren't quite worth the hype. ,3,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
it's a bit of an adventure to find this small unmarked door along gerrad street but negotiate your way past the guarded door and you'll find two floors of a great speaking easy style bar. the cocktails are finely crafted and there's usually some decent music being played further upstairs. good fun and a nice place to bring friends. ,4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"06.11.2018: good cocktails, but worst service ever! super unfreindly, would not recommend to go there!",1,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"great place to kick in a party, with fairly good cocktails. expect a lot of people, loud house and electronic music and just a few tables. ordering can be challenging. rated three since they charged us 5 to go in and cocktails are 11 average, hence not that cheap.",3,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"pretty good and not much to fault although, a bit small and pricey.",4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"nicely surprised, not cheap but decent drinks",4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
great cocktail bar with a really cool opium den vibe interior. the service was great and the cocktails where made with real care and attention to detail. i will 100% be coming back again.,4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"some of the best cocktails i've ever had in london, which is saying something as i drink a lot of cocktails in london! don't be intimidated by the shabby doorway, the staff are friendly and the decor is beautiful. definitely worth a visit for a treat or celebration! ",5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
cute speakeasy tucked away in chinatown.,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"from the random doorman outside the small unremarkable door to the dark insides this place oozes charm and it finds a good crowd with the young and well-dressed. one thing to watch out for with this ""mystery"" place is the high prices! the strong drinks probably make up for it in this regard however. ",3,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"ive been going to this place for years. but now the novelty has worn out. also they discriminate. i was outside queueing, they turned away a older couple, they said sorry we are very busy, then two minutes later they let me and my friend in. absolutely out of order.",1,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"not so secret anymore, but still thoroughly enjoyable.",5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
great place for a few cocktails.  so many unique  drinks on the menu.  service was really good as well.,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"speak easy style bar. no jazz in site. cover charge to get in, absorbitantly expensive drinks. rude door staff. some of the wait staff were perfunctory. it was absolutely rammed.",2,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
great music and cocktails. great place for an intimate night out,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
felt rushed even ordering a bottle of champagne as they wanted to turn tables quickly on a saturday night,2,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
delicious cocktails. try the one with pandan leaves...,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"best laphroaig old fashioned: ""sky is the limit""",5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown

"cocktails were very poor and while waiting for me to finish me drink my mate ordered a quick beer, that set him back 7!! and a i had a broken chair ",1,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"nice looking place and friendly staff, but the menu (refreshed daily mind) was rather simple and a bit disappointing for a specialist cocktail place - not experimental at all!",4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"great drinks, the atmosphere was slightly peculiar but after a few of their delicious cocktails i didn't care. we will return when we're next in the area",4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
excellent drinks. can be packed at time. large groups difficult to get in.,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"cool drinks, cool place, 101% suggested! crowded on saturdays!",5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"extremely rude door staff.  would not myself and a friend into the bar,  with no valid explanation ,  my friend was black. i have entered the bar previously,  but will not return to bar with what i can only assume are racist door staff.  avoid. ",1,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
great cocktails. place is rather small and can feel crowded. overall a good experience and would go again for a drink,4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"very cool bar, very hidden away in chinatown. quite a struggle to find it which was half the fun! ",5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
lovely cocktail and my guest absolutely loved this place.  friendly clientele.,5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
it's ok. very odd door to get into the place with some guy waiting outside for customers. very expensive drinks! other than that it's ok.,3,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
nice cocktails in a relatively chill atmosphere.  i appreciated the 90's music the dj happened to be playing as well.,4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"great cocktail bar! intimate, friendly atmosphere, good music & top notch drinks. bar manager wilson & his staff were all excellent. highly recommend epp. ",5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
cocktail bar in the heart of china town playing relaxing vibes,3,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
really cool atmosphere and interesting drinks. when we were leaving they were just setting up a place for live music - very nice!,4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
decent cocktaillist,4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"nice bar behind an anonymous door. original/good cocktails. go on a calm night, tends to get corwded otherwise",4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"the way they make the cocktails is a work of art! a little more lenient than your typical speakeasy, so it gets a bit crowded. but the drinks were super tasty and worth the only slightly premium price tag.",5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"love the idea of a speakeasy that's difficult to find, but when asked where we would like to sit, we were then told where we could actually sit.... and the cocktail that was recommended by staff as being sweet was actually quite a bitter, coffee tasting cocktail... very expensive for what it was!",3,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"unexpected trendy bar, right at the heart of chinatown. look for an inconspicuous door that's under guard by 1-2 bouncers. the bar is split over two floors, can get very busy and drinks don't come cheap, but hey it's a hidden bar on top of chinatown - so it's worth it.",4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"i love this place. does get too busy on friday evening and weekends, but on a quieter weekday, it's perfect. ",5,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"quite hard to get into, bouncers only allow in couples. once in, it's cosy and drinks were lovely but expensive. atmosphere is good but be prepared to have to talk quite loudly. ",4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
the cocktails being expensive is expected. the small bar is best visited on one of the quieter nights to avoid loud music and consequently able to have a conversation.,4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"very rude doorman, let a couple in before us without asking them for a reservation yet asked us if we had one, which we did.  then when we got up to the bar and the same couple are on our table!!  drinks were good but this place is not worth the hassle or hype, will not be coming back here again.",2,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"terrible,was expecting a better service from a place pricing itself to be a well to do establishment. was not allowed to sit together as a group of people due to some silly policies... rude staff ",1,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
"host just decided to randomly  charge entrance fee. when asked why, he decided that people are not worth respond and asked next people in queue to come in. i was a regular client and i am never coming here again... poor poor service...",1,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
great cocktails in a private and discreet bar with a classy ambiance. i liked the la medicacion and the get the buck in here drinks. it gets crowded after 1230. ,4,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown
very average drinks and then charged the optional 12.5% gratuity. youve gotta do much better if youre going to call yourself a cocktail bar.,1,Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown

"absolutely mega dim sun and let me tell you, i don't take my dim sun lightly. i remember the first time i had dim sun, it made me weep salty tears of joy as i gnawed away my woes with a porky ball of happiness. far east chinese dim sun made me cry with such happiness i got thrown out.",5,Far East Chinese

we always eat at gerrards corner when we are in chinatown. food is great but service can be patchy. avoid 12.30 - 2 pm when they are desperately busy. they serve dim sum until 5 pm.,4,Gerrard's Corner
"always busy but extremely delicious dimsum with reasonable price!! totally worth the queue so i dont mind coming back every now and then, staffs are busy but always try their best to accommodate guests. definitely recommended, especially the prawn dimsum",5,Gerrard's Corner
steamed dumplings and deep fried dumplings were the best in soho. staff were friendly and welcoming. service was quick and efficient. the only drawback were the custard steamed buns got a bit messy as filling is a little too runny. apart from that they are the best restaurant in chinatown by some distance.,5,Gerrard's Corner
"rip off !! avoid. i am asian. they thought we were tourist so begging us for tips although service charge was already included. they told me 'that the way we do it here' lol. if this is the way this restaurant is managed, management should be ashamed of themselves.",1,Gerrard's Corner

"mediocre food at best with ok service. totally shady unitemised bill and they very insistingly tried to collect service twice. only when we insisted, they showed us the itemized bill and claimed that the 12.5% is part of the food price",1,Gerrard's Corner
best cantonese restaurant in london,5,Gerrard's Corner
"food not that great, appears cheap outside on the menu and then they smack the 12% gratuity on for just slamming plates on your table. hand written receipts with no break down of prices or drinks showing. i wont be going again.. they also come across rude when challenged about the price hike.oh and the prawn crackers are stale.",1,Gerrard's Corner

"great food, great service, great place ",5,Gerrard's Corner

"great place to eat, fast device and tastes great. would definitely come again",5,Gerrard's Corner
worse customer services i have ever come across!!!  the girl who handed our bills should be sack!!  damn rude and grumpy.  am surprised the business still going having employed people like her.  and whats this 12.5% is a must??? i thought its up to the customers and not the management?,1,Gerrard's Corner

"terrible, terrible food, rude staff, and tried to sneak a 20% service charge onto the bill by providing only a final number (with no breakdown) and then on top asked for another service charge! do not go here. there are so many much better places right next to it.",1,Gerrard's Corner
"food tasted horribly of chemicals, i was sick after i had a few bites of an unidentified meat in dim sum, and the service was extremely poor. no itemised bill either. never going back there and actively discourage people from going as well. this place ruined my day.",1,Gerrard's Corner
waitress tried to subtly add additional service charge on top of the 12.5% discretionary charge already on our bill when we asked to split the bill  among ourselves. dim sum was ok but wouldnt recommend due to dishonesty.,1,Gerrard's Corner

it is relatively cheap in london. good food reasonable price.,5,Gerrard's Corner

"if you can, try to get a table downstairs. it's like a whole new world down there with dim lights, music like karaoke and great atmosphere for couples night. their dim sum is something to look out for at lunch time. i do find that they have better options on the menu for that.",4,Gerrard's Corner
do not order chicken fried rice. practically no chicken on it. or anything else for that matter. no flavor and poor service.,1,Gerrard's Corner
service charge which they inform you about after you have order yours drinks . they should inform this before you get your table . i don't have a issue paying service charge if you get good service . but don't like to be informed if you don't pay service charge we ask you to leave as this is part of our wages .,2,Gerrard's Corner

food was ok but they tried to steal my friends phone. after leaving the phone at the restaurant they claimed it was not there and only returned it the next day after being shown gps tacking that it was still there. very unprofessional bordering on theivery,1,Gerrard's Corner
"food was good but then they included, without saying, over 25% in tips. receipt said nothing. staff were also in a rush - not very friendly.",1,Gerrard's Corner
good food. little bit more expensive than some of the nearby restaurants. beer and some spirits available. usual grumpy staff expected in china town lol.,4,Gerrard's Corner

"superb meal, thank you",4,Gerrard's Corner
"food is good however there is a 12.5% service charge and then the waitress tried to get us to give her a tip on top of that. apparently the manager takes the 12.5% service charge! also they hide it by not giving you an itemised receipt, they give you a piece of paper with your total.",3,Gerrard's Corner
best chinese in london. just becareful. they add the tip in to the bill at the and do not tell you. then you add more not knowing. but good chinese,4,Gerrard's Corner
"surprisingly good restaurant in the heart of china town. we've had a pecking duck, dim sum, and some sides and everything was very good.",4,Gerrard's Corner
we were told we could only order once so they could keep turning over the table. the food was ok but not spectacular.,3,Gerrard's Corner
"i had a better meal here ages ago. it's a pretty basic chinese restaurant. the taste for the dishes were fine, but the portions have really diminished in size.within 5 mins of paying our bill, we were asked if we could vacate the table so they could bring in more customers- never a good way to impress anyone.",2,Gerrard's Corner
"not good, food is below average, better choices in area",2,Gerrard's Corner
"been here a few times now. it's our 'go to' place for chinese food when down in london and in the west end. food and service is acceptable. still think our local chinese takeaway in glasgow,  the cathay cuisine is my favourite!",4,Gerrard's Corner

great place. reasonable prices,5,Gerrard's Corner
"be aware - price scamthey will charge you additional 12,5% for eating in without telling you (on top of the 10% service charge). it is not mentioned in the menu which is deceiving. the food is ok, however i would strongly suggest to give up this intransparent pricing methods in the future. until then they wont see us again.",1,Gerrard's Corner
excellent food as  before will come again,5,Gerrard's Corner
"disgusting. overcooked and over fried dishes it seems like eating cork. perfect if you want to eat bone and don't really have taste. we waited 65 min!! for the dishes and there was not a simple apology. of course, a 10% extra because their good job ;)",1,Gerrard's Corner

great cantonese food and friendly service,5,Golden Phoenix

rudest staff ever. took our order whilst staring at us the whole time with the nastiest look on her face taking out her note pad with such effort only to be told that my friend and i's order wasn't enough? she then said 'bye then see you next time'. such a beautiful restaurant with such tragic personalities.,1,Golden Phoenix

third xmas meal brill every time.,4,Golden Phoenix
delicious food and great service.,4,Golden Phoenix
"i had dim sim here recently and the food was nice. the dishes range from 3.5-6.00 and there's a lot of dim sum to choose from. the service was a bit rushed but the atmosphere of the place was pleasant. i would eat here again, however there are a lot of places to choose from in chinatown which are just as good.",3,Golden Phoenix
decent dim sum so cannot complain. just don't expect a brilliant customer service - typical chinese service as you'd expect!,5,Golden Phoenix
"an authentic hong kong yum cha palace in soho.  all the food was excellent, the service was fast and friendly.  if they had packed the doggy-bag for us they would have got the 5th star.",4,Golden Phoenix
overpriced and not worth the money. service and food was not very good overall.,2,Golden Phoenix
"the golden phoenix provides authentic chinese cuisine in an atmosphere that is not cramped, and a cut above most of the other restaurants in the area. you may have to pay a small premium per dish over others prices, but in my view, it is well worth it for the comfort and quality.",5,Golden Phoenix
scrumptious food,5,Golden Phoenix
i popped in here on chinese new year. to be fair this place is geared to turning over alot of people. we didn't book but managed to get a balcony table after a couple of minutes. the food was nice but i have had better take aways. however it's a great location in chinatown ,3,Golden Phoenix
large well decorated restaurant right in the centre of chinatown. tables are well laid out meaning not cramped on your table. food is reasonably priced and over all very good.,4,Golden Phoenix

i would recommend this over most other restaurants in china town,5,Golden Phoenix
good food and atmosphere.,4,Golden Phoenix
absolutely awful response to our daughter's allergy.  waited until after sending tea order before listening that we had a nut allergy.  refused to serve her and then charged 8 for the unconsumed tea.  we were embarrassed and forced to leave.  never seen that before.  how mortifying!,1,Golden Phoenix

"good food, not as cramped as the other restaurants in china town",4,Golden Phoenix
dim sum s ok.,3,Golden Phoenix
"unfortunately, i really cannot recommend this place. what we had was not good, for example,  my dish hat a boiling hot broccoli and cold peas in it. most disappointing was the service, all of them appeared annoyed we asked something, even suggestions on how to combine sides with some main dishes. we felt totally underappreciated",1,Golden Phoenix
good food but like so many places in chinatown these days not cheap due to the increasingly high punitive rents charged by commercial landlords in the area and the punitive business rates.,5,Golden Phoenix
preferred restaurant for the chinese community. excellent service and great tasting food. lovely,5,Golden Phoenix
had a very good meal here busy but not annoyingly so reasonable pricing for london,5,Golden Phoenix
good foods and services ....,5,Golden Phoenix
its was excellent quality. the best chinese food i tried in uk,5,Golden Phoenix
let's start with entrance it is not easy if you have a pushchair or a wheelchair to get into the restaurant. staff looks a bit serious maybe becuase they are so busy . menu doesn't have any picture so for who doesn't know about the chinese food is very hard to choose. food quality is above-average.,3,Golden Phoenix
worst experience. we have ordered sweet and sour chicken and we got half chicken half beef. the soup i ordered and the noodle chicken was tasteless. i would have paid only 3 pounds for it but unfortunately real price was 32 pounds for 2 main dishes and 1 soup.,1,Golden Phoenix
"this place does/did sell shark fin soup, it can kill you because of the heavy metals",1,Golden Phoenix
great service. excellent food,4,Golden Phoenix

"large and in the heart of china town. has a good selection of dim sum plus the usual staples. probably somewhere you'd only go as a tourist, but a reasonable find.",4,Golden Phoenix
probably my favourite in china town,4,Golden Phoenix
lovely meal,4,Golden Phoenix
all though the lobster in spring onions was vey tasty the rest of the meal not very good. duck in blackbean sauce too oily and fatty  the chicken in lemon sauce was dry and was not fresh. very disappointing. they did change it for me to something different. very expensive poor quality food,2,Golden Phoenix
rude staff.,1,Golden Phoenix
been here a few times. had some good food but last couple of times service has been poor. items just did not arrive. even when chased they still did not arrive.,2,Golden Phoenix

must eat food when in london.. love it!,4,Good Friend Chicken
the best bubble tea in town.,5,Good Friend Chicken
love it! i recommend the popcorn chicken and fried sea food. you can choose your own seasoning on it. really good taiwanese snack place. queue can be long at times. the chips were disappointing though.,4,Good Friend Chicken
"love this place so much, the plum powder on the popcorn chicken is one of the best. don't get me started on the chicken slab, simply amazing and worth the price",5,Good Friend Chicken
"i tried the popcorn chicken and the fried chicken.  i let them pick which seasoning.  a combination of tomato, cheese, and garlic on one was excellent.  it was very busy, but fast service.",4,Good Friend Chicken
most of the chicken taste good but would not recommend the large drumsticks; they are quite bland once the skin comes off.,3,Good Friend Chicken
be careful of the chicken breast. i took a hard bite and some burning oil went up my right nostril which left me crying for 2 minutes. otherwise good tasty chicken with a wide selection of seasoning.,4,Good Friend Chicken
terrible work condition but great chicken.,4,Good Friend Chicken
so tasty! bit of a wait but you get a good portion for the price. will definitely be coming back.,5,Good Friend Chicken
"delicious chicken, not greasy, very tender and juicy. also i had the taro cold tea with boba and it was delcious !",5,Good Friend Chicken
the popcorn chicken is great,4,Good Friend Chicken
"the chicken meat itself is disgusting, i cannot pinpoint the pungent smell.. the thigh tastes like innards and overpowers the fried crust. i shudder to think where they source but the price is daylight robbery for such poor meat.",1,Good Friend Chicken
their fried chicken is perfect!,5,Good Friend Chicken
the crispiest chicken i've ever had,4,Good Friend Chicken
amazing chicken! the different selection of deep fried chicken or seafood coupled together with the different sprinkles options you can get make this place a must go for chicken lovers.look out for the sweet potatoes...they're huge!!!!,5,Good Friend Chicken

"good fried chicken, nothing else to say but you must try it.",4,Good Friend Chicken
"it was okay but ive heard a lot of rave reviews that im not sure it warrants. i had the popcorn chicken, which was a bit dry. the seasoning powders were nice but i needed to ask for more as you need quite a bit for it to be flavoursome. i probably wouldnt bother going again.",2,Good Friend Chicken
good deep fried chicken with great seasoning options. busy but fast service,4,Good Friend Chicken
big piece of chicken and big pieces sweet potato. excellent herbs and spices selection. seating is limited.,4,Good Friend Chicken

"best fried chicken ever. the batter is the best, the chicken is also freshly fried. the seasonings are large in range which helps diversify flavour. the pricing is pretty good although it is increasing slowly. their bubble tea is also really nice, although i would not recommend the fruit teas compared to the milk teas.",5,Good Friend Chicken
popcorn chicken here is amazing. golden and crispy !,4,Good Friend Chicken
food fired chicken. slightly expensive. i recommend getting the plum seasoning on your chicken.,4,Good Friend Chicken
"amazing juicy fried chicken. good portion size, many different seasoning to suit your taste. always find myself grab one when i pop into chinatown",5,Good Friend Chicken
"loved their chicken popcorn, different seasoning available, and their volcanic chicken stuffed with cheese sinful and yummy ",4,Good Friend Chicken
service was poor and chicken wasn't that great. really dry and packed full of msg. not really worth the money and didn't taste like the authentic version in taiwan. good for a first try but i wouldn't really go back.,2,Good Friend Chicken
"it was basically unseasoned fried chicken with then some flavoured salt sprinkled on top; so the real winner here is the salt, some real good salt :)",3,Good Friend Chicken
just make sure you ask from the chicken skins to be extra crispy,5,Good Friend Chicken
"amazing value for money and a good selection of taiwanese fried chicken. my only problem is that they oversalted our food massively (but the salt is only added at the end, so you can always ask for less)",4,Good Friend Chicken

"my favourite fried chicken shop in the capital. tasty taiwanese, popcorn chicken is awesome, forget the stuff you get in kfc. plum and chilli seasoning gets those taste buds wanting more. only negative is the lack of seating and tired interior.",5,Good Friend Chicken
the fried chicken is nice but wont recommend the lotus root.,4,Good Friend Chicken
"i love the popcorn chicken here.  nice blend of chicken and crust.  i ended up stopping by three times during my trip.  their boba is kinda bland but the tea was good.  overall, try the popcorn chicken.  its awesome.",5,Good Friend Chicken

taiwanese style fried chicken with flavour shakers. it's good and i think lately they've been adding to the menu to give it some return custom value. it's good if you wanna try some taiwanese chicken.,3,Good Friend Chicken
tasty fried chicken but service always very slow!,4,Good Friend Chicken

"we were walking past and were drawn in by the lotus stem crisps on display - it did not disappoint! i've never eaten lotus stem crisps before and these were simply delectable. you are given an option of 10 different seasonings, i went with the garlic and thai seasoning. absolutely yummy- cant wait to go back.",5,Good Friend Chicken
"really good decent fried chicken, would definitely recommend. got the popcorn chicken (a massive bag full) and bubble tea for 9 - you can choose your seasonings too once they fry the chicken. would definitely come back again. i would get this over any form of takeaway any day.",5,Good Friend Chicken
"oof, really good fried chicken. lots of flavour shakers to add on top. everything is deep fried so it's not healthy but yeah, really tasty...",5,Good Friend Chicken

"a nice surprise in china town, london. just stick to ordering the fried chicken steak, no other pieces taste as good there say as a good popeye's chicken, but a good option for  trying a different assortment of sprinkled spice toppings to try on a fried chicken steak to go. surely, a must try in central london.",5,Good Friend Chicken
"loved the chicken popcorn and the sauce, best when served hot, halal place in london",4,Good Friend Chicken

hot pot's pretty awesome. me and the wife got a variety beef and the variety vegetable and it was way too much for us. also the spicy broth that they offer is way spicier than you might think. proceed with caution .,5,HOT POT Thai Cuisine

great selection of asian soup for hotpot.  enjoyed cocktials decent price,5,HOT POT Thai Cuisine
"waiter ask me 4 times if i am alone....i had tom yum kung soup with prawns, very good but the bowl comes half empty... one minor think also is that the bolted down tables are so much against the wall that you can't move an inch !",3,HOT POT Thai Cuisine
great food but staff were too busy to give us prompt service,3,HOT POT Thai Cuisine
"enjoyed the food, authentic thai. next time want to try the hot pot but didnt have time- the waiter said it would take at least 1-1.5 hours. looked amazing!",5,HOT POT Thai Cuisine

"read other reviews and understand why the feedback is good. the food is very tasty. the price is also very affordable. found out they are part of a thai based chain with more than 150 restaurants, so they know what they are doing! hope they open one near where we live in croydon.",5,HOT POT Thai Cuisine
i had much better thai food before. the ambience upstairs is good. i had much better thai cuisine when i've stayed in shanghai,2,HOT POT Thai Cuisine
high quality and fresh hot pot similar to what we tried in taiwan. service was also very good! staff were friendly.,5,HOT POT Thai Cuisine
"mediocre food, expensive bill, wiping your table even as you're paying",2,Haozhan
"the food was very below average and really overpriced. the belly pork was really fatty, there didn't seem to be any beef in the crispy beef, and the rice was cold. the crispy squid starter was the only good part. it came to 45 which is a massive rip-off for such low-quality food. will not be going back.",1,Haozhan
it was delicious!,5,Haozhan
good tasty food but i ate beijing duck that was suppose to be for two people alone and it still wasn't enough for me. the portions of duck could have been bigger and this is the only thing that brings down the one star.,4,Haozhan
we have seen the sign specialist of peking duck. but the roasted duck was not like the one of golden dragon. we want to try something els. service was oke only they have to improve there english.,3,Haozhan
friendly staff and great food! their dim sum and duck are both very nice. i have no idea how they got some of the bad reviews.,5,Haozhan
food was good and serving was nice. however tables are crowded. there is even a table under a bar,4,Haozhan
"hubby and i were craving dim sum, but weren't able to go during the daylight hours.  we walked by this place after seeing a play and saw they had a late night dim sum menu with the main staples. everything we ordered was delicious, and service was quick and friendly! we will come back here the next time we visit london!",5,Haozhan
"very rude waitress. told us to leave when we were still enjoying our tea after our meal (we paid 4 for the tea). she told us many people were waiting downstairs and we had to leave. when we went downstairs theres no queue, in fact theres no one waiting at all.",1,Haozhan
"very good food, only missing szechuan duck ont he menu, otherwise perfect",5,Haozhan
"food was amazing had starters mains and deserts and the custard dim sums blew us away, staff were friendly and very attentive will definitely be coming back when in london, coke was slighty expensive for my liking though all and all was a great visit and a lovely restaurant.",5,Haozhan
decent dim sum. very busy atmosphere. fun people watching and meeting strangers if you are up for that sort of thing.,4,Haozhan
"average food, average service.",2,Haozhan
amazing.,5,Haozhan
good food.,3,Haozhan
nice chinese!,4,Haozhan
very good chinese restaurant,5,Haozhan
we really enjoyed the food/meal that we had in the restaurant but found the service appalling. staff we too quick to try to take away food not yet finished & bought out some of the meal far too quickly.,3,Haozhan
best duck ever!,5,Haozhan
excellent dim-sum!,5,Haozhan
meant to be the place to go for duck in chinatown. dont bother. we ordered half a roast duck which came out with gravy poured over it with the skin limp and just not edible. stir fried mixed vegetables were also bland and when i bit into a mushroom there was a hair attached to it.,1,Haozhan
"ok, same as the rest of the chinese restaurants in town. have yet  to find one that's extra special aside from the one in nuneham courtney.",3,Haozhan
"awful experience - very poor food, rude and argumentative staff. should have known better when i saw how filthy the kitchen was on the way to the loo and left straight away!lots of good restaurants nearby... avoid this one!",1,Haozhan
"lovely restaurant, the duck & pork were fantastic, glad i stopped in",5,Haozhan
"great food, good service, great atmosphere!! tried their duck, mixed meat egg noodles and coconut prawn soup(the last was out of this world), strongly recommended!!",5,Haozhan
great dim sums!,4,Haozhan
in a middle of the tourist mess of the london china town :)inexpensive. fast service.feels like 4*- or rather 3*+.but tastes more chinese. maybe because of only chinese ingredients used.,4,Haozhan
"good food, friendly staff.",4,Haozhan
very tasty. nice experience to eat in chinatown.,4,Haozhan
their dim sum is really good,5,Haozhan
service and attitude are bad but still cost you 12% service charge.  food is cold. chicken is raw. coca cola is expensive cost 3.,1,Haozhan
"tasty food, good value and service.",5,Haozhan
best handmade dim sum in london chinatown! good service and very tasty food. i will definitely be returning here,5,Haozhan
"the roast duck is not very good,  some older bits mixed into the portion, and not cheap.",2,Haozhan
"overrated. i've visited multiple chinatown restaurants across the globe, and was very excited to eat here. outside of the spicy pork dumplings, everything was disappointing. save yourself time and money, and go someplace else.",2,Haozhan
"popped in here with a friend for dinner and ordered the crispy duck sharer menu. everything was freshly prepared and absolutely delicious. perfect crispy duck, sumptuous dim sum, and two meat dishes to finish. plenty of great food for a great price. absolutely recommend.",5,Haozhan
not worth the price plus they only give you one scallop which is ridiculous! waiter was rude also but the noodles were alright,2,Haozhan
the porridge / congee was good. we also had some vegetables/ seafood dimsums. my friend had the roast duck. maybe a bit pricey; for what it was.  food was delivered fast though,3,Haozhan
"my most favourite chinese restaurant in china town. very good roasted duck, not too sweet sauce.",5,Haozhan
"if u're ready to wait outside like 25min, come !food is great, and generous ! a bit expensive though",4,Haozhan
good value for central london. portion sizes are average. the meals themselves were generally quite tasty although nothing special.,3,Haozhan
decent food. liked the crispy duck and the dim sum. waiters are hectic.,4,Haozhan
"good dim sums,  crispy duck and veggies.",4,Haozhan
delicious foods. my favourite place in china town,5,Haozhan
"we had booked another restaurant before a comedy night but it was closed and needed to eat quick. walked into chinatown and found this gem, we had a set menu which was fantastic and good value.",5,Haozhan
"mmmmm we got the crispy duck, it was amazing!!!! we got a bunch of other things too and it was all delicious. great service.",5,Haozhan
"2 stars because the food was good. but with poor service, add stuff that you never ordered on your bill which they need a couple of tries to sort it out and then they force you to tip them without giving you any heads up before you order. i mean why would they care about good service if they force you to tip them anyway?",2,Haozhan
"quite nice dim sum in london. soup dumplings were almost like the real thing, great flavor",4,Haozhan
used to like this place as it has good food and never too busy. now the service has gone really downhill to a point they are just plain rude to customers. in chinatown there are plenty of other places offering the same food with better service. i'll not be going to this place ever again,1,Haozhan
amazing crispy duck and crispy beef. authentic flavours. good pricing and nice staff,5,Haozhan
great selection of food. good service. got a table as soon as we walked in. it was after the lunchtime rush in the middle of the week though. a little pricey for just two people. the more the merrier i think. i think they have some tables upstairs setup for larger groups. well worth going just for the steamed sea bass.,5,Haozhan
we loved it here! every dish ordered tasted simply delicious. the duck and dim sum was amazing. the staff were brilliant with children and it felt so christmassy inside! thank you,5,Haozhan
"nice, clean restaurant. staff were accommodating and helpful. food was nice, but not a huge nunnery of options for vegetarians/ vegans.",4,Haozhan
"good food, good service, good price, best in china town.",5,Haozhan
really good food and great service,5,Haozhan
really tasty and value for money,5,Haozhan
amazing menu and attentive friendly service - but unfortunately the quality wasn't what i would have hoped for in chinatown.,3,Haozhan
chef's menu is much too expensive for what it is worth!,2,Haozhan
"excellent food, good service & very pleasant",4,Haozhan
"starters are a bit small in size, maincourse is decent in size and taste, service is below average.",3,Haozhan
very nice chinese food - had the set menu - was a lovely selection and very good value - superb duck,5,Haozhan
prices are fine for what servoce and food you get. service is fast and smooth. definitely worth a try if you crave for spm asian food. and the food itself is rich in flavour.,5,Haozhan
below average food and decidedly poor service. rice served on plates rather than bowls seemed odd.,2,Haozhan
ok food. good place for tourists.,4,Haozhan
very good food for affordable price,5,Haozhan
"it was busy and a little later so we tried it as it was busy, but i would avoid it if honest. everything was over-cooked, crispy/dry or tasteless. not the worst i have had, but far from the best.",2,Haozhan
not a place i would return to. not very welcoming,2,Haozhan
"food below average standard and not fresh either like take out from fridges, fairly overpriced for dishes. was charged 1 for water.",2,Haozhan
"like all things in chinatown, it took some exploring to find this place, but it is very good. prices are pretty reasonable and the food is great (gotta have the duck!). best advice i can give is go in a group of 3-4 people max - you would be waiting quite a while if you go with more than 4",4,Haozhan
espectacular roast duck dumpling and glutinous rice in lotus leaf,4,Haozhan
"really good food, but cramped setting.",4,Haozhan
quite nice peking duck! staff is very helpful,4,Haozhan
used to be best in chinatown. really gone downhill. lots of michelin stickers on door but food is really poor,2,Haozhan
food is quite good here. price is reasonable if you know what to order. the usual hong kong based dishes will be fine. the food will be up to mark. can't expect much for this price range. service can be improved typical of chinatown (except for high end) restaurants. it is just beside the 2 four seasons restaurants at gerrard street.,4,Haozhan
great dim sum just watch oot if ypu are english you get the right priced menu.,4,Haozhan
"been a regular here for a while and definitely the best dumplings in china town. they're extremely authentic, the sizes are perfect and all of them taste so different. faves are the cheun fung (prawns and the pork) along with the crispy duck. will forever be my go-to place in china town!",5,Haozhan
"great food, good service and reasonable prices for the area. dim sum in particular is well worth trying.",5,Haozhan

average food.,2,Haozhan
"fast service, great food and great value! ",5,Haozhan
they were supposed to accept taste cards on a sundays but when i visited they refused to accept because they'd rather save the tables for customers who didn't use taste cards.,1,Haozhan
set menu food wasn't bet good.,2,Haozhan
great place!!!!,5,Haozhan
"good cantonese dim sum , general dishes for dinner ok too , a tad dearrr service charges comparing to other nearby competitors ",3,Haozhan

always good dim sum at a good price. best to go with a big group and sit upstairs.,4,Haozhan

food was okay. not very good though. bit overpriced.,3,Haozhan
"always eat here if i'm in chinatown. great food. good, quick, no nonsense service. ",5,Haozhan
"delicious food, amazing atmosphere and reasonable prices.",5,Haozhan
"worst experience i have ever had. first time i have given a review too. the waitress was very rude, dumping the food on the table and walking off constantly. would have received better hospitality at mcdonald's. never smiled, much better restaurants in chinatown. ",1,Haozhan
really good restaurant for authentic chinese food. the roast duck is great. will be back for more...,5,Haozhan
food was ok-nothing special. service was good but then they try to scam you by adding service charge which is a discretionary 13.5% but charged at almost 40%!! may work for the unsuspecting tourists but not with me so pulled them up on it!,1,Haozhan
great and refined food. horrible service. we were pushed out of the restaurant.,3,Haozhan
"the best place to eat at chinatown: the food is delicious, especially the chicken and the dim sum; the staff is fantastic and the place is clean and cozy. i have become a regular and i am always welcomed with a smile!",5,Haozhan
we had the couple set and it was too much. i wish we had ordered just the crispy duck coz that was really good. the rest was nothing special. ,4,Haozhan
food is not freshly cooked...the raw vegetables are tired.,2,Haozhan
christmas!!!!out of the sudden they dont accept credit card anymore but only cash and triple / double their price!!!!chinese tea for 7.00 when they normally sell it for 1.00 !!!!not to mention the worst waitress ever !!!!! i met it there.,1,Haozhan
genuine chinese. try the crispy duck,4,Haozhan

fast delicious food. slightly cramped.,4,Haozhan
"average food. the sign outside said optional 12.5% service charge, though we were told that it was mandatory. also, we were charged 3.50 for prawn crackers we didn't ask for. ",1,Haozhan
"good food, nice dim sum.",5,Haozhan
cantonese restaurant serving main dishes and dim sum. price is fair but not really authentic in cantonese cooking style.,3,Haozhan
the food was okay. they want you to go to the cash point to pay cash. this is the first option and is pushed as the payment method. they only got card machine when asked.,1,Haozhan

restaurant in china town. good value and good food. everything is quite fast especially when they are busy. that's good of you have other things to do. ,4,Haozhan

"damn son, that's good dim sum!",5,Haozhan
"great 14 set meal , highly recommend.",5,Haozhan

food is nice and fair price. service is so so.,4,Haozhan
"the crispy chili beef is so tasty - with saffron rice, great pork rib soup and egg tarts to go!",5,Haozhan
"food was average, but the staff and service were very bad.  i wouldt recommend it.",1,Haozhan
did anyone else eat here around the 6th march 2019 and everyone got sick?,1,Haozhan
"i have lived in asia for more than 10 years and this is the best duck i've ever had! the other foods were pretty good, as was the service, but the duck was outstanding. highly recommended if you want duck.",5,Haozhan
really awesome experience here. very authentic and tasty dim sum. don't forget egg tarts!,5,Haozhan
"delicious!!! quick service with good staff, duck excellently cooked, crispy chilli beef the best i've had..crispy and melt in the mouth. very highly recommend this place.",5,Haozhan
"worst restaurant ever\ a viter absolumentbad service, bad food,  rude and agressive staff. they took back the food before we end it. and when they serve us the second type of food they told us that we only have 10 min to eat before they close the restaurant.",1,Haozhan
sometimes i come to pick up a takeaway container of pork belly. its quite tasty and the sauce they provide with it is a good accompaniment.,3,Haozhan
"a bit dark,tables are very closed to each other,nothing special for yum cha.",3,Haozhan
"excellent service and food. if you're an american, be prepared for a real experience as this is nothing like the ""chinese"" food to which you're accustomed, in a good way.",5,Haozhan

"nice place in london chinatown, they do really good deals.",4,Haozhan
"they kicked us out when we are still drinking tea, what a lovely service ",1,Haozhan
great service.,5,Haozhan

great cantonese / chinese cuisine. been there a fair few times now and dishes seem to be consistent.,4,Haozhan
highly recommend the roasted duck and bbq pork,4,Haozhan
great food great value,5,Haozhan
"overall food is okay. they really dont know how to make dim sum, especially soup dumplings just falling apart. raised it with the water and the new batch was as bad.",3,Haozhan
the roast duck was delicious - although it would be better if the sauce wasn't poured over the ducks skin to preserve more crispyness. the chinese broccoli with garlic sauce was nice but could have used a little more garlicy flavour.,4,Haozhan
food is good but service was lousy. not just bad. really awful.i went for the duck reviews. i won't go back.,3,Haozhan
"our party of 5 enjoyed a tasty and timely pre-theater dinner of crispy duck with pancakes and several vegetable sides with a slightly updated edge.  the waiter was gracious, knowledgeable and respectfully helpful.  while a bit more expensive than others in the neighborhood, the quality and consistency was well worth it.",5,Haozhan
"not all staff are very fluent in english, food was decent but nothing special",3,Haozhan
"lovely food, nice and warm friendly place",5,Haozhan
nice dim sum and congee. too much mei jin makes you thirsty. a little disappointed the restaurant charged me gbp4.8 plus 10% for a bowl of plain congee. this is supposed to be cheaper than a bowl of plain rice.,3,Haozhan
"great cuisine in the heart of china town.  there are many choices, but glad we selected haozhan.  if you like duck, they specialize in duck.  we ordered a variety of dishes and enjoyed each of them.  portion size and price were good.",4,Haozhan
so delicious,4,Haozhan
best duck in the world!,5,Haozhan
the duck was a bit dry and the waitress unfriendly. would not recommend.,3,Haozhan
not bad chinese food for the price but not outstanding either.,3,Haozhan
"excellent. been in uk for two years. among the better chinese restaurants. in contrast to four season and goldmine, service is way better. roast duck is comparable or even better!",5,Haozhan
"very good if you go for ordering dim sum to share. same price level as the restaurants around (even though the prices aren't posted on the menu outside, you will see them before ordering).much more cosy upstairs than visible from the street, so try to sit there if possible.",5,Haozhan
very delicious. the crispy pork is amazing.,5,Haozhan
amazing restaurant with the best dim sum in london. the staff is efficient and you get your food very quickly. love it!,5,Haozhan
"before entering we said we have a tastecard. while asking for the bill the cashier was the rudest woman i have ever met and denied the use of the tastecard, said we must speak to her before.horrible experience for a paying customer. avoid at all costs.",1,Haozhan
i thought it would be better. i had great expectations maybe.,3,Haozhan
stopped in for a set menu meal on our way to a show. great food at good value. excellent place for a quick pit stop.,5,Haozhan
"all was just simply ok, will i return no thank u.",1,Haozhan
"it's impossible to try every dish in one sitting so it could be hit or miss. but with the roasted meats displayed in the window you can't go wrong. the chicken, the pork and the duck, over plain rice, are outstanding. will be back to try more dim sum and hopefully add to this review. ",5,Haozhan
any asain foods you need get it here !,4,Haozhan
"great chinese, dumpling platter was fantastic, great duck pancakes too. also pork belly was very tasty and i'm not normally a fan of mains. good choice if you are in chinatown!",5,Haozhan
crispy duck? more like boring dry and uncrispy... expencive,3,Haozhan
one of my favourite places to eat bbq crispy skinned duck. i would go just for that!,5,Haozhan
really like the yam and sweet potato pearls!! what an awesome creation.,4,Happy Lemon
not bad. i prefer bubble tea then fruit flavour slush. service was fine. :),4,Happy Lemon
however the que system is not very good and at first glance you dont know where to que its all worth the wait. i definitely reccomend the lemon green tea on a sizzling hot day.,5,Happy Lemon
"super cute little shop, great milk tea",5,Happy Lemon
the service is fast. faster than a bullet train.  and milk tea was delicious as well. i ordered the mango and orange green tea which i recommend.,4,Happy Lemon
loveee happy lemon! my favourite drink is warm milk tea with tapioca and pudding.,5,Happy Lemon
"their bubble tea is more creamier tasting, and less of the 'tea' taste if that's what you enjoy then go for it. recently they've brought out some new snacks and cakes and they're amazing! make sure you try the crab floss cheesecake/sponge cake square thing. (i don't know what its called)",5,Happy Lemon
"my favorite milk tea so far in london. but i hope they allow their customers to use their own reusable cups. i asked before but was told it is against company policy. if coffee shops allow it, why can't they?",3,Happy Lemon
better than coco which recently opened 5 minutes away from here.,5,Happy Lemon
always the first place when visit london. iced bubble tea was good. staff were nice.,5,Happy Lemon
"i love sugar cane milk at happy lemon, it's sweet, tasty and so refreshing.",5,Happy Lemon
i enjoyed my bobba! it's was really good :),5,Happy Lemon
i only like one drink here. the classic lemon jasmine tea cold drink. its so refreshingly delicious for afair price. the place is too small and not comfortable for waiting.,4,Happy Lemon
such a shame that this cafe is so behind the times with its plastic use. not only do they sell their drinks in plastic cups with a non recyclable lid and straw but they also hand it out in a plastic bag!its awful. especially when you see that their customers leave their empty cups in the street.,1,Happy Lemon
"the tea was sooooooooo sweet nothing like chinese happy lemon, and the waitress was very very rude, no smile at all, wont go there anymore.",1,Happy Lemon
"love it!  great little bubble tea shop, i shall be back soon.",5,Happy Lemon
way too sweet. i was not asked the dose of sugar or ice unlike other brands. the waitress was not smiling at all.,2,Happy Lemon
was very tasty. just like bubbleolgy but i got bits of mango in my tea. didnt like that.,4,Happy Lemon
love love love! very nice bubble teas!,5,Happy Lemon
my personal favourite bubble tea joint up town. more fruity and a sensible amount of sugar!,5,Happy Lemon

"nom nom nom. standard ice tea, good.",5,Happy Lemon
"i usually go the bubble tea next door, but sometimes it's overbusy so i go to happy lemon instead. the quality is great, they have a lot of flavours but not everything is listed in the menu. their bubble teas are quite consistent, next time i'll try medium size.",5,Happy Lemon
was a 5,5,Happy Lemon
corrected my order with no fuss and no extra cost after i forgot to ask for tapioca pearls. very kind! also the bubble tea hear is top notch!,5,Happy Lemon
"everything is just a bit too sweet. tried the milk bubble tea and didnt have a say on the sweetness like other places and also tried the crepe cake. unless you like your crepes slathered in whipped cream, its nothing special.",2,Happy Lemon
"i have tried the classic bubble tea with tapioca which was really nice. the service was ok but i was quiet disappointed with the amount of ice that came with the drink. half the cup was filled of thick ice, no wonder it finished so quickly, that's not very good practice. i may give it another try without ice this time.",3,Happy Lemon
"lovely milk tea and tasty, soft and chewy tapioca. i only wish they added more tapioca pearls to my drink! service is fast and friendly.",4,Happy Lemon
"they got my order wrong: i asked for a taro milk tea and when i got it the tea was not purple and tasted like a normal milk tea! if theyd ran out id have rather been told than given one i dont like! service was fast however i wasnt asked what sweetness/ice level i wanted,",2,Happy Lemon
"loved their brown sugar boba, perfect amount of sweetness (for me). small place but fast service. we had to wait 15 mins because of the queue but it's worth the wait! surely coming back.",5,Happy Lemon
tried their oolong roasted milk tea and added pearl. the drinks was good but i find the pearl somewhat lacking. it will be great if they improve on their pearl,4,Happy Lemon
"me and my sister visited this place in the summer. taiwanese bubble teas made from freshly brewed loose leaf teas and using fresh organic milks. vegan-friendly soya, almond and oat milk options available too. we had the tea with the tapioca balls.",5,Happy Lemon
i have been going to happy lemon for as long as i have been happy. i am truly on my way to achieving eternal happiness.,5,Happy Lemon
"i'm always getting the cheesecake when i'm here, absolute treat! milk tea of all sorts are also great. a go to whenever i'm in london.",5,Happy Lemon
"a good choice of bubble tea on offer and the price is normal for london's bubble tea shops. the snow/cream cloud is delicious. if you like cheesecake, get it since it gives that kind of savoury/sweet taste.",5,Happy Lemon
a great place!!!,5,Happy Lemon
no trip to china town would be complete without a stop off here. great teas always busy but worth the wait,5,Happy Lemon
"went three times while in london. the red bean matcha smoothie is amazing and my favorite!! i recommend, however, this particular tea isnt for everyone but there are plenty of other options available.",5,Happy Lemon
"really good flavours, nice staff",5,Happy Lemon
always have a long cue whenever i come by but everything is worth it once i have my favourite drinks.,5,Happy Lemon
this place remains one of the best boba milk tea in london. quite small and crowded.,5,Happy Lemon
great place,5,Happy Lemon
"yummy milk tea and cheesecake. its a bit let down by the staff, since there always seems to be a lot of them crammed behind the counter and they talk among each other a lot, distracted.",3,Happy Lemon
"my favourite bubble tea place of those around in central london. similar price, but larger choice and nicer teas available.service is friendly, although there can often be queues outside.",5,Happy Lemon
one of the better tasting bubble milk tea places ive been to! various variety but i cant speak for the fruity ones as i stick to my milk-teas.,5,Happy Lemon
"the classic milk bubble tea is nice, but a girl staff is quite rude. felt disappointed in the attitude of the staff!!",1,Happy Lemon
good milk tea.,5,Happy Lemon
huge range of bubble tea flavours! was a bit sceptical about trying the taro flavour but im so glad i did - the milk teas are creamy and flavourful and the tapioca pearls are cooked well. theres even a bench to sit on while you wait for your order.,5,Happy Lemon
nice milk tea. but need to wait for a while.,5,Happy Lemon
"it's ok, but it was neither happy nor lemony staff seem to not want to be there. good tea though, made from the tears or resentful staff... i jest",2,Happy Lemon
always great time. efficient staff!,5,Happy Lemon
"best bubble tea for miles, only place that stands toe-to-toe with this joint is the one two doors down but they seem to be out of a lot of flavours all the time. happy lemon is reliable, not crazy expensive and delicious, staff are friendly and resourceful but it wouldn't hurt them to expand the menu a bit, switch it up a bit.",5,Happy Lemon
"nice bubble tea in a crowded area. the japanese cheesecake surprised me, so smooth!",4,Happy Lemon
"worst customer services   i've been to happy lemon lots of time, the drinks are nice but all the staff are always rude to me, i don't understand why but they look angry all the time. even with london branch or birmingham branch.",1,Happy Lemon
a little slow but worth the wait. don't be fooled by the surrounding shops! there's a reason this one is the only one with a queue!,4,Happy Lemon
taiwanese taste!3.95(large),4,Happy Lemon
loved it!,5,Happy Lemon
great milk tea with a lot of choice.,5,Happy Lemon
love this place!! its worth it the wait!,5,Happy Lemon
"haven't drink their milk tea for a while and came back today for a large og milk tea with taro ball. not only they poured the faulty milk tea into mine, they mixed ""black pearls"" with taro balls. just realized when i opened it at home. very disappointed and not impressed at all.",2,Happy Lemon
"i asked for a taro milk tea but it had no taro taste, at all. after asking, they claimed this is their taro milk tea. i had taro milk tea many times before so i know how it tastes. i don't like when people think i'm stupid.the bubbles were not fresh, either, they were too hard and starchy in texture.",1,Happy Lemon
one of the cheaper bubble teas in london and its good too,4,Happy Lemon
"great tastes, can recommend for everyone",5,Happy Lemon
one of the best bubble tea in ukhighly recommend,5,Happy Lemon
"milk tea was tasty and creamy, but the asian lady at the cashier was very hasty, mean, and definitely no manners. i wish they had better customer service.",1,Happy Lemon
just order the taro milk tea with taro balls. trust me.,5,Happy Lemon
one of the best milk tea that i have in london. small tiny shop but quick service.,5,Happy Lemon
"quite good, pass it often whenever i go to london so i get it most of the time when at london. for avid bubble tea fans, no option to control sugar but you can control heat. got the mango milk tea this time, with a mix of popping boba and tapioca. mango tea tasted like regular milk tea, in my opinion. staff were quite friendly.",4,Happy Lemon
we were just asking about the cheesecake and the workers acted like it was so hard to reply. acting like were stupid. so we just left. why give your money to people who dont have basic manners.,1,Happy Lemon
always nice to grab a fruit tea here.,5,Happy Lemon
great classic bubble tea cold or hot(sometimes the hot isnt always hot but theyre usually happy to change it). they need to stop charging 50p to use the card machine on payments under 5! but other than that its good,5,Happy Lemon
bubble tea from here is the best in the world i would say,5,Happy Lemon
cheese tea = delicious!!!,5,Happy Lemon

really great! would recommend the hand crafted lemon black tea,5,Happy Lemon
some really good bubble tea and was a super cute place.,5,Happy Lemon
the milk teas here are great. they are sweet on normal sugar level so ask for less sugar. you cant even ask for less ice or no ice. i have tried the other fruit teas here and they do taste more artificial and overly sweet.if you go for a milk tea here you cant go wrong!,4,Happy Lemon
good service & value for money.,5,Happy Lemon
great milk tea and cheese cake.,5,Happy Lemon
hell yes best bubble tea,5,Happy Lemon
"the milk teas here are nice and tasty. there's no option to control the level of sugar in the drinks, though it's neither too sweet or bland. mainly tried the fruit flavoured bubble teas, which are delicious.",4,Happy Lemon
"quick service even on very busy day. coconut milk tea and mango green tea are my favourite one :). the shop is also very cute looking, definitely on my list of top places ti get a drink. would recomend it to socially awkward people just like me (no awkward moments or incidents in the time i have been there)",5,Happy Lemon

service was a bit slow as there was only one staff member working but was very friendly,4,Happy Lemon

i started to hate happy lemon because of this brunch !!! i dont understand why the taste of my (always the same order) doesnt taste the same? manchester stuff they know their work much better,2,Happy Lemon
"their cream crown style boba is honestly my favorite style of boba on the planet. the cream crown is lightly salted, which actually really works with a sweet tea or milk tea. my go to order is the classic milk tea with boba, but with the cream crown.",5,Happy Lemon
best bubble tea. delicious. the staff are very nice too. i'm a frequent customer,5,Happy Lemon
"fantastic! i went to the happy lemon yesterday, i tried the green tea with rock salt cheese which   is definitely my favorite one. it is so amazing! i never thought it would taste so good. very nice shop!",5,Happy Lemon
"big selection of bubble tea! i can never decide whether i like cuppacha or happy lemon more, so i just keep alternating the two. it's always pretty busy here, which i take as a good sign. pro tip: ask to adjust your sugar and ice levels (i always go for 'less sugar' and 'half ice' to cut down on the sweetness a bit)",5,Happy Lemon
"customer service is terrible. i asked what the salted cheese was about. she to pointed at the first list, i picked one...wasn't salted cheese...wasted my money",1,Happy Lemon

the service here can not be more rude. not only in the tone but also in their body language.,2,Happy Lemon
"as a taiwanese, i didn't like it at all. the drink was (i think) added with a lot of artificial flavor.",2,Happy Lemon
liked it overall though i won't be rushing back. the chocolate tiramisu boba was just chocolate milk. my friend's taro milk tea was too sweet and didn't really taste of taro at all. this place also lacks variety and the prices are a bit high. i prefer cuppacha next door.,3,Happy Lemon
standard little bubble tea shop. ,3,Happy Lemon

"best bubble tea place in london. would only go for the original milk tea though, other options are made with artificial flavors.",4,Happy Lemon

"this is definitely one of my favourite places for bubble tea (boba) in soho. i adore their taro however be warned most of the flavours are extremely high in sugar. oh and don't mind the queue it moves extremely quickly. my recommendation: taro milk tea, half sugar, ice and tapioca ",5,Happy Lemon

"all the food was as cold as the night king's heart, the service was as crumby as a gregg's sausage roll and the place was as filthy as a 40 a day smoker's lungs. but my tiger beer was just above room temperature, so it's got that going for it. ",1,Hong Kong Buffet
terrible food,1,Hong Kong Buffet
shitty food. there were still feathers on the chicken wings so i had to throw them away. and i felt that it was very overpriced. i would rather eat something more.. clean and delicious with the same price. also they charge you 10% service fee which i hadnt got any. ,1,Hong Kong Buffet
an all you can eat buffet and a good selection of items.,4,Hong Kong Buffet
the decor inside is pretty low quality. the food is bs - the a small selection and i ended up with food poisoning. they also add a 10% service charge even though all we said was two buffets please and please can we have the receipt,1,Hong Kong Buffet

"for 9.95 its pretty good. obviously its not upto the same standard as some of the more expensive restaurants, but the food was all hot on my visit and similar in standard to chinese take away type offerings. a decent selection considering its quite a small place.",4,Hong Kong Buffet

"excellent food, drinks, service and interior design! the atmosphere is magical.",5,Hovarda
so great,4,Hovarda
the venue has of the best designs and ambiances in london. the food is even better than the venue. hovarda is on the way to become a flagship restaurant of the aegean kitchen. crab borek is a must try with a bottle of raki...,5,Hovarda
food is delious champagne & cocktails they were lovely  staff were very professional & helpful i had a wonderful birthday celebcelebration tonight xx,5,Hovarda

"i love this place. lovely food, great ambience",5,Hovarda
excellent bar upstairs. on thursday's the bar is a scene with good looking londoners while a dj spins tulum house that tends to be boring after 10 mins.,4,Hovarda
the best greek and turkish restaurant in london,5,Hovarda
i love the vibe and the music!!,4,Hovarda
"avoid this place!!!!! this restaurant can be summarized in two words : zero professionalism. service level is the worst seen in london among trendy restaurants. food is disgusting. waiters are not waiters, manager is not a manager. chef is not a chef. dont waste ur time and money. this place will never make it and last.",1,Hovarda
whatever.,1,Hovarda
"one of the rare places in london, where you can buy alsohol after 1 a.m)",5,Hovarda
posh in the bad waygood sound system and that's it,1,Hovarda
really cool bar in a bustling part of town. the staff were great and made great drinks. it's expensive but all the nice places in the area are.,5,Hovarda
nice place good staff but the food isn't wow.,4,Hovarda
"disappointed, staff were not as welcoming as i had hoped",2,Hovarda
cool hidden gem in soho. it was a quiet night that still had a house dj.,4,Hovarda
"service is great, especially the hostesses. they were extremely friendly and accommodating although it was not the busiest night. the only reason it gets 4 stars is because the halloumi costs 16 which is outrageous. dj at 930 was such a great vibe.",4,Hovarda
"food ok, good ambience, busy at night. dont order the scallops, it costs 34 and you get 3 (yes 3) scallops. table service very average and relatively slow.",3,Hovarda
"love the vibe upstairs. top djs, good crowd. the insider in soho",5,Hovarda
very nice atmosphere and interior. the food is good and the set menu portions were generous.the service is on the slower side though and the music is always too loud.,5,Hovarda
"i absolutely loved it. a quite posh bar close to soho, with excellent house music. if i wanted to impress a date, that's where i would go. up to 11 on it also had more women than men, which evened out. definitely recommend.",5,Hovarda
very nice place to eat drink and dance after all (but not cheap),4,Hovarda
"very pleasant experience as always. delicious food with a curious twist. there is a new dj playing almost every day on the first floor. attentive, professional, friendly service. every visit is like seeing some good friends.",5,Hovarda
average brunch. overcooked steak. forgot our order (even though the place was empty). i had a great first experience there. but this one really took the bar down,2,Hovarda
cool place to hang out for drinks and food and cool music,5,Hovarda
drinks are super good and not pricey which is hard to find in a venue of that standard,4,Hovarda
"it is one of those places where you queu for a long time even though it is not full inside and there are lots of people leaving the place.. of course if you have the right posh look or know the right person, your experience might be different. i never made it inside and will never even try it again..",1,Hovarda
all staff very friendly the security is very very helpful and very very good person the lamb choops is very good the greek salad has too much tomatoes,5,Hovarda

wonderful bar on 1st floor,4,Hovarda
"this is the kind of place where i feel so well! cuisine, atmosphere, service, design & furniture, the energy... maybe it was just that night but it was perfect.",5,Hovarda
"an unique  mixture of balkan and mediterranean taste. the food is delicious! you can try some typical turkish and greek dishes,  served like tapas and seasoned with fresh dressing,  combining the full flavour of terra mediterranea. recently they have launched a brunch menu, which includes  unlimited glasses of spicy bloody mary. cheers!",5,Hovarda
"superb bar in soho! great cocktails, music and food!",5,Hovarda
"nice ambience, great greek and general mediterranean cuisine, good service.",5,Hovarda
"great cocktails. atmosphere brilliant when the dj is on in the bar. the interior design is great but i may be biased as lazaro is one of my favourites :-) the food is flavoursome, has differed each time i've been and the staff are very knowledgeable about produce and how each dish is prepared. will return again x",5,Hovarda
"i came yesterday for my birthday! the staff were amazing!!!!!! super accomodating! super friendly and really made the night fun, easy and special :) loved it. really appreciate the flexibility and the attentive service! music and food all amazing. i recommend the rib eye and octupus!",5,Hovarda
"funky, swanky restaurant/lounge with a mediterranean kitchen and great cocktails. velvet rope policy for when the bar gets busy a bit abrasive borderline rude",4,Hovarda
really good and tasty food! nice place,5,Hovarda
"fantastic food. beyond fresh and very creative, yet at the same time traditional, dishes. service was also great. quick with cocktails and meze. our main fish was a monk fish fillet for three. excellently cooked. the waiter was also extremely attentive. will come back.",5,Hovarda
"great decor and ambiance, terrible service! waiting over 20 minutes to get a menu, another 20 minutes to order, then 40 minutes to get our drinks! such a pity as the drinks were nice and the vibe is great. after another 30 minutes to pay the bill i am pretty sure i won't return. hopefully the restaurant service downstairs is better.",2,Hovarda
the food was amazing and the staff were very attentive with the bottomless prosecco,5,Hovarda
"too many people , i was waiting 20 min for drunk friday night. good music",3,Hovarda
great food and vibe! not the best service,5,Hovarda
"pretty average but pretentious bar: just another place that would make you queue outside to make it more desirable (old school trick). the manager would say (actually did) ""we are not obliged to serve anyone"". very unfriendly and rude staff starting from the door.",1,Hovarda
"great vibe, great food!",5,Hovarda
all thanks to yannick who gave us the best moments for tonight incredible was my birthday.. we're comming back really soon ,5,Hovarda
bouncers are rude and rediculous,1,Hovarda
worst place to have fun and eat,1,Hovarda
great interior and the lamb sovlaki is top. good atmosphere over lunch although the right side of the restaurant may be noisy with sound echoing inside.,4,Hovarda
"despite the pretentious nature of the place and the extremely high price for drinks the food is absolutely excellent, some of the best i have had in a long time. the service is ok, although don't expect to be treated too well here. go here for good food but don't expect much else.",4,Hovarda
stylish place with fine food and drinks. dress code is quite formal. the bar upstairs has a dj and its a perfect place to have drinks before going clubbing etc. the only downside is that they dont serve food at the bar after 9pm.,4,Hovarda
"delicious food and drinks, worth the visit!",5,Hovarda
"a perfect cocktail bar with amazing djs . the atmosphere is great and the whole stuff are very friendly. they have a wide bar menu. the prices are affordable. also, the ground floor is great to taste aegean food. don't miss this place if you like house music.",5,Hovarda
the food is average especially given the area and the service leaves something to desired.  there are  many better places to spend a few hours or pounds.,3,Hovarda
interesting fusion of turkish and greek. loved it.,5,Hovarda

"great ambiance, superb dj",5,Hovarda
no one goes here anymore,1,Hovarda
"food was good, but not exceptional and smart attire is strictly enforced. despite the attire rule, it wasnt particularly fashionable. good for corporate events, not great for an intimate, truly unique dining experience.",2,Hovarda
"vibe, crowd and dj here were all on point. we stayed until the place closed and had a great time",5,Hovarda
"absolutely stunning place , great food and the music upstairs is amazing ! try different starters and go also for one of the mains ! great interior !",5,Hovarda
"the guy in the door asked us if the company  we were waiting for are men or women. my question was why???? my friend (girl) respond  men and when he heard that, he turned his head from the other side and he said with irony  look ""don't look at me, we are fully booked"". totally sexistic and rude behavior in london 2019.",1,Hovarda
great greek food with a fun atmosphere,5,Hovarda
"way overpriced for what it is. 250for 3 with a bottle of barbaresco. 3 starters. 2 mains and a salad. the 400% mark up on all the wine really got to us, as did the overload and obnoxious music. its a sunday night. calm the tunes down and let folk pour their own wine. avoid.",2,Hovarda
super cool bar and restaurant with good looking clientele and great cocktails. the bar upstairs was really happening on a thursday night with people dancing in front of the dj and the bar being packed until 1am in the morning! definitely a gem of a bar and restaurant in a part of london that can either be too touristy or cheesy.,4,Hovarda
"excellent venue, not something you expect in a busy part of chinatown. classy, up market spot for drinks and dinner.",5,Hovarda
nice spot to meet friends when all places are busy. not cheap,4,Hovarda

fantastic food and good music. the venue itself is a must-see,5,Hovarda
an overrated place with rubbish service and management imposing deadlines on customers to finish food and kicking them out.,1,Hovarda
ridiculously overpriced for luke warm food and weak cocktails. service is beyond average and not worth 13.5%. pretentious and vacuous crowd.,1,Hovarda
"nice atmosphere, good food and lovely service.",4,Hovarda

great location and attentive staff.really nice menu.,5,Hovarda
horrible service & way too expensive.,1,Hovarda
"super yummy food and for the quality the prices are reasonable. food arrives quickly, staff is very friendly. music is very loud so it's you want a heart to heart that's not the place for it. it's suitable for fun night out. drinks are super good and not pricey which is hard to find in a venue of that standard. decor is cool.",5,Hovarda
"nice option for a night out in soho! loved the looks if it! be aware that it might get too crowded at times , but, hey, you are at the heart of london!",4,Hovarda

decent food. expensive but fine for the location. nice idea on foods of the aegean sea.staff were very much not on the ball that night. not a great experience when hosting a manager from the us.will prob not recommend,3,Hovarda
such a great vibe. the staff were so lovely and very welcoming. the music was great and the drinks were great,5,Hovarda
"felt thoroughly ripped off. 65 for bottle of ordinary cloudy bay, 16 for gin and tonic. main course from theatre menu smaller than starter and then ""discretionary"" 13.5% tip. two stars for food served being flavourful and convenient location but expect tourist ripoff.  have had miles better pre dinner menus elsewhere.",2,Hovarda
very friendly service. the party i was with were being difficult and the staff handled everything amazingly well. great atmosphere and cool music.,4,Hovarda

"little manu and not many options, but sushi is sooo good, so fresh. and is a lovely place with lots of japonse modern decoration around. plus toilet is futuristic hahaha",5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
good food and efficient staff. a bit too fusion for me but it's a personal preference and they execute well.,4,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"excellent service, delicious starter (mushroom gyoza), best noodles (veg udon) i've had in a long time. will definitely be back.",5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
quick service good price  ,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
the vegetarian burger (kakiage i think is the name on the menu) is amazing here!,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
i've been to many restaurants in london. this is by far the best! my all time favourite place to eat! i crave the dynamite shrimps on a daily basis ,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"i really suggest you this place if you are looking for an experience.staff is very nice, food is a combination between japanese and american (spring rolls off burger as example), and the music makes the perfect mix.",5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
easy 4 stars for me. it was really nice. food was good and staff were all very friendly and helpful.,4,ICHIBUNS SOHO

amazing food and a good vibe. definitely returning.,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"what can i say about this place that won't completely undersell it. live dj's, amazing fusion of cuisines and decor to die for. the price could be much higher considering its location and top level of food quality. the toilets are a must visit...",5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
had a great meal here. the food was excellent and the staff are fantastic.,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"good food, careful service, menu is a bit too limited and not as asian as the business name would suggest. central london prices.",4,ICHIBUNS SOHO

perhaps it is for the pop culture but i enjoy the burger and cocktails.,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO

great burgers. very 'gram'able location.,4,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"trendy ambience, but calling this place a japanese restaurant is a bit of a stretch.also the prices are quite steep - asked us if we wanted water and charged us 4 for the bottle without warning us.not desperate to come back again.",3,ICHIBUNS SOHO
great burgers  nice toilets that have a heated seat very small but all in all a brilliant experience.,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO

great diner feel to this place. some amazing dishes on the menu,4,ICHIBUNS SOHO
food was nice but pricey. only 4 stars because we had to wait a long time for the main courses of sushi platter and a hot noodle.,4,ICHIBUNS SOHO
this place is a gem!! the food is amazing... the location is instagram worthy for photos from the way the food is presented to perfection to the beautiful interior. the salmon burger was amazing!! if you love classic sushi and burgers with great flavour its a must visit! plus its open late too. will defo visit again!! and again!!,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"we loved this place. don't go here for traditional japanese food. go here for a relaxed atmosphere, great music, lovely staff and deliciously interesting modern japanese food. the hot udon with karaage was super tasty and everyone loved the crunchy veggie burger. highly recommended if you want something different.",5,ICHIBUNS SOHO

"amazing designed restaurant. the space downstairs, in particular, is stunning. very quirky  decor - feels very unique. quite a simple menu, nothing crazy exciting but all good quality - quick and tasty. great value considering the location and the restaurant's premium design.",4,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"this place despite not actually being an authentic japanese restaurant, it was a great fusion place. the wagu meat was great and you really cant order wrong on the menu, it was a descent price too. there was an amazing dish that can only be described as a cheeseburger in a spring roll that was so innovative and creative.",5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"the food here is great, as are the cocktails. really good quality, the toilets are great too! the only downside is service was very slow. however staff very good and accommodated my surprise cake idea for the hen",5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"wonderful restaurant with a great ambiance and friendly staff. the cocktails are amazing and so are the burgers. if you get a chance, try to visit the lower level.",5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
you would not suspect how cool is the inside. all the decoration looks like you are japan with traditional tables etc. loved the food but thought it was a bit pricey though. would definitely recommend!,4,ICHIBUNS SOHO
really happy with the food and service! wow gluten free crispy chicken! amazing. thank you lizzieee for being so wonderful and clued up on my allergy,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
i repeated my visit many times. amazing vibes and friendly staff! you should try out the burger if you love asian food dont forget to order gyoza veggie!,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"fast service, cool space. the food is fresh and flavorful. my only (small) nit was that the tempura chicken noodle dish was actually served as a soup. that didn't really work. noodles and chicken would have been much better if served ""dry"" style.",4,ICHIBUNS SOHO
i cannot recommend this place enough! food is a treasure! every bite is scrumptious! service is excellent. greeted beautifully and polish girl waiter was a treat.....atmospheric too,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO

"great atmosphere, very trendy. food was great a nice mix. we were in a rush as i had a show to go to. the food came out very quickly.",5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"the food is a blend of burger and japanese food. you could argue that neither is as good as a pure burger or japanese restaurant, which is true, but it kind of works. the food is tasty, the atmosphere is trendy and the service is quick.",4,ICHIBUNS SOHO
food great. music great. staff great. atmosphere great. must experience. highly recommended. will visit again.,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO

"good food, had an issue with our order but was quickly sorted out by management, was a nice touch.",4,ICHIBUNS SOHO
don't order the wagyu burger! they completely overcook the meat (some parts were burnt). complained to the waiter and they explained this is the way they do it. what a waste of good food!,2,ICHIBUNS SOHO
this is one of the coolest restaurants ive been to in the world. its in the heart of chinatown in london and a very good late night place to hang out and get delicious food. the price is reasonable and the service is excellent.,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
so wonderful interieur and very delicious drinks and food. also expensive but worth it,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
very nothing special food in the middle of china town. if you are in china town there's too many nicer restaurant is way better.,2,ICHIBUNS SOHO
really cool restaurant near china town. we had the wagu beef spring rolls and the burger both of which were fantastic. staff were helpful and friendly when we wanted to sit upstairs. well priced and would definitely go back!,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
loved the food and the design of the restaurant. downstairs there's a very cool pub isle.,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
used to pack more flavour. burgers now have to be fully cooked to satisfy the local authority.,2,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"wrong order, expensive, small portions. very simple food. the menu is very short. when i told the waiter that my order was wrong, he told me that i was wrong and he was right. i won't come back. the place is flashy and looks like a nice one, but it's a travellers trap.",3,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"such a coo place, interior design is fantastic, down to the lavatories. clean and well looked after. food was great and the service very friendly. great venue for business lunches or parties. will definitely come back, thanks to my friend patrick who reccomemded and showed me this gem in london's china town.",5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
a tad pricey for the food. the small bits pretty good. the buns are not as exciting.,4,ICHIBUNS SOHO

"the hostess, i believe her name is katy, was very rude and unwelcoming and was irritated simply because we asked for another table. for this reason we would not return. however the food was nice and our italian waiter was really nice and looked after us well.",1,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"not worth your money. burger and bun were super greasy.  67 for two burgers, soup and two appies. i get this is london but the burger was pretty small. trying to be trendy but failing.  much better places to eat.",1,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"japanese fancy place, cool music, great cool service and  tasty fusion japanese food. i do recommend at all.",5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"great food! the shrimp and chive gyoza were amazing. and the ume cocktail was a delight...even if i had them remove the egg white from the mix. on that note, they were happy to make substitutions, which is rare enough that i should mention it.",5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
great restaurant in the heart of chinatown in london. good food and service.,4,ICHIBUNS SOHO
great venue and decor.  food was just ok,2,ICHIBUNS SOHO
very nice food.,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"delicious. great atmosphere, delicious food. highly recommend the ichiburger. pricing very reasonable too considering it's central london.",5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
yum... really liked this place. initial seating wasnt great but moved to upstairs which we enjoyed. crispy rice and spicy tuna roll was yum but had to ask for wasabi. cheeseburger roll was nice... different but nice,4,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"the decor was the main reason i went, being a fan of showa era japanese things, the retro vibe made me excited. it was very nicely decorated. however, the food was... alright. my coke was flat, and i felt the ramen rather lacked vegetables and flavour.",3,ICHIBUNS SOHO
the food was amazing but small portions for the price. great vibe and funky decor!,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
great food and vibe!,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO

so good. really cool inside,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"great ramen, good sides, amazing burger. if you're going for the food you won't be disappointed. don't expect to sit and have a quiet dinner though there is loud music and a dark room for the dining area.",5,ICHIBUNS SOHO

great food but a bit pricey,4,ICHIBUNS SOHO

super nice food with polite stuff,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
tasty ramen & nice atmosphere,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"overpriced and not worth it. go to any other resteraunt around here. avoid at any cost. seriously, go to the bakery accross the street and a few doors down. get yourself 2 green tea ice creams in a fish shaped cone. you will be happier and only spend a few pounds.",2,ICHIBUNS SOHO
fantastic design and delicious food!!!,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"japanese hipster vibe cant cover for the average food, gyoza decent but the chips smelt awful and were clearly fried in very very old oil which made them taste off.",1,ICHIBUNS SOHO
expensive but totally worth it. food and decor are amazing,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
slow service on a weekday and the wait was not worth it for some pretty bland udon noodles.,2,ICHIBUNS SOHO

fun place to eat out with the family,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"kind staff, tasty food, awesome mochi! it is not really cheap, neither expensive, you usually dont pay more than 20, but it really is worth it.",5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"def not up to basic udon standards. ordered veg tempura udon, the noodles were so old and overcooked that they had no springy texture but mush like porridge. it didnt help the fact that the tempura were too greasy like they were cooked from old oil. would never pay 12 quid for that kind of udon again",2,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"love the details of this place. retro japanese inspired vibes. their best orders are sushi rolls, burger and burger spring roll.",4,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"weird door guy had us waiting outside with an half empty restaurant. food was ok, at best. looks cool though.",2,ICHIBUNS SOHO

"great surprise ! the atmosphere was great , the food was modern , fresh and with a twist ! definitely recommend!",5,ICHIBUNS SOHO

good food quick service reasonable prices,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
tourists trap. very overprice with very small and tiny portion and quantity of sushi for the price of a 45 pound menu. will never ever go there again.,1,ICHIBUNS SOHO

doorman was really rude. didn't greet us nice. lets you wait outside. say they have a table ready. yiu come inside. they ask everything all over again. food was mhoa. noodles didn't have a lot of tast. burger rolls were tasty!,2,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"best restaurant in london so far, i recommend their chicken karaage burger",5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"the biggest mistake you'll ever make is ordering their burgers anything more than medium, but i'm a midrare guy myselftheir sushi is great, one of their rolls aren't even on the menu, called the dragon roll, best one there in my opinion. i haven't had the noodles but apparently theyre really good i've heard",4,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"wow, just wow. friendly service, great internals, the burgers are from another planet. there's some kind of japanese udon meets american diner thing going and it's done perfectly. definitely one to seek out if you're a burger connoisseur.",5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"great atmosphere, great food, great for groups.",5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"food on point, ambience lively! quite a few fried options- which suits me well!",5,ICHIBUNS SOHO

must get the springroll cheeseburger,5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"it was for the company's christmas party, the atmosphere was great. we had finger food which was delicious but also enough to get full, and the cocktails were very refreshing. a big thank you to the ladies in service they were very attentive and always with a smile on their faces. ichiban team you smashed it thank you!!!",5,ICHIBUNS SOHO
"nice venue with retro decor and friendly staff. food appeared very saturated with fat (chicken bun). we also got charged twice for the desserts which were included in the kids meal offer, luckily we noticed it!",2,ICHIBUNS SOHO

"great service, nice food.",4,ICHIBUNS SOHO
the food is great however the staff aren't treated good enough with only having a short break after 10 hour shifts! i think management really need to fix up and consider their employees more as this is against the law. they get less than half an hour breaks for long shifts and this is unfair.,1,ICHIBUNS SOHO
great spot in soho. nice vibe and authentic menu,4,ICHIBUNS SOHO

it may look small from the outside but it's wonderfully spacious and decorated inside. there is a lovely koi pond and bridge by the entrance. normally very busy but can get seating. dumplings are very good and the sweet and sour is excellent. the noodles are average. rather pricey at about 50 for two people.,4,Imperial China
lovely restaurant.. ...the staff are amazing. the food was amazing. the staff got into conversation with us and discovered it was my partners birthday.....and surprised us with a scoop of ice cream with a candle. she sang happy birthday with me and took pictures for us. lovely atmosphere!,5,Imperial China

"terrible service, for which we paid a 12 service charge. food was average at best. avoid!",2,Imperial China
food was really good...i asked for a coke and it turned up when i got the bill at the end of my meal.  service could be better given the amount of choice in china town.,4,Imperial China
"food is always good... but after ordering the pepa tofu once and getting pork in the sauce, i asked for it without the pork the second time there as i dont eat it. the waiter assured me it had no pork in and when it came, it did - can you please not mislead customers as some people strictly dont eat pork.",3,Imperial China
very nice food and customer service,5,Imperial China

good food! recommended!,4,Imperial China
"quick business meeting over dumsums, service was quick, staff was pleasant and food was great.",5,Imperial China
": only go if someone else made plans & be mindful of what you orderthe pecking duck was fair however the other dishes (char siu, hot and sour soup, chinese broccoli, and pak choi) fell very short of the mark",2,Imperial China
"easy location to get to, decent enough food the service wasnt to great. may visit again when next in the area.",3,Imperial China
nice place tucked away off the main walkway which makes it more private and quite.good food but not cheap but if you like a little privacy in the busy china town area worth a visit.,4,Imperial China
good grease,5,Imperial China

reasonable food.. good prices at cntre of china town,4,Imperial China
the food is good but not worth the amount you are paying-quite pricey. staff were friendly and gave us an extra dish free of charge when they made a mistake (gave us the sauce after we finished eating it) with the original dish. nice ambiance compared to other chinese restaurants.,3,Imperial China
"reasonable chinese food, but service is somewhat rude. its plenty big enough for many people though, so you are safe to get a table.",3,Imperial China
"i hate to say this, but this chinese restaurant in the heart of china town has seen better days. i remembered it as been nice cozy with good food. but now food is so so and not particularly hot, in fact cold. not good.",2,Imperial China
"a bit of a find behind a subtle entrance. full of native chinese which is always reassuring. however, the food is hit and miss with only some dishes being good. needs a refresh, has become a bit tired.",3,Imperial China

"good dimsum, a little pricey",5,Imperial China
"no dim sum available, rude staff",1,Imperial China
this is my go to place in london for dim sum. served until about 4 ish.  after then they just offer a few basic dim sums.   the regular chinese food is ok but nothing super special. also great value.,4,Imperial China
"great food, good restaurant and the entrance is set back with a bridge and indoor pond with some huge koi carp. i've been coming to this restaurant for several years and i've never been disappointed yet. it's the only chinatown restaurant i will use now because out of the others i've been to, this one is miles ahead.",5,Imperial China
"really bad and bland food. i ordered a beef dish with cantonese sauce and what i got was literally pieces of beef in ketchup.also ordered a rice and chicken dish, the rice was ok but the chicken was the blandest thing i have ever tasted, just straight up water boiled peices of chicken, no seasoning no flavour, nothing.",1,Imperial China
"good variety, bit too heavy handed with the msg",3,Imperial China
the best for dim sum in china town. a little pricey but worth it.,4,Imperial China
"great food,service and atmosphere.",5,Imperial China
"went in and it looked really nice from the outside. great selection of dishes on the main menu and there is a separate dim sum menu which was incredible. slightly pricey, but the quality of the food balances it out. good selection of wines available too. would revisit again for sure.",4,Imperial China
"great for dim sum, friendly staff",4,Imperial China
"authentic, good atmosphere, nice surroundings and excellent food, service was friendly although staff were slow to engage and take orders.",4,Imperial China
"food was ok, as well as the service. nothing special. the majorly negative thing was that nobody has warned us in advance that they dont accept contactless payment, so we couldnt pay with apple pay. this is not acceptable in the modern world, where you can pay with apple pay wherever you want.",2,Imperial China
been here a few time and the is consistently good! nice chilled atmosphere and we had a nice bottle of sake!  staff were great also!,4,Imperial China

"popular restaurant ideal for groups.serving the usual favourites, perfect for feasts!",4,Imperial China
"my favourite chinese in chinatown for the quality of food. the portion sizes are smaller than usual and prices higher than usual, but both are acceptable for the quality of food. the service is ok for chinatown but would be considered poor for the price in any other cuisine.",4,Imperial China
chaotic service. mediocre food. stuff turns up in person and on your bill you didnt order. ok wine list,2,Imperial China
"that was the softest most delicious roasted duck i've ever tasted, i take off my hat for this extravagantly delightfull meal! ",5,Imperial China
great here. wide range of chinese food. very nice cosy entrance with bridge over fish filled pond. cost atmosphere inside,4,Imperial China
"a good place in chinatown for reasonably priced good food. i have had dim sum as well as dinner here numerous times and it has never disappointed. the small bridge and fish pond at the entrance also lifts the overall feel of the place, setting it apart from some of the other dingy and sticky chinese restaurants around.",4,Imperial China
the food is really good. not cheap but worth the money you pay. service needs polishing but all in all a good restaurant. ,4,Imperial China
"the best chinese food that i have tasted in london's chinatown. the food is not only good, the environment is comfortable and the service is excellent.  highly recommended.  listed in michelin guide 2017",5,Imperial China
"solid chinese, slightly away from the crowds of china town this is always a reliable find, not least as it has 3 floors wait time is low. sign of a good spot is normally majority of people in their are chinese, and service is efficient if a little unfriendly. also v good value.",4,Imperial China

food superb,5,Imperial China

the food was pretty average but the service was great and staff was very friendly,4,Imperial China
"decent place for dim sum. is deceivingly small from the outside, but once you enter there're three floors of restaurant space which means even very large groups can be catered for. slightly upscale and quite fashionable decor compared to some of the other chinatown restaurants.",4,Imperial China
always been there with at least three people or groups. old style food and generally tasty. just a slightly salty and greasy. others are ok.,3,Imperial China

"dim sum has lost its tradition here. you just cannot have fusion dim sum - it does not work. also you need to sort out the waitering service...which was lousy. and buy your chinese tea leaves from a new supplier, the po-er tea was substandard. not on my recommended list of good eats in soho this year.",2,Imperial China
one of the best places for dim sum. its busy but that just means its good,5,Imperial China

"great place, nice interior, lovely food and kind staff!",5,Imperial China
pretty good chinese food. very pricey for what it is though.,3,Imperial China
one of the few chinese restaurants in chinatown which isn't a open-and-scam scheme. it's as good as four seasons. that alone is a 4* rating.the extra * is from not immediately assuming i'm chinese,5,Imperial China

"great food, authentic location",5,Imperial China
"there are lots of chinese restaurants in this area, but i chose this one because a friend recommended it. the service was pretty average, the steamed prawn dumplings were good, but the wanton soup was less than great. im sure there are much better chinese places on this strip. give this one a miss...",3,Imperial China
amazing food and amazing service,4,Imperial China

some of the best dim sum in town. nicely hidden from the street so is a great place if you find it,4,Imperial China
we have been to the restaurant many times and generally the food is ok and i would gice it a three star. but the last visit was very disappointing. food came very late and was very chewy. they told us kitchen is busy because of a wedding - ideally should have told us before we sat down !,2,Imperial China
came for dinner. location is central in china town and convenient for leicester square. the food was only average and chicken kung po was quite tough. crispy duck pancakes were okay. service was lack lustre at best.,3,Imperial China

a reliable west end chinese restaurant. food good. i like the water feature at the entrance.,4,Imperial China
been to most dim sum places around china town and this is the best.  you may pay a bit more but you get that back in quality of food and a nice restaurant setting. clean toilets and staff are reasonably friendly and efficient. ,4,Imperial China

"excellent atmosphere, great food and the service was good too.",4,Imperial China
lovely place for food and karaoke. vegan options available!,5,Imperial China
"great place to enjoy good, authentic dim sum at lunchtime. the service is fast and the food is very reasonably priced. however i find their evening menu to be somewhat run of the mill and nowhere near as good as dim sum. ",3,Imperial China
"incredibly rude staff- forced to order as soon as we sat, were pressured to finish quickly. whole experience was really stressful- like a boot camp meets a restaurant. treated like a fast food in and out, but they are happy to charge higher restaurant prices. food was also average so there's plenty of better choices in the area.",1,Imperial China
unfortunately both dishes were very bland and not like chinese food at all.,1,Imperial China
"was there for a birthday party. poor service and food quality for 37 per person. the food was the quality if a cheap hamburger st fast-food restaurant. the only exception was the private dining room, which was a nice size for 60 people and tables covered in acceptable linens.",2,Imperial China
"bad food, bad service, use to be good but alas no more",1,Imperial China

"very good food (especially the dumplings) at reasonable prices. i was surprised how big it was inside. the entrance is definitely a lot nicer and raised my expectations for the interior. however, it's very basic inside. it's clean and i don't have anything negative to say about it but don't expect a fancy interior.",4,Imperial China
various dim sum dishes for lunch. recommend crispy prawn dimsum. also hong kong style duck is very tasty.,4,Imperial China
"the service was average, more hurried. the food quantity was good and the pricing was just about ok, unless you went for their set menu... in which case it was good! the only reason i am rating them 3 instead of 4 is because of their drinks menu... priced way over ",3,Imperial China
excellent food,5,Imperial China
"the 5 stars are purely for the dim sum, best in london in my experience. love the atmosphere, staff could be friendlier.",5,Imperial China

whenever i crave dumplings i always quickly stop by here. they always taste amazing. the only thing i don't like is that you can only pay by cash.,4,Jen Cafe
"really tasty dumplings, i recommend bejing dumplings, fried squid is also really good. the food is usually served really fast and the prices are affordable.",5,Jen Cafe
"this is a perfect spot in chinatown for wonton soup and dumplings (fried, steamed, vegetarian, duck). i normally don't go for the other options because i just love the soup. they do a nice pearl tea if that's your thing.",5,Jen Cafe
"sadly food is really cheap, but prices high. dumplings are very poor, vegitarian ones tasteless. noodles bland.really pooravoid",1,Jen Cafe
"enjoyed visit here, though crowded inside as weather very cold that day. excellent home made soup, bread and cake, simple food, all at reasonable london prices with view of the serpentine. took some time to get a table, the only downside. in the summer time i . don't think this would be a problem.",4,Jen Cafe

dumpling very nice and made infront of us,3,Jen Cafe

"after the hype of the dumplings i expected them to be really good, but the skin was too thick and stoggy. we ordered eat in and they claimed we said take away and tried to kick us out of the restaurant for eating it in. also they have upped their prices from 5 pound for 8 to 6pound for 7.disappointed for handmade dumplings...",2,Jen Cafe
"reminds me of hong kong, best dumplings in town. noodles are instant but who cares, it tastes good man.",5,Jen Cafe
absolutely rubbish dumplings for the price you pay. rude staff - said that i asked for take out when i clearly didnt. definitely do not recommend.,1,Jen Cafe

"ive walked past this little eatery so often and always wanted to step in for a taste, but today i did and the dumplings are gorgeous, the pakchoi is savoury, the satay beef meatballs with noodles are delicious, and the shredded pork with pickled veg soup is yum yum!",5,Jen Cafe
very nice reasonable chinese food,5,Jen Cafe
nice,4,Jen Cafe
ginger tea very good..belly pork delicious.. otherwise a bit mediocre,3,Jen Cafe
the dumplings were very tasty and authentic. my friend's hot and spicy pork noodles weren't actually spicy unfortunately. the iced milk tea was good as well. pricing is 5 for 7 dumplings (not too bad for london). ,4,Jen Cafe
just walked past i'm afraid,3,Jen Cafe
best dumplings,5,Jen Cafe
food good but not stunning,3,Jen Cafe
"i love this place. amazingly tasty dumplings. it's cheap and cheerful, so don't expect doting waitstaff. but find a table, order a bowl of dumplings, eat, and feel happy... and then get out to make way for the next customers!",5,Jen Cafe
staff are friendly but don't expect a smiley face to great you.the foos however is next level.you don't expect the flavors to burst in your mouth when you sit in the cafe but he foods amazing.the place does need to have a refurb as its a bit tatty,4,Jen Cafe
my go to place for dumplings - order one fried and one steamed. they are so good.,5,Jen Cafe
"cool, traditional, not expansive, good fresh food, downtown london",4,Jen Cafe
"freshly made dumplings. no fuss authentic chinese food. love their dumplings and fish ball soup. must try.  bring cash though, they don't take card payments",5,Jen Cafe
"good dumplings (from what i've heard, don't order anything else). but then they ask if you want some greens (not on the menu). i said yes and then the bill came that a side of broccoli was 7. i challenged the waitress who said that was the price, but can't help feeling this must be a way to gouge the unsuspecting.",2,Jen Cafe
"worst chinese food i've ever had... we had quite a few dishes including the dumplings, the rice dish with bbq pork and duck. all the dishes we had were so bad... very poor quality.. however, service is fast but not worth it to go there... will never go back..",1,Jen Cafe
"appalling customer service. walked in and didn't even bother to greet or sit us down. food was horrible too we ordered jajeangmein and a rice with pork belly and roast duck, it was incredibly salty and hardly any meat",1,Jen Cafe
tasty handmade dumplings  does what it says on the tin !,4,Jen Cafe
"had their dumplings both fried and steamed. the dumplings are well made and delicious. however, the portions leave something to be desired and i definitely left hungry. perhaps not the worst for the price range but i'd recommend ordering 2 or even 3 portions if you actually want to get full.",3,Jen Cafe
"it was not my first time here but now never again! poor food, 50 cents noodles sold for 10 pounds, half a liter of water 3 pounds !! thieves26/12/18",1,Jen Cafe

great place for eats.,5,Jen Cafe

good food,5,Jen Cafe
during my meal a beautiful well-groomed woman came in and the staff refused to serve her based on the color of her skin. deeply disturbing.,1,Jen Cafe
"not allot of chooses, cash only is an inconvenience.",3,Jen Cafe
"i finally had a taste of home in that restaurant. it's all affordable, delicious, and they'll find you a seat anywhere. don't forget to bring cash, or they'll turn you away.",5,Jen Cafe
good cheap chinese food,3,Jen Cafe
"great food, interesting menu system and friendly staff. should be able to pay by card though.",4,Jen Cafe
"nice food but my hubby had a very bad tummy after his, was ill for 2 days, not sure if there was a spice etc that didn't agree with him?",4,Jen Cafe
"i ordered a takeaway but i was told to wait outside for nearly half an hour in the cold (winter time). although i understand they are very busy at sorting out the orders, the dumplings i got at the end was undercooked. wish it would turn out better next time as i saw they make great dumplings.",1,Jen Cafe
ribs here are a joke. small portion and filled with bone. tea tastes like water.,1,Jen Cafe
"i liked the vegetarian dumplings, but my family wasn't impressed by their food. over priced and not obvious that it's cash only.",2,Jen Cafe
just have a quick noodle is good. taste are fine.,3,Jen Cafe
our food felt like it was microwaved. pretty sure this place doesn't have a stove. don't get fooled by the dumpling making in the window,2,Jen Cafe
hand made dumplings were decent. everything else was below average. but fast service you may need to share tables with others though.,3,Jen Cafe
angry staff food was of poor quality overall bad experience here will not be comming back,1,Jen Cafe
"staff are not friendly, and food is a bit pricey",1,Jen Cafe
"not impressed with the beijing dumplings, the wrappers were thick and stodgy and the filling was bland. ",2,Jen Cafe
fresh dumplings made in front of you. great bubble tea much better quality compared to over sweetened colourful drinks you find at bubble tea bars in the area. ,4,Jen Cafe
"cram yourself in there and enjoy the dumpling prepared just now on the table next to you. you can have bubble tea if you really must but it is far from the best around so dumplings, dumplings and more dumplings, preferably fried. they are quite basic but definitely fresh.well worth the wait for a table corner.",4,Jen Cafe
absolutely lovely,5,Jen Cafe
need up dating,4,Jen Cafe
"i met my wife here 12 years ago! :) if you only have a few pounds in your pocket, the desire to have a nice, simple chinese meal, and no desire whatsoever to meet someone for any sort of romantic relationship, but then get married and have a couple kids with them... this is the place to go.",5,Jen Cafe
"great food, the dumplings are highly recommended. be prepared to share a table this isn't a high cuisine restaurant, just great dumplings at a good price.",4,Jen Cafe
amazing dumplings!!! a must if youre in the area,5,Jen Cafe

"service is horrible and rude, they don't even understand english. the worst food in china town. it's totally disgusting. be careful. ",1,Jen Cafe
"one of the most delicious and familiar restaurants in london, i love",5,Jen Cafe
after coming here a few times i came to the conclusion that the dumplings and soup are the only thing i like here. meat is more bone and skin. fried dumplings are good.and really like the won ton soup.,4,Jen Cafe
"amaizing dumplings thats true and yeah they microwave the food,yeah the service can be rude too but is something about the place and the food i dont know, when i go there i know what to spec and i always have a good time",3,Jen Cafe
"so i followed the advice given in the other reviews and just tried the steamed beijing dumplings. i am no expert in the field, but i liked them. i went in the evening during a week day and i did not find any queue, which was fine. it makes a good option if you need a quick and cheap bite when in soho.",3,Jen Cafe
it's ok,3,Jen Cafe

"wonderful food, amazing duck and great dumplings!",5,Jen Cafe
"9 fr 6 small dumplings is terrible value for money. charge far less or give better sized portions; your dumplings are good, but that price bracket is despicable.",3,Jen Cafe
the best dumplings i ever ate. so what if it's not got a fancy layout. go for the food ,5,Jen Cafe
love this place - hustle bustle and so authentic. no frills. delicious.,4,Jen Cafe
"great dumplings prepared everyday right in front of their customers, fast service, and a great location (imho) makes this one of my favourite places to grab a quick lunch. it's not fancy and service is not top notch, but that actually adds to its charm as far as i'm concerned.",5,Jen Cafe
i've only had the dumplings but they were very good and fresh. the place is certainly nothing special decor/service-wise but it's a great place to pop in for a few plates of dumplings and get out quickly.,4,Jen Cafe
these hand made dumplings never disappoint! be ready to share your table with strangers. ,5,Jen Cafe
poor cantonese restaurant selling bad quality foods. ordered char siu rice and wonton soup but it is either good at toast or authentic in cantonese style. just a restaurant in a good location that attracts innocent tourists. ,1,Jen Cafe
"i never leave reviews - but thought i would this time to save a life. i actually wish i could give no stars instead of one. the food and bubble tea is absolutely disgusting,  and the wait staff is horribly rude. will never return to this place again.",1,Jen Cafe
i love this place ! so cheap! and it feels authentic. the staff are super nice. just be clear with what you want as there is a language barrier. ,5,Jen Cafe
"great little cafe, with comfort chinese food at low prices. recommend the handmade section (noodles and dumplings)",4,Jen Cafe
dumplings specialist. it is a fast food ambience you would find in china. so don't expect service with a smile. that said the quality of the food is much higher than any other fast food.,4,Jen Cafe
did not go to this place.keeps piping up for feed back!,1,Jen Cafe
rubbish food and service. i'm literally paying 5 for frozen squid rings and lemon water (which they call lemon tea).,1,Jen Cafe

food somewhat good. portions are small. the place is small but cosy. pearl tea/coffee - no no.,3,Jen Cafe
"great food, but eat pay and leave.",4,Jen Cafe
one of the worst chinese joints i've ever been to. dumplings overloaded with white pepper and spice to hide poor meat quality. bbq meat is also poor quality and drowning in sauce; meat does not appear to be fresh.,1,Jen Cafe
"had dumblings there, it was the worse dumblings that i have ever eaten. thicker skin with untasted fillings. i would not recommend.",1,Jen Cafe

"one of the best chinese restaurants/cafes in london,  cheap, fresh with noodles and dumplings done fresh all day long. service is not the best and is not the most spacious place,but the quality of food is amazing. and the possibility of eating a delicious healthy meal for less than a tenner is impressive. ",5,Jen Cafe
fun,5,Jen Cafe
"very rude staff and you're not made to feel welcome at all. in the end we only ordered drinks and not food, and my drink was lukewarm. would never go there again. ",1,Jen Cafe
their duck noodle soup was ok. but very good dumplings. definitely will come back for that.,4,Jen Cafe
i found their dumplings to be very tasty actually!,3,Jen Cafe

i wasn't expecting to be served instant noodles.... instant noodles. for 7pounds.,1,Jen Cafe
they should use chinese rice instead of long grain,1,Jen Cafe

"i honestly don't know how everyone raves about the dumplings here... it doesn't even taste great, but gloopy, laced with vinegar ir chill oil to mask the 'taste', service is so rude as well!!the only good thing about this store is watching someone make dumplings at the window. this you can do from outside.",1,Jen Cafe

best boba matcha in london.,5,Kova Patisserie Chinatown
tiny shop with no seats. take away only. matcha crepe so nice and creamy. the matcha boba is very milky and not enough matcha flavour. 5.45 pricey for a medium size bubble tea as next door theres two other bubble tea shops that are better and cheaper.,3,Kova Patisserie Chinatown
always liked the macha mille crepe when kova used to just have one location at soho. also like the sea salt lava cake. the new cheezo tea caught up quickly. will be better if it has some sitting but i guess its hard to come by in such an popular area,4,Kova Patisserie Chinatown
order a black sugar bubble tea this afternoon. feels like drinking water with boba. and the one i have receive don't actually look like others who have comment below. p.s i didn't mix it . throw the whole drink straight away after i have a sip,1,Kova Patisserie Chinatown

"this is alright dessert cafe. i have ordered cheese , match, chocolate and crepe cake. cheese cake is good and rest of them is alright. not bad but not so special. i think it is little over priced. i like the individual package was really good.and i can be the plate for the cake.  nice.",3,Kova Patisserie Chinatown
amazing bubble tea and cheezo tea! also in a great location!,5,Kova Patisserie Chinatown

a nice place... and good food.,5,LEON
"fantastic spot. cheapest breakfast around, but also the best we could find, and in a really nice venue. very friendly staff.",5,LEON
"crowded and rather mediocrely maintained, but that's expected in such location. nothing special, as for every chain restaurant. food is cheap and tastes ok, only difference is that it's rather healthy in comparison to other kinds of 'fast food'.",3,LEON
"i'd seen leon in king's x, but never really bothered with it, and i actually thought it was a mini mart for some reason. as it happens they do some healthy, different snacks here. as well as decaf drinks",5,LEON
they only provide single-use disposable cutlery and cups and there are no recycling facilities. this is totally irresponsible and selfish. its time for leon to wake up to the plastic waste crisis.,1,LEON
leon is ok but i do think its overpriced for the portion sizes.,2,LEON
"tasty, healthy, and quick food. really nice staff. chill atmosphere. would definitely recommend",5,LEON

good esspresso,5,LEON
love this place! i am quite  a frequent leon customer as the food is fast and really tasty and doesnt seem unhealthy,5,LEON
"the meal i had was gorgeous! aioli chicken for anyone wondering, the slaw on the side was really fresh and beautifully made, staff were helpful when i had no idea what somethings where and the sheer amount of vegan and gluten free food available was some of the best selection i've ever seen! highly highly recommend",5,LEON
"food delicious, staff very friendly, place very clean, love it :-)",5,LEON
leon is best restaurant to serve porridge across london,5,LEON
"it's a chain, so no unique experience or cozy setting but the food is better than what you get at most chains. pricing is similar to pret, eat etc but the food here taste much better. also has many gluten-free options (including chicken nuggets!)",5,LEON
"would be 5 stars for the great quality of food and service.however, they insist on having the doors wide open (even in the winter) which makes it very cold to eat in. @leon - you could save money and keep customers happier.",3,LEON
love it! healthy food that tastes great!! highly recommend if you're in london and looking for fresh and healthy food!,5,LEON
food wasn't really hot as they advertise....,2,LEON
bom preo e almoo de verdade,5,LEON
tried these wings and a live burger. either over cooked or had been sitting for a while as they had a rubbery taste to them. poor.,2,LEON
"friendliest staff.  good food. great for food allergies/sensitivities.  accidentally drop my closed drink and it started spraying the floor.  staff so nice, cleaning up immediately and even brought me a new drink which i wasnt expecting.  loved leon before but this made my view on the fast food restaurant that much better.",5,LEON
nice healthy fast food,5,LEON
"a leon restaurant with naturally fast food. the staff at this restaurant was very friendly taking my order and quickly prepared it. the burger tasted good and was hot,  the same with the  fries. the restaurant has places to sit down on two levels, but  no places  outside m. the restaurant as a whole looked very clean",5,LEON
"nice food, reasonable price",4,LEON
"first time ever tried one of these, very pleased with food quality, had chorizo chicken and rice, was lovely, staff very polite, plenty of room inside, clean and tidy tables, good value food, would recommend as an alternative to fast food, just slightly more expensive, but good quality.",4,LEON
"very good, affordable food with many veggie options. very quick service, as soon as you ordered something, it was already on the tray.",4,LEON
chicken burger was ok a little lacking in chicken,3,LEON
i love leon food. the shop is always clean and the food is fresh.,4,LEON
pretty good quality compared to price,5,LEON
poor customer service. not feeling to come back to this leon. 15:00 11/10/19,1,LEON
watch when you go to toilet. even with door locked someone didn't take the hint that it was occupied and managed to open the door. thankfully i was no longer on the loo!,3,LEON
the place is very clean. the food is delicious. but the toilets dont close.i recomand this place,4,LEON
love this place. currently my favourite place to eat :),5,LEON
"no gluten free burger any more. apparently its meant to come back this year, but for now theres one less thing to eat if you need gluten free food. there are salad options though.",3,LEON
like the quiet downstairs and healthy food,4,LEON
leon food is always disappointing. portions not great and flavours are all just a bit 'meh'. there are so many better (and cheaper) places to eat in london!,2,LEON

great food. good service.,5,Le Hanoi
great little vietnamese in china town!,4,Le Hanoi
"so so delicious pho. the vegetable pho is so good, but the beef pho is amazing! it is a restaurant with a cooking full of flavours. the price you pay is very reasonable for what you get, so it become a very good option for anyone who wants to eat in london. it worths the visit to chinatown for that pho.",5,Le Hanoi

"its a vietnamese restaurant.. tried the bbq pork and it was really delicious... the soup underneath will be slightly sweet, but was really nice...",4,Le Hanoi
omg 1. service terrible!!! ordered earlier but served later than others.2. insane price they charge most expensive special charge during christmas. 6 pounds for a bottle of water.3. taste changednoodle was already cut it means noodle was too old. and they just want to serve to many ppl not quality food at all.,1,Le Hanoi
"good food, good service, and a good price for the portions.not too crowded either.can't fault it.",5,Le Hanoi
not bad but probably could be a little better. the tofu dishes were good but probably not rush back again.,4,Le Hanoi
"love this place. from the chopsticks to the loos. it's only been open for 2 weeks so i hope they keep the attention to detail on the venue and service. the food was superb. the beef stick starter was the best steak i've tasted in a long time.    this is one to watch.  as word spreads, getting a table might not be as easy.

amazing food - brought back happy memories  from my time in vietnam. morning glory is always a must,4,Le Hanoi
"delicious!portions on the small size, but very flavorful dishes.  we had pho, green papaya salad and spring roll.  the spring roll with taro crust was a wonderful surprise.  the papaya salad was very flavorful.  and i drank every last drop the broth in the pho.  a bit pricey, but would come again. ",4,Le Hanoi
"horrendous service and extremely rude staff. they have no vegan options, and if even if you are exceptionally nice they will serve you nothing but a $10 side dish with a few pieces of tofu and onions. felt extremely disrespected. do not go to this restaurant.",1,Le Hanoi

"bad customer service, missing order, waiting for foods around 20mins.",1,Le Hanoi
had a very lovely time and will be going back soon.by far one of the best restaurants in china town,5,Le Hanoi
"decent enough vietnamese spot, if not a little uninspired, which serves the usual fare, e.g. pho, noodle bowls etc. had a lunch menu which at 9.50 for two courses represented good value for money. i've had better elsewhere in the city but it's certainly worth a visit if you're in the area. service was friendly and attentive.",4,Le Hanoi

good food bit very bad attention,1,Le Hanoi
"this is the first review i am writing in my life and i am sorry to do so. but i have no clue why this place is rated as well. the staff is nice, but the pho was disappointing. no good broth, very bad quality of vegetables, terrible seafood. hopefully i was just unlucky. ",1,Le Hanoi
really nice dishes~it tasted light and suitable for summer~nice service~,5,Le Hanoi
"not bad at all. pho was quite delicious, manager was friendly.",4,Le Hanoi
"the first time i went there it was amazing, second the the pho was not as good as before, broth was very plain.",4,Le Hanoi
great little viet restaurant. my daughter chose is as she was just back from hanoi  ...  she liked it and i did too. might also have the cleanest restaurant loo in london! a good choice!,4,Le Hanoi

"extremely rude stuff the asian guy with the pony tail was extremely rude. his attitude is so bad,  i can feel he doesn't want to serve us . if he really hate his job just quit ! do not show his attitude to the customer! shame on you!!! unexpectable!!!",1,Le Hanoi
"sorry, but in one word...rubbish.  my spring rolls were made with extra thick dough to reduce the filling needed, coming heavy with grease and lacking flavor.  my seafood pho broth was fine, but hardly had any seafood and the noodles were mush to the point i couldnt pick them up with chopsticks.",1,Le Hanoi
tasty food.. fix the door( unpleasantly cold inside ),4,Le Hanoi
"tried pho, dumplings, stir fried noodles, some beef starter - loved them all",5,Le Hanoi

"food is good here , i will recommend",4,Le Hanoi
"the waiter was extremely rude and unpleasant. he looks unhappy while doing his job. they threw the bills on the table, even we didnt ask for the bills yet. wouldnt recommend here.",2,Le Hanoi
not bad but not a real vietnamese place. chinese run business,3,Le Hanoi
really delicious spicy beef bun noodle soup have to try other dishes soon,4,Le Hanoi
good food at good prices considering its location in such a central part of london. the noodles in the pho were quite soggy though but other than that it was yummy!,5,Le Hanoi
"poor example of vietnamese food. appears to be a 'chinese interpretation' of real vietnamese food. gi cun: mostly lettuce. bnh xo: pancake was like tissue paper, mostly onion. salt and pepper squid: mostly very raw onion. mango/papaya salad (gi): dressing too strong, imitation peanut topping.",2,Le Hanoi
touristy location. i enjoyed the starters but the mains lacked authenticity. service was good and decor was modern. give it a try though,3,Le Hanoi
"their lunch time offer is nice, 10 for starter and main, efficient for a quick lunch date. everything else is reasonably priced too! the food is good, above average but dont expect to be blown away. wouldve given it 3 stars based just on food but the staffs attentiveness and speed made me want to give 4.",4,Le Hanoi
in general the food was excellent. my main course though was very spicy (without having a pepper sign on the menu). there was also a service fee of 4.15 for 3 people; why??!!,2,Le Hanoi
rude staff. super hot in there and no air con. and times open advertised not correct.,1,Le Hanoi
big guy with glasses is a bit rude. pho noodles  texture isnt the best. fast service but i wouldnt come back.,3,Le Hanoi
"i ordered a soup, i could have eaten for 2 days! it was delicious!",4,Le Hanoi
"good food, nice taste. bud time between starter and main course was an hour thuis is too long. our neighbours where later in and much quicker done with eating a starter and main course.",5,Le Hanoi
grilled bbq pork with vermicelli is amazing! i had this dish for the first time here but it won't be the last time. the staff very friendly,5,Le Hanoi
"it's ok... i've been to better vietnamese restaurants though! my partner ordered the beef brisket pho and enjoyed it. i, on the other hand, ordered the chilli pork chop with boiled rice and in all honesty, it wasn't very nice... the restaurant's environment was decent and the staff were nice enough though.",3,Le Hanoi
"very authentic vietnamese cuisine! i totally recommend the ban cuon (steamed pork rice rolls), the xeo pancake and my all time favourite sate pho. the seating on the right it is a bit cold so i recommend to wait for a table inside but otherwise it is worth the wait!",5,Le Hanoi
"reasonably priced, friendly vietnamese spot. tasty food, but not exceptional. i had the cold noodles with tofu and it was a great dish for a warm day in london. recommended if you need a quick and easy bite.",4,Le Hanoi
very good overall. beef noodle soup was spice good.  children noodle soup was not spicy and good.  good service.,5,Le Hanoi
well done. banh cuon is very tasty and the rare beef salad is pretty good. the hot mint made it special and good flavour.,5,Le Hanoi
nice place with a large choice.,4,Le Hanoi
a very delicious lunch special of crispy spring roll and lemon grass chicken.,5,Le Hanoi
a great place for a reasonable priced meal in london's chinatown. a decent selection of unusual dishes.,4,Le Hanoi
great taste and good service dont forget to ask a 10% off card for next time,4,Le Hanoi
pretty bland tasting pho. you are better going just around the corner to the pho & bun if you want great tasting pho.,3,Le Hanoi
"food is lovely. if you like pork, try the bun thit nuong dish!",4,Le Hanoi
"its a very good restaurant. the bun bo hue, the pho and the banh cuon are all perfect. the bun bo hue has vietnamese taste, which is spicy, with high-quality beef. the banh cuon is very delicious. the price is not expensive regarding the quality of the dishes. i highly recommend this restaurant.",5,Le Hanoi
"very poor service. waiters argued loudly amongst themselves and one waiter slammed door&threw trays on counter. my 12 years old daughter was alarmed by his antics that i had to tell one of the other waiters for him to stop. they had the nerve to charge us service on top.food was ok, and some dishes were served tepid cold.",1,Le Hanoi
"i ordered chicken pho, taste not bad but the texture of noddles extremely soft. the veggie taste good though. my frd order satey , peanut too strong not much satey taste",3,Le Hanoi
im vietnamese and i did enjoyed food here. the pho broth was so delicious. i also recommend papaya and beef jerky salad. remember to bring cash as you are not allowed to pay by card if your meal costs less than 10/person.,4,Le Hanoi
authentic pho,5,Le Hanoi
lovely food but cramped and sonewhat stuffy if you're seated downstairs.,3,Le Hanoi
super good pho !!! one of my favorite restaurant,5,Le Hanoi
very good quality vietnamese conveniently located around the china town area. the rare beef pho was really tasty - both broth and the beef. don't forget to try the banh cuon as a starter you can't find it to all vietnamese restaurants and when you do its cooking is not as original!,4,Le Hanoi
the broth could have been better but overall delicious. it is very cramped so it was hard to walk in there and the service was very attentive. however it felt like they were rushing us as the server kept peering at us every minute so it was quite uncomfortable.,3,Le Hanoi
"the worst pho bo i ever had. the noodles were not like the typical ones, the meat had a lot of fat, and the mint was almost expired. the summer rolls were mediocre. would not return again",2,Le Hanoi
"great food and helpful, friendly and knowledgeable staff. will definitely visit again.",4,Le Hanoi
the best pho i ate in london. it's hard to find food so good there,5,Le Hanoi
excellent pho and super friendly service,5,Le Hanoi
bun cha had too much raw onion and not enough sauce. tofu bao was just bad,2,Le Hanoi
"the new staple vietnamese restaurant in soho / chinatown. a great selection of dishes and pleasant service. the aubergine starter, fish sauce chicken wings, garlic pho are some of the tastiest dishes i have had in london. plus the it is very affordable!!!",5,Le Hanoi
"the food was above average but the service can be improved - very important in a competitive eating environment that is chinatown. beef pho had a robust soup stock, spring rolls were so-so. busy at  lunchtime",4,Le Hanoi
i had the pork bun cuon after hearing it's made especially by a trained bun cuon chef from vietnam. it's a steam rice wrap with pork in. a new tasting experience!!,5,Le Hanoi
"10+ it's absolutely delicious! i am usually very picky when it comes to food as a good italian, and this place has just surprised me and satisfied me in full dish after dish!not even expensive! and staff is kind and friendly.will come back here to try the rest of the menu asap!",5,Le Hanoi
delicious food nice service and good price!!we will go back for sure .,4,Le Hanoi
"tasty food, quick service, not too cramped in for china town, central london.... overall rather splendid!! portions are large, too large! left feeling like i was about to explode!! if there is two of you, youll only need one main and one rice or noodles to share...... certainly dont need a main each !!!! overall very good !! thanks",4,Le Hanoi
it was ok. not a place i would visit again though.,3,Le Hanoi
"great food great prices and good service, recommended",5,Le Hanoi
"food is full of smoke ((( , made a bad experience ",1,Le Hanoi
bun cha and fried rice was alright. but pho was little bit blend. broth doesn't taste strong as ordinary pho. anyway price was reasonable in central london.,3,Le Hanoi
got some good duck there.the price is good as well,4,Le Hanoi
a great beef soup and friendy and helpful staff,5,Le Hanoi
"the food was delicious and authentic, the staff was friendly and it was not that crowded like other restaurants in chinatown. if you looking for something good with easy prices and calm atmosphere, go there :)",4,Le Hanoi
awesome pho and a good price! highly recommended,5,Le Hanoi
fantastic food and friendly staff. we were in a rush pre theatre and they advised us on the quickest dishes. i had the chicken curry which was delicious. will be coming back soon.,5,Le Hanoi
"been here a couple of times everytime i'm in london, seems a fairly good place each time so happy to keep returning. they've changed the menu since last time but not much else has changed. food was nice, but took a whole betweem courses. value for money is quite good too and they seem to cater for allergys really well.",4,Le Hanoi
"big portions, the stewed pork belly was extremely succulent also, the grilled aubergine were just as tender.",5,Le Hanoi
little gem in london's chinatown. looks like nothing special at first glance but the food we had was seriously good and so was the vietnamese coffee. cheap and hassle free. nothing fancy but definitely recommend if you want good vietnamese food at good value.,5,Le Hanoi
loved this place when it first opened. went recently and its just not the same.,3,Le Hanoi
"staffs should be trained to understand vietnamese culture, be polite with customers.",2,Le Hanoi
"better to reverse a table.first, otherwise it is difficult to just walk in. fair service bit pho is authentic",4,Le Hanoi
delicious food and large portions. the beef pho was particularly tasty and spicy. service was quick and friendly. to pay with card (not contactless) the minimum consumption is 10,4,Le Hanoi
"in china town, this is probably the most promising place (especially if you're going for viet food)...banh cuon, pho, banh xeo are all delicious! cleaner than most restaurant in the area and reasonable prices too...however, some of the waiting staff are just bloody intrusive",5,Le Hanoi
"delicious food. so much so we've gone twice. cool digs in this restaurant, great vibe and music. tables were cleaned thoroughly to my delight.",5,Le Hanoi
"superb. really authentic food, very reasonably priced. i could live on this.",5,Le Hanoi
outstanding vietnamese food. excellent service,5,Le Hanoi
"i'm a fan of bnh cun so when i see that on a menu it's a great start and it was nice here. unfortunately they'd sold out of bnh xo, so will have to return to try that. their grilled bbq pork bun was lovely and the flavours of the pork bought back some childhood memories. will definitely return to try their pho and other dishes",4,Le Hanoi
"good food, careful staff",4,Le Hanoi

group of my visitors from the us went there on a saturday afternoon.food was fine but staff were absolutely abysmal.bordering on rude and obvious;y in a hurry to get rid of the customers.not a good experience and not to be repeated.,1,Lido

disorganised place. the food is good but my partner had to wait his dish more than 10 minutes after mine was served. poor portion of spring rolls (only 2!!!) and it came in the end! we had ordered all at the same time. poor service for the price.,2,Lido
"i couldn't fault the service or the food, although there was a small que, as a family we were seated reasonably quickly. we ordered from one of the set menus and the food was brought to the table, in good timing so you were never felt rushed, or had to wait long for the next course.",4,Lido

"we tasted the crispy duck and it is really very comparable to the last one we had in beijing. not fancy, reasonnable price for a good and tasty food, very well located in the heart of chinatown, it is worth its reputation.",4,Little Four Seasons
"the duck is really very good here! however, this is the typical chinese fast food joint where terrible service is expected, so don't expect much from them! best for a take out if you don't want to deal with angry waiters.",4,Little Four Seasons
"visited many times and therere mix of good and bad experiences. in rush hours just dont expect great customer service, they are likely to bring you the bill before you asked or even finished your food. the taste is ok if you know what to order.",3,Little Four Seasons

"cantonese restaurant that is perfect for big groups. the roasted duck, sweet and sour pork, fried rice and sour & spicy soup are recommended. most dishes are for sharing. do not expect impeccable service - they are known for their food but not service. this place is popular with locals and tourists.",4,Little Four Seasons

"overrated food. ordered a variety of dishes roast duck, morning glory,   beef and veg, pro ribs. service so so. pork ribs were dreadfully inedible- not fresh. do not serve dim sum.",3,Little Four Seasons
to be honest the food is good but a particular bespectacled male waiter shouted at me for raising my hand to order my food and took my order in an extremely rude manner. was on the brink of walking out.. it spoiled my whole dining experience.,1,Little Four Seasons

"good isnt bad but not worth the price, paid more than 50 for two people. service is good and the place is busy",3,Little Four Seasons
it's ok. food was good but far too expensive for the service and the decor. it is bang in central london which is what you end up paying for.,3,Little Four Seasons

"for chinese food, perhaps one of the best in london.",5,Little Four Seasons
the duck is excellent - but a restaurant of this calibre should train their staff better. i'd like them to explain the dishes properly to my non-chinese diners. politeness is key for repeat business!,4,Little Four Seasons

(propably) the most famous dish roast duck.. the duck is a little lax. average level.,3,Little Four Seasons
standard chinese food though slightly expensive. not very friendly service due to busy regime it has everyday. no advanced booking. first come first serve basis and be prepared to sit in narrow tables. do not recommend coming here in crowds bigger than 4 people.,3,Little Four Seasons
cantonese cuisine. you can have an excellent meal or just a mediocre one. unpredictable. the service is the typical standard in chinatown,3,Little Four Seasons
"good:gives out a free orange as dessertbad: with a compulsory >10% service charge which is not (clearly) shown on the menu outside. quite cunning.non-traditional ingredient. the barbecued sweet pork is cooked from a cheaper kind of meat, as opposed to the traditionally used part of pig, making it dry and hard.",3,Little Four Seasons

"peking duck was succulent. one duck is enough for four people. kailan vegetable dish was also very good. we will definitely be back to try their other roasts. the only downside is that it's crammed and little messy, but that is typical of most chinese restaurants in chinatown.",4,Little Four Seasons
nice food. quick service. roast pork was the highlight.,4,Little Four Seasons

the food is quite good but the service is rude expensive,3,Little Four Seasons

all the service below charge 7.11 pounds,1,Little Four Seasons
great place to have the best roast duck. apart from that nothing else to mention in good terms. service is a joke. chinese get the best treatment,2,Little Four Seasons
crispy duck is good so delicious,5,Little Four Seasons
"the roast duck too fattening! the cut is bad, too huge a piece! worst is their white rice, so cold and it seems like overnight rice... be frank the roasted duck tasted quite good just the cut is bad. other dishes are alright.",2,Little Four Seasons
good choice for cantonese dishes and amazing  (pork tripe chicken stew),4,Little Four Seasons
good food.,4,Little Four Seasons
"came here feeling hungry and excited but left feeling like id been robbed. very expensive! food isnt that great. the satay sauce was awful, thai style chicken had no thai flavour at all and the roasted bbq pork was not tender or as tasty as ive had in other chinese restaurants. overall i was disappointed.",2,Little Four Seasons
"as others mention, you should probably order a whole crispy duck, which is a huge meal for two or a main course for three. it's what they're famous for. hands down best i've tasted in london. service is verrrry brisk, even for chinatown, but not pushy. prices are reasonable. definite recommend.",5,Little Four Seasons
just the same as every four seasons. can get crowded.,3,Little Four Seasons
"their dumplings are sublime. i thoroughly enjoyed all the food i had here, and the tea is lovely too. service was quick, but no staff spoke to us really; they just showed up to take our order, but we didn't mind as it felt more casual that way.",4,Little Four Seasons
"very nice dishes, but waitress are in a hurry...",3,Little Four Seasons
"tried the most famous - pork stomach with chicken hot pot, very good! the only prob is that queue is always very long at peak time.",4,Little Four Seasons

"good food in a very authentic place. the atmosphere is not great, staff is not really nice but the food is very tasty and well prepared. the very vast majority of the customers is asian; to me it is the best proof that the food is authentic and good. i recommend this place",4,Little Four Seasons
delicious food and staff were friendly to us. really good roast meats and sweet and sour dishes,5,Little Four Seasons
tasty food. friendly staff.,5,Little Four Seasons

one of my favourite resturant too. especially their crispy pork. highly recommended,5,Little Four Seasons
"the service was absolutely shocking (from the door staff and the waiter). the menu is not clear and the food is ok, although our dishes arrived 10 minutes apart.",1,Little Four Seasons
how this place is regarded as only 3.6 is scandalous!! this is by far the best chinese restaurant i have ever been to in the whole of europe!!,5,Little Four Seasons
excellent food quality and tastes. very authentic chinese with typical chinatown style of services. no ambience so just come here for good chinese foods. always busy and reservation is taken here.,4,Little Four Seasons
the bbq meats are nice. service is good.  my advice is to book to avoid the queue which is hard to justify the wait outside,4,Little Four Seasons
"excelent food, reasonable price, could improve the service",4,Little Four Seasons
"the food was not bad actually. the duck was a bit dry but chicken and beef dishes were nice. the french beans on the side were really good.however, service is not great in this place. staff is rather rude and pushes you around.it's also rather pricey and i think you're better off with some of the take away options around.",2,Little Four Seasons
2 years i had to wait to come to london and finally got back to this great restaurant.,5,Little Four Seasons
"the deep fried duck was the only option because i came in a party of 2. hot and sour soup and mapo tofu wasnt great. but it was the closet thing we can get from home. overall, decent experience, decent food and great waitress services. slightly pricey.",4,Little Four Seasons
absolutely outrageous service.. no consideration for customers. a little chinese club where queueing doesn't mean anything.. food is good to be fair but not worth giving them your hard earned cash.. loads of other chinese places as good around here. and as my italian companion say: simpatici come un bacco in culo..,1,Little Four Seasons
5 star all for their roast duck. always go there and order it. other dishes are average but the duck is just outstanding and even better than what i had in hong kong.,5,Little Four Seasons

"best roast duck ive had, even compared with asia. those who rate low just arent used to chinese standard of service. in chinese culture its more about the food, not the niceties of service and looks. heavily underrated, should be a 3.9.",5,Little Four Seasons

the hotpot - pork stomach and chicken in black pepper broth is a must have here. make sure you get there early to avoid the queue.,5,Little Four Seasons

a place with normal food. just order the roasted meats and youre good.,2,Little Four Seasons

great hot pot dish. fast and kind service as well.,5,Little Four Seasons
if you want traditional cantonese then this is wonderful. chilli crab and spicy chicken to die for. if you want your local chinese takeaway this may not be for you. if you like good food and honest straightforward service. this is for you.i loved it and will be visiting again!,5,Little Four Seasons

nice korean food at a good price with good variety,4,Little Korea Restaurant
incredibly rude service and bad food. i would never go there again. you can see some of the five star reviews here are just management rebuttals belittling their patrons feedback and telling them to grow up. i expect the same thing to follow my review to keep their rating at a mediocre 3. no way to run a business. ,1,Little Korea Restaurant

horrible service with very impatient staff. the ingredients were not fresh and the hot pot didn't taste good either. won't recommend it if you want something local. ,1,Little Lamb London

not too bad food but staff could be friendlier,3,Little Lamb London
"23 per person all you can eat appeared quite steep, but was more than compensated for by the freshness and variety of ingredients. 10% mandatory service charge, waived upon presentation of student card.",5,Little Lamb London
"decent hotpot, with a range of different meats and vegetables available in an all you can eat format. be sure to get the special sauce.",4,Little Lamb London
"get the special spicy stock, and about 3 dishes per person feels right. my recommendations would be the fuzhou fish balls and the mongolian bean noodles. at 20 it's not bad for the experience.",2,Little Lamb London

better than it was. prices have become more competitive than they were. service .. there is some now.. that's an improvement. stocks a slightly different range of brands than competitors. we find ourselves in fung a lot more frequently than a few years ago. maybe i'm paranoid but .. the hygiene standard of the butchery could be better.,4,Loon Fung Chinatown

unfriendly staff. staff does hardly know any english. the wine we had ordered never came. the roasted duck was salty and more bones than meat. expensive for what they had served. worst chinese restaurant i've ever been at. when we made a remark the guy started arguing... 1 star is too generous,1,Lotus Garden
"worst chinese in china town, poor service, food purely grease and cold. it is over priced rubbish. when i was there 5 tables arrived and left again staff were pure rude. i wont even feed it to my dog. if i had a choice id give it know stars. stay away.",1,Lotus Garden

decent priced dim sum,4,Lotus Garden

"it was the worst experience. the waiter was very unfriendly and unpolite. my pregnant wife asked for a table away from the ac the waiter said, she should put her jacket on!! the atmosphere of the restaurant was from the beginning not very nice. i would definitely recommend to try another restaurant. its a shame of china town london. :/",1,Lotus Garden
"this has to be my favorite chinese restaurant ever, i try to get here for lunch whenever i'm up in town. well frequented by chinese nationals is always a great sign. i ate there yesterday and the duck with ginger and pineapple was as tasty as always. treat yourself and make a beeline for this place.",5,Lotus Garden

great food and good price,4,Lotus Garden
disgusting,1,Lotus Garden
"dim sums are decent but slightly inconsistent, with the siu mai being a particular highlight. service is quite typical for a chinese restaurant, being busy and efficient ratger than welcoming, so don't expect tpp notch services. for a place for dim sum however, this is definitely a place worth considering in chinatown.",4,Lotus Garden

great food huge portions,5,Lotus Garden
"don't order two meals and two starters for two people, there will be enough for 5!!",4,Lotus Garden

"delicious food, unpleasant service.",3,Lotus Garden
"distinctly average. between the two of us 50% of our food was pretty tasty (if a tiny bit cold), but the other 50% was not at all good. avoid the barbecued meat dish unless you like fatty inedible cuts of pork on plain cold rice.",2,Lotus Garden
"decent dim sum, similar standard and prices to nearby places. was disappointed to see shark fin on the menu, highly unethical and wasteful practice. should not be encouraged.",3,Lotus Garden
"with many similar chinese restaurants on the main street, this one just about stands out. authentic food with delicious dim sum. service can vary but is always quick. can be quite crowded sometimes with long queues. i would probably avoid the busy peak times during dinner",4,Lotus Garden

"all you can eat 10.95 chinese food loads of choice , would recomend & return",5,MW Buffet
the food was good but my reason to put only 2 stars is because the dishes are not washed properly and just wiped with wet towel which make me to asking my self ..... who was eated  before me? i am really disappointed what i saw today.,2,MW Buffet
"food ok , cash only and 10% service charge on top of bill. also no draught beer all out of cans, coca cola served out of 2 litre bottle. plenty of other choices in area . shop around i will next time",1,MW Buffet
"decent enough selection. most of the choices were rather bland. not bad, just very little flavor. personally, i expect chinese food to have some decent flavor. if you prefer bland, give it a shot.",3,MW Buffet
"the buffer has plenty of options for vegetarians and mest eaters alike. i really liked the chili potatoes, vegetable curry, as well as the broccoli and deep fried options. no fake meats - which is a plus. the vegetable soup tasted really good; however, the sweet and sour option tasted a bit too fake.",4,MW Buffet
all you can eat buffet. quality of food is average but if you are really hungry and can eat 5 plates of food it is worth the price. i paid 12 and ate 4 plates of food.,3,MW Buffet
"the food has to be the worst chinese food i have ever had! i was with a large party so did not want to make a fuss, but it was really really bad. you have been warned, pay a bit extra elsewhere for something that at least will be edible. the best part of the meal was some tinned prunes - gives you some idea.",1,MW Buffet
"it's a chinese buffet in a china town-london.it offers several dishes in a cheap price.but, it's just a cheap price.overall dishes are so oily.",3,MW Buffet

nice food and reasonably priced,5,MW Buffet
if the food had been a little warmer it might have been a lot better. it was cheap for central london but not exciting. i will not be visiting again.,2,MW Buffet
good value,4,MW Buffet
"if i could give this 0 stars i would. the food is flavourless and dry, the egg fried rice is cold and the noodles taste like plastic. for the taste of the food it is so overpriced. i would never come back here again, massively disappointed would not recommend.",1,MW Buffet
"dont not give them any tips....look at the total cost...they add the tips in.....u getting your food  ""walking up & down the stairs"" , and still asking for the service charge..... unbelievable",1,MW Buffet

"foul, dry, tasteless, poor quality, too salty, cold. these are just some words to describe the food without being too insulting. looks great from outside but please avoid like the plague. it's disappointing discusting and must be shut down.",1,MW Buffet
great flavors and lots of choice.,5,MW Buffet
i food the staff very accommodating. the food is good for a buffet. toilets are pretty much trash. i didn't mind the stairs because it helped me digest a little.,3,MW Buffet
not as bad as people say. the staff was really nice. the food wasn't that bad. maybe not as tasty as we could expect it to be and some times the food is a bit cold. try it for yourself! it really isn't that bad!,3,MW Buffet
"there was good variety of food and the staff were very nice and prompt, but it felt very crampt, especially having to go to and from the buffer, we found ourselves bum brushing on people's tables, not nice for them, and there was a minimal selection for the dessert, although the jelly was very interesting and tasty",3,MW Buffet
miss charged. dont look st the price on the window this is incorrect. food was luke warm greasy as sin and left with a lovely film on my tongue. will never return,1,MW Buffet

good food in good price. but the stuff isn't polite. they are seeing you as pounds.,4,MW Buffet
"it's okay. if you're really hungry, you can definitely get value for money here, but the food isn't amazing. the staff can vary between incredibly friendly and incredibly rude for no obvious reason. most of all, i'm not sure why they add a service charge to your bill. it's a buffet. you do 70% of the table service yourself.",3,MW Buffet
for the price the foods ok but the seating crowded and up stairs seeting is extremely hard to get,2,MW Buffet
"good food, appreciated.",4,MW Buffet
disgusting greasy umedible food that is stone  cold... stay away!!!,1,MW Buffet

food is tasty and relatively varied,3,MW Buffet
it's ok. i have had much better. too few meat options. price is quite low but i am not sure i would go again. meat parcels in singapore sauce was good.,3,MW Buffet

not up to mark.did not enjoy at all.,1,MW Buffet
"luke warm food, hardly any left in the containers at 6pmnot worth the money",1,MW Buffet
"as buffets go this ranks right up there wide choice on offer, good wine hit and miss thou as to whether the dishes are hot, warm or cold but when they do get it right the three stars i gave become four  desserts i would give them a miss thus back to three.",5,MW Buffet

mr woo we love you !we had a woo-nderful time,4,MW Buffet
"the food is not very good and the service is one of the worse i have experienced. unfriendly, agressive when you ask for something, they treat you like nothing. not even goodbye when you say so. avoid avoid !!!",1,MW Buffet

food good reasonable price. good selection of drinks. shame no ice cream for desert.,4,MW Buffet
"simple, loads of food and 10.50 excl see charge. fills you up good",5,MW Buffet
terrible food terrible service,1,MW Buffet
10.95 + 1.10 mandatory service charge per head for the all-you-can eat buffet. but you'll find it imposible to stomach much of the flavourless and luke warm strands of meat around bones. there are many other restaraunts around piccadilly circus that are better,1,MW Buffet
"for 11.00 pretty decent. food was good, but a bit greasy. lots of fat.",4,MW Buffet
"this is your basic all you can eat chinese buffet. around 10 each, but they add a 10% service charge. the food is ok, lots of options and free tap water if you ask. ",3,MW Buffet
"great value for london, good selection of food however some standards were missing on our visit fried chicken balls and chicken and cashew nuts to name two.",5,MW Buffet
even if it is most expensive from other buffets in china town and they charge for service but definitelly they serve the best food in that area,5,MW Buffet
"great selection of east asian food, but sometimes you need to wait for food to arrive.  staff is informative and friendly. if you want to get full and like sweet and sour,  this is the place. ",4,MW Buffet

"food ok, it looks they changed the menu recently but still crowded especially in weekends and if some festivities are in the area. i'm glad it didn't rain on sunday when i was, because i've queued for  almost 30 minutes outside the canteen.",3,MW Buffet
great food! the waiting queues could get really long during lunch and dinner.,5,MW Buffet
"chip price! but you get what you pay for. chewy food, rude staff, dirty toilet. service charge in the bill..for what? it's a buffet. shocking food and no manners at all! never back again.",1,MW Buffet
"so bad! water from the tap and i paid for that, cold food, bad rice, not good quality. don't go it's not worth.",1,MW Buffet
really great food. eat as much as you can. take some doggy-bags and fill them up but don't let the staff catch you. they will kill you and cook you and eat you. be careful,5,MW Buffet
the starters and mains were good but i have had better and a wider range in other parts of the country. the roast duck was nice. the desserts however were atrocious oranges were bitter and the jelly desserts were vile. toilets were passable but didnt like the 10% service charge.,3,MW Buffet
"good choice of food,friendly staff..no problems..happy",5,MW Buffet
"walked in expecting a decent buffet, it looked tasty from the outside.  apart from the lemon chicken there was absolutely nothing tasty about it.  everything else was bland, and the sweet and sour sauce was disgusting, nothing sweet about it whatsoever,piss poor dessert selection.",1,MW Buffet
not great .staff are very cold. not expensive,1,MW Buffet
"i personally don't like how they arranged my seat, there were few more 2-seat table on first floor but they brought us to very very corner at downstair that facing the wall, i don't mind if first floor was full then. taste was expected as not delicious so my rating was based on my experience and their hospitality.. ",2,MW Buffet
it's your average chinese buffett reasonably priced and a medium selection of food. i've had a much wider selection elsewhere but it did ok. ,3,MW Buffet
very good food service not great very dark down stairs.,4,MW Buffet
"there are only two words to describe this dive - grim and avoid.situated on the doorstep of some of the finest chinese food in the country, mw buffet (or mr wu's) is a national disgrace. the terrible food is only topped by the 10% service charge - levied in a restaurant where you load your own plate and serve yourself.what a joke.",1,MW Buffet
"very inexpensive, with a massive variety of freshly made buffet food! ",5,MW Buffet
pretty good food. not great though.,3,MW Buffet
so so food. not the best in chinatown but you can fill up. fast rotation on waitingline.,3,MW Buffet

"food was terrible, they charge you 10% extra for nothing.i do not recommend.",1,MW Buffet
"the food is fine for the price, but salty. this is not gormet eating but filling your boots on a budget. good choice on the buffet.",4,MW Buffet

brilliant food,5,MW Buffet
this was the cheapest buffet we could find in the area.  it is busy and popular  food is good and freshly made and continuously replenished and there is a reasonably large choice. there is a large dining area in the basement.  i don't know why these buffets charge 10% service when there is none really.,4,MW Buffet

"my wife love it, tofu is her favorite. i personally really would like to see some sweet and sour chicken there, but when you mix lemon chicken with some sweet and sour sauce it gets closer to that taste... so basically we are coming there to eat only tofu and prawns :) nice people working there, very polite and kind.",5,MW Buffet

",1,MW Buffet
not nice at all,1,MW Buffet
as buffets go  mw buffet is a nice place with a good selection of food. the desert section could do with a bit of variety as it looks unappealing. the staff were a bit rude and we did feel rushed out the door with the bill placed on the table once we had one plate and we were going to order more drinks but decided not to and to go.  ,2,MW Buffet

nice food for the price but it is cash only.,4,Misato
one of the best cheap eats in china town. the katsu chicken/pork is one of the best. the udon in a broth with prawns and veg tempura are also recommended,4,Misato

tasty fried chicken. succulent and large portion with nice seated environment.service is a bit slow but feels definitely overpriced.,4,Monga Fried Chicken 艋舺雞排
the chicken was cooked very well but the seasoning was far too sweet for my tastebuds. the fried chicken at good friend on little newport street is much more fulfilling and tastier. #friedchicken #tfc #taiwanesefriedchicken #chinatown #taiwanesefood,3,Monga Fried Chicken 艋舺雞排

rude staff and very poor food.,1,Mr Wu
best place to eat in chinatown in london. we been visiting from 5 years and never get enough ,5,Mr Wu
wasnt impressed with this place.  you get what you pay for.  price is cheap an thats reflected in the service and food.  when the menu tells you they dont serve tap water for free this sets your expectation levels.  food was average and more veg than meat in the dishes.  far better places to eat in chinatown,2,Mr Wu
love the choice of food,5,Mr Wu
"the employees are so rude, they asked me to go out and i did not even have two hours eating there, i just wanted to get relaxed, so i started comolaining about the service and one of the employees forced me to go out. i do not recommend it at all.",1,Mr Wu

"a small all you can eat buffet. nothing fancy or gourmet, but well made mild average chinese food. price is comparatively low (7.95 gbp pp during the lunch plus 0.5 gbp tea and 1.5 gbp drinks), the place is well maintained, but it can be crowded during the lunch time.",4,Mr Wu
really enjoyable and cheap too!,5,Mr Wu
"one of the cheapest buffets in china town. the restaurant its self its cash only and tables are tiny, you feel a little squashed in. limited selection of food but it tastes good and is replaced fairly regularly. cash only, which seems fairly common in the area",4,Mr Wu
great buffet at very reasonable price,4,Mr Wu
the food was tasty but limited choice,3,Mr Wu
cheap and cheerless. tiny room packed with as many tables as they could fit which means the queue is standing right next to your table the whole time. food quality was average. all of the curry dishes seemed to be a packed with onion....lots and lots of onion....,2,Mr Wu
no room in this place not a good selection would not recommend,1,Mr Wu

"decent selection of food, very good value and always packed so the food doesn't stay out that long. been going there 2 - 3 times a month for almost a year now and will keep going back.",5,Mr Wu
food was very average and the place is super crowded. price is cheap so i guess you get what you pay for.,3,Mr Wu
"staff seemed unwelcoming and unpleasant, forgot our drink order.environment was uncomfortably small and cramped, shoulder to shoulder with strangers, food was limited and low quality, and overall the place looked unappealing to the eye, would not recommend",1,Mr Wu
not a huge selection. but for the price and in london it was great value. reasonable quality food too. restaurant was a bit tight. staff were friendly.,4,Mr Wu
cheap and tasty,5,Mr Wu
"simple, not very spacious, low prices, medium food quality, medium service experience",3,Mr Wu
"salty and fatty foods. i only liked the sweet and sour chicken. the staff were not friendly and welcoming. i'd go here if i'm on a tight budget. however, the manager is cute so that's for two stars not the restaurant haha.",2,Mr Wu
the food made me fart so hard. chocked.,3,Mr Wu
cheap and good. nothing special but i like it and always return because of the price. thanks.,3,Mr Wu
"tasty hot food. had to ask for a spoon/knife (only fork on table).no option of  tap water in this place, very suprised.. 4 stars if water provided.",3,Mr Wu

the place was small and had limited variety of food,3,Mr Wu
very reasonably priced buffet. good selection of dishes.,4,Mr Wu
"i think it is a case of value for money. a 10.50 all you can eat buffet that includes duck, pork, beef, shrimp cooked to an acceptable standard as were the vegetables.the restaurant was clean, organized and the  staff friendly. dessert was a waste of time - gelatined milked, tinned peaches and prunes (are you serious mr wu?)",3,Mr Wu
good value especially for the location but the food was at best average and the choices were also limited. extremely hot to the point of being uncomfortable. i'd pay a bit more and go somewhere else.,3,Mr Wu
"dont be hasty. walk further in and with additional 2 pounds, your tummy will thank you. :)",1,Mr Wu
mr wu can suck on my sweet and sour pork balls. hoping i havent got food poisoning. absolutely awful food.,1,Mr Wu
"can't beat the value and variety of flavours. worth putting up with the cramped conditions and long wait. going after lunch, food is still fresh and queues much lighter.",5,Mr Wu
not good. avoid,1,Mr Wu
"poor choice for vegans, food is not great and staff are rude, just want your money and you out.",2,Mr Wu
"very poor restaurant, felt very uncomfortable and dodgy- no free tap water and cash only (i wonder why). one star only because the food was decent",1,Mr Wu
fast chinese takeout,3,Mr Wu
extremely rude woman at the reception. i asked about seafood and started shouting at me unecessary!,1,Mr Wu
"food was either bland, mediocre or dry, staff always seemed burdened to help you, too many table with the space, barley room to walk single file",1,Mr Wu
"really don't bother. terrible food, rude staff and was asked to pay before we even sat down. very little variety of food choices.",1,Mr Wu
crampt over packed but the foods cheap.,3,Mr Wu

lovely pre theatre dinner. highly recommend. great price,5,Mr Wu
"very cheap, but served very bad food and asked for  water in jug,  but refused",1,Mr Wu
the food is what you pay for. but to my family this place is a staple london eatery.  it's cheap and edible and in china town and generally just part of the london experience for us. ,3,Mr Wu
lovely chiness restaurant. great quality food at reasonable prices. nice service and spacious table layout. ,5,Mr Wu
"had to pay first, food was vile. now i know why you pay first. yukkkkk bland tasteless experience.. ",1,Mr Wu
all you can eat for 10.95 gbp + 10% service fee. ok but if you don't need to make a pig of yourself you can find much tastier places in the same price range.,2,Mr Wu
decent lunch takeaway offer 5,3,Mr Wu
i wouldnt eat this food if i was starving to death.,1,Mr Wu
cheap budget buffet with decent selection of food. staff are not friendly and make you pay when you arrive which is very odd. food was the usual greasy food you'd expect. ,4,Mr Wu
excellent service,5,Mr Wu
"pay before eating, surly staff. not the best food in china town.",2,Mr Wu
excellent food especially on a budget but eat all you can. only downside is can be very busy and seating is limited. queing system in place ,4,Mr Wu
cheapest if not the best all you can eat chinese buffet in chinatown,4,Mr Wu
awful service. good effort but poor attainment. i'd rather go to dstrkt and do a bottle than come here and feel like a pauper. ,1,Mr Wu
"gross!! don't go! horrible experience. the ""food"" was cold, had no taste, place was crowded, and no water. it's an all you can eat buffet but i didn't go back for more... i left as soon as i could.",1,Mr Wu

food nice but not much room ,3,Mr Wu
"if you don't understand cantonese please don't go into this shop, they curse all their customers in cantonese, especially the middle aged ugly lady, she is really racist if you can understand what comes out from her mouth. only 1 pound cheaper but the service is suck, i don't mind pay more going to others.",1,Mr Wu
oh good grief... don't do it... never a good sign when there's vomit in the loo at a restaurant!,1,Mr Wu
fantastic lovely happy family restaurant. eat big for a fraction of the big restaurant's.  see you again on our next visit,5,Mr Wu
"nope nope nope. uncomfortable, small, cramped space with bland food that all tastes the same. even for a quick bite, you should look elsewhere.",1,Mr Wu
"absolutely horrible food, would not recommend at all. they need shutting down for the food they serve, everything was either cold and rock hard or just warm and soggy, everything was soaked in grease.",1,Mr Wu
"busy buffet on weekends, food is replaced often. cheap at 8.95 and soft drinks at 1.50. however, not much choice (more vegetables than meat, cheap greasy cuts, food did not taste great very average). to sum it up, go there if you are starving but do not expect much).",2,Mr Wu
"from the door in, the restaurant looks dirty. the seating is awful. the food is 1 star at best. the drinks were all watered down. the staff was not friendly at all. i would not recommend this place to anyone. chinese food in usa's crappiest safeway is better. ",1,Mr Wu
"simple chinese food. very good value for money. actually the quality of the food and the service is dropping down in time. it was the best cheap food in the neighborhood, now is still the cheapest but the worst food.",2,Mr Wu
terrible service the worst i have ever seen in 30 years was shouted at by a member of staff,1,Mr Wu
firstly if you're going here you might as well go to mrw buffet up the road as it's pretty much the same place but with better food. this place is usually packed as it's cheap. the service is the usual china town style. you feel like you're going through border control instead of eating out. can be fun though.,3,Mr Wu
decent chinese food. not a huge variety. good place to get a legitimate all you can eat chinese in chinatown. very central chinatown location.,3,Mr Wu
the cheapest and best tasting food in chinatown!,5,Mr Wu
"the food was quite dry. the rice was overcooked and there was no extra sauce. the shrimp crisps and spring rolls were good tho. but you only get a fork, no knife or chopsticks and the drink aren't cold.",2,Mr Wu
i asked for extra chicken not eczema chicken. food was clearly more than a day old.  and for some reason they don't 'sell water'. which was good because there were no mens toilet anyway.,1,Mr Wu
"eat at your peril, food hygiene terrible.shame can't give it zero stars.got stomach  cramps and was ill a few hours after eating here.poorly for days after.i should have read the reviews first about it being bad.going to report it to environmental health this week",1,Mr Wu
really cheap all you can eat and tasty authentic food,5,Mr Wu
"if you just want to eat rice and noodles, then it is okay. but everything else was poor. stale food. 10% service charge?! what service???  a person ran into the toilet and threw up in the sink when we were there.... wasn't a pleasant experience.",1,Mr Wu
disgusting buffet! everything was sooooooooo dry and defo not worth 8. it was sooo bad that i only ate half a plate. i recommend to you guys to not come this place.,1,Mr Wu
one of the waitress were rude ! she was kind of mad while talking to her ! after that ! the food was ok.,1,Mr Wu
terible service cold food rude staff avoid this place,1,Mr Wu
waiter services was bad. they served buffet but looking down on people as feel like only poor ppl will eat there.,1,Mr Wu
it is definitely 7.95 quality food,5,Mr Wu
no taste,2,Mr Wu
"awful restaurant, think ive got food poisoning now",1,Mr Wu
very bad experience... rude and unhealthy,1,Mr Wu
"ate there & the atmosphere is so tense with staff & they want payment there & then & they charge for left over food too!?!? they are so rude! food quality low, hygiene low & all tables squished together i will never return or recommended the place!",1,Mr Wu
"food was barely warm, the duck had a big shard of bone in and there's a 10% service charge.",1,Mr Wu
"cheap all you can eat, went there during chinese new year, so it was really busy. the food was nice with a big selection, there are many healthy options. the flow was a little bit strange, but they'll help you if you ask.",4,Mr Wu
place was filthy and the food was plain,1,Mr Wu
rude staff. no tap water available but told this quite abruptly with the tag line 'we don't serve alcohol so we don't have to serve tap water'. nice food. horrible staff and service.,1,Mr Wu
"food was cold, salty. i bought a drink and asked if i could have some tap water and they just shoved a menu in my face saying the government doesn't require them to supply tap water. so, for 8.95 this isn't worth it, all you can eat fine, but the food is so sub par you won't want to.",1,Mr Wu
disgusting food .poor costumer service. very unhygienic. will advice u not to go that shop .i would give it 0 stars ,1,Mr Wu
"rude staff, rip off prices on sundays and poor food, all whilst crammed into a tiny shop with barely any room. please find somewhere else to enjoy your sunday!",2,Mr Wu
can't beat mr wu for a cheap eat there's a pretty good section of dishes on offer and it's eat as much as you like.,5,Mr Wu
food quality is on or above average and the environment is fine. the only issue is that the staffs seems to be hurried and they're always staring at the front door. and it feels like someone is staring at you when you're having your meal.,3,Mr Wu
"extremely crowded and the whole experience was ordinary. it's really cheap especially for central london, but don't visit the place if you want to enjoy a calm dining experience. the food quality is all right, but there were several things that were way too salty.",3,Mr Wu
"mediocre, staff not very friendly",3,Mr Wu
please don't waste your money- horrible foodthe chips were stale it tasted like it was there an entire week. none of the food was fresh or great tasting. there isn't even an option of free tap water. i have yet to find an actual good chinese restaurant in china town.,1,Mr Wu
"7 all you can eat, very decent quality food and a good selection as well. one of the best cheap places in central london to grab a bite",5,Mr Wu
the food was terrible and cold. the food looked like something out of men in black. the staff were rudeness and disrespectful. they don't do tap water???  toilets are grim,1,Mr Wu
"small interior and few selections, but food is decent. ",3,Mr Wu
"food is very average, but to be fair it's a good value for money chinese buffet. you eat your fill, leave and forget you were ever there. it's a mcdonalds style food stop, if mcdonalds did chinese.",3,Mr Wu
very good price for a buffet. it's a tiny place with very few places to sit,4,Mr Wu
we loved the food. it's small and you must pay  before you eat. but we enjoyed it. we will be back this winter.,5,Mr Wu
very friendly restaurant good food and service,5,Mr Wu
"i can see why mr wu has many 1 star ratings.buffet food is greasy,salty and warm.mens toilets is dark smelly and filthy.i dont like giving bad reviews,but what i have written is an honest review.",1,Mr Wu
"if you are looking for cheap and cheerful, at least it's cheap!",3,Mr Wu
really bad food and rude staff and management fried rice smelled rotten we did not eat it. please pay a little more go somewhere else. they also make you pay before you eat because they know how bad the food is.,1,Mr Wu
not to bad.... 8.99 dinner plus drink its ok,5,Mr Wu
the buffet had a good selection of fresh cooked items and all piping hot the selections are a good balance of authentic chinese & western variants,5,Mr Wu
7.80 for all you can eat. good food. probably the cheapest restaurant in soho.,5,Mr Wu
great chinese food buffet at very affordable price - eat all you can!the restaurant does not accept credit cards.  cash basis only. #lvpmoment,5,Mr Wu
the food here is soooooo bland.  just no taste and staff never smile.  it is very cheap though so a star for that,2,Mr Wu
buffet but limited choices. affordable.,4,Mr Wu
good food for an incredible cheap price,5,Mr Wu
"all you can eat buffet, good selection of food from fried rice, noodles, sweet n sour chicken, beef in black bean sauce and loads more. great for hungry appetites or just a quick stop for a bite to eat. for the money you pay it's good food. have visited here several times.",4,Mr Wu
we only had a fork to use and a plate the man told us to sit down and pay first he was very rude and was talking in his language the whole time. toilets were filthy and didnt flush. and any wasted food you have to pay extra for. stay away from this place.,1,Mr Wu
"asked for money as soon as we sat down with no welcoming, watched everyone eat, small selection of food with most being dry. wouldnt recommend.",2,Mr Wu
very poor food qualityfor a chinese restaurant so close to china town this is a very bad example of chinese cuisine i definitely wont be returning,1,Mr Wu
nice little chinese restaurant. good prices.,4,Mr Wu
worth every penny,5,Mr Wu
vastly overpriced for the standard of the meal and service not great,2,Mr Wu
great place.  food good and plenty of it .good value  xx,5,Mr Wu
the food was cold. wasnt nice at all. no flavour. the people who worked there were rude. if i could give it no stars i would. it needs to be closed down.,1,Mr Wu
very nice food for the price they serve it for. the service was really enjoyable.,5,Mr Wu
"in the food lottery of life, this.tips the balance into happy land.never left unhappy or hungry and never regretted later, any restaurant that can do that for you, is something to be treasured.",5,Mr Wu
"little choice, food is no taste, the menu is bad at all. 7.5 for the person is too expensive at the menu they have.",1,Mr Wu
"it does the job, i can't complain, good value for money.",3,Mr Wu
"just left this place. absolutely trash!!  staff were so rude, spoke loudly in their language drowning out any chance of having a decent conversation. food was warm and not nice. will definitely advise you to spend the extra and go around the corner and have a better experience.",1,Mr Wu
good value - but cash only,5,Mr Wu
"excellent food at a very reasonable price, can't go wrong for a quick cheap meal in the centre of london",5,Mr Wu
really would not recommend.  the food is pretty poor quality - most of the starters and not edible! go somewhere else!,2,Mr Wu
"quick service help yourself buffet. not many options, but a good selection at a very reasonable price.",4,Mr Wu
very small but lovely food topped up regularly,4,Mr Wu
"decent food , good service ",5,Mr Wu
"cheapest buffet restaurant in china town, the food is ok but quite dried out, not a huge selection and the staff generally don't have a great attitude, refused to move tables for us and insisted our party sat seperated. the toilets aren't very nice, pretty ccramped and not clean. ok for a budget but otherwise go somewhere else",2,Mr Wu
very enjoyable,4,Mr Wu
 its hot and dirty on the inside and the food is barely edible. i should have known better than to come here. will not be returning. ,1,Mr Wu
"the food doesnt look really like chinese style; the food looks like been hours, not worth it to try",1,Mr Wu
my favourite chinese . 5 star,5,Mr Wu
horrible food and horrible staff. we founded lot of hairs in the food. staff is rude and agresive. place is dirty. don't waste your money,1,Mr Wu
bad food and none existent service.,1,Mr Wu
quick and convenient eat as much as you like chinese restaurant great for people in a hurry to make the theatre curtain up,2,Mr Wu
"cheapest buffet style restaurant in china town. 8 per person.very simple, no fancy. food is ok, not a great choice. recommended for hungry people rather than picky.",3,Mr Wu
"probably the cheapest restaurant in chinatown, no whistles and bells but great food for the price.",4,Mr Wu
it was an awful experience. there was a staff member (a woman) who was so rude and extremely lazy. she would bark at both the stuff and customers. she would watch customers eat and the food was sub par.,1,Mr Wu
food was okay very cheap worked out at 56 pound for 4 adults and 2 kids,3,Mr Wu
"food was luke warm at best. staff were very rude and dismissive. quite frankly, the buffet from hell. skip this one ",1,Mr Wu
this is an awesome place to buy chinese food in china town...what no better place to eat whilst standing under chinese lanterns listening too the local busker! and for only 5 takeaway or 7-95 eat in .....brilliant,5,Mr Wu
"excellent choices of food here at mr wu in china town. i had 2nd's my partner who normally doesn't eat much went 3 times to the food. we both really enjoyed the food and atmosphere,it was very busy though, but there is a upstairs too.",4,Mr Wu
"the food was okay, for the price (7,95) you can't get anything better but the service was abusive. they where checking and asking if we were finished every 3 minutes, i could feel the waitress in my back looking while we were eating. i felt very uncomfortable.",2,Mr Wu
"cost us 24 2 adults, 1 child, all you can eat, can't go wrong in centre of london for that, sat downstairs though, not quite sure about fire safety regs, you'd be pretty trapped down there if something were to happen upstairs, food hygiene seemed good and was tasty xx",3,Mr Wu
this used to be one of my favourite buffets around but the quality of the food has taken a steep dive downhill.they also put the prices up to make up for the horrible food. also it's always busy in there and every table has little to no elbow room.,1,Mr Wu
"great buffet food with a wide selection.only downsides were they oddly do not take card payments which is baffling for london. also, water was 3 a glass, so i'd sneak in some of your own soft drinks.food was hot and fresh, there was plenty of seating.",5,Mr Wu
"used to be popular due to reasonable prices. now is full of dubious clientelle. do they know how to spell ""hygiene""?",3,Mr Wu
"cheap, 8 pounds per person to eat, food is just acceptable but for all you can eat in london is ok",5,Mr Wu
an okay spot if you are in a hurry and don't mind buffet food. we popped in on our way to visiting the picturehouse cinema in picaddilly.so we were pressed for time.as is their want credit cards are not accepted do make sure that you have cash. relatively cheap so i will not complain.not likely to visit again.,3,Mr Wu
"good food, but the staff members might rush you.",3,Mr Wu
you can eat well amd fast for a small amount of money,5,Mr Wu
"for a takeway, it's great. we paid 10 pounds for two persons and had great food. hot, nice chinese buffet. rate it five for it cheapness. well done mr wu!",5,Mr Wu
"i've sat inside and it is too crowded, the seats are way to close to the buffet counter and you constantly have people brushing against you. however i much prefer the takeaway. the choice is great, the price is amazing and the quality of food is good too. can't fault it.",4,Mr Wu
food could of been warmer. more vegi options please,4,Mr Wu
"we seek this place out everyone we're in china town. i'm sure it's the lowest priced buffet option in the area. totally not fancy at all and it's a bit cosy seating wise, but the kids love it and it's not killed us yet, so that's something",5,Mr Wu
food is great but the staff not polite at all.,3,Mr Wu
"small buffet in chinatown, all you can eat for 6",4,Mr Wu
all you can eat at 10 . very good food. but be carefull what you put in your plate you will have to pay for what you don't eat.,5,Mr Wu

"i've been twice here for dinner and sat downstairs. once for hot pot (first hot pot ever!). food was very good and staff friendly but price could be a bit lower i think. it's not so well organised but both times i got table and food not waiting much. it's an informal family restaurant, worth a visit.",5,New China 中华楼
"went for the hotpot deal and it was great! quick service, friendly staff and a good range of food for unlimited hotpot",5,New China 中华楼

"what food we did have was nice. unfortunately we were given a starter,  waited half an hour, as people around us were served multiple courses, and then gave up on ever getting food. a fine example of why service charge should be at the customer's discretion.",2,New China 中华楼
"this is proper british-cantonese cuisine. service seemed really slow until we realised there are call buttons on the wall for those seated downstairs, then service was really speedy esp. given that the restaurant was full. wine list is a bit 1980s but good value for money, food runs to being spicy rather than bland.",4,New China 中华楼

best food i had in london chinatown.iclse is my favorite. special food for uni students.,5,Old Town 97
i had never disappointed here. better than others. ,4,Old Town 97
nice place to have a nice chinese meal after clubbing nearby. ,4,Old Town 97
good for food late but nothing exceptional and at 8 for a pint of beer it's pricey if you a fancy a drink.,3,Old Town 97
"been coming to this place for more than 20 years, open til 4am at weekends..highly recommend roast duck, char siu, crispy pork and egg fried rice",5,Old Town 97
"opens very late at night, so it is a great place to grab food after a night out, but do not expect the best quality of food in comparison to the other restaurants around the chinatown area.",4,Old Town 97
best chinese food in london! i've tried many but there is nowhere better!,5,Old Town 97

decent quality food and very quick service.,4,Old Town 97
food was very good from the set menu. only let down by the unfriendly service.,4,Old Town 97
busy chinese restaurant in the heart of china town. numerous floors,4,Old Town 97
better than average chinatown restaurant.,4,Old Town 97
great staff and food. best place to go if you hungry at night,5,Old Town 97
good food and ioen late,5,Old Town 97
great food that opens late into the night,5,Old Town 97
beef brisket ho fun was the business on a rainy day. in and out in 20 minutes (oo-er). take-out char kway teow (for consumption standing up) was generously proportioned too. they're open very late. will be back.,5,Old Town 97
"not sure why so many negative reviews, food was excellent and very quickly served. i agree that they could be more friendly but that is just standard chinese mannerisms, since the food was great and served amazingly quick i have no complaints.",5,Old Town 97
"asked for no nuts because of allergies.got told no nuts were in any of the dishes we wanted, and it should be completely safe.ruined the rest of the day, as there definitely was nuts in the dish - non-stop throwing up for hours (normally a sign of peanuts, which in other cases could be deadly).completely unacceptable, stay away!",1,Old Town 97
"they charge 2 for extra fresh cut chiliseriously? such a rip-off! it was taken off after our protest. rice is stale, dishes are average. you will be hassled, and waiters rude. typical cantonese canteen style. not that clean.",1,Old Town 97
"great food, get the off menu item, its called lse it comes standard as pork but you can ask for the chicken",5,Old Town 97
"this is one of my favorite restaurants in chinatown. service is very efficient. i would highly recommend their crispy duck, it is one of the best i've had.",4,Old Town 97
"convenient location, but service is hit or miss, food is ok for a quick asain fix but won't be going back soon",3,Old Town 97
liked the lse fried rice! kungpo chicken was disappointing.,3,Old Town 97
can't remember what it was called but the beef was sublime,5,Old Town 97
"great place to go when in the area, food is always very good. and stays open very late, so even more perfect to go after a night out!",5,Old Town 97
"roast meats are not bad, other dishes are so so.",3,Old Town 97
the go-to place for late night meal,5,Old Town 97
"had the crispy pork belly, which was excellent, although the rice was over fried, a but dry and hard in places.partner had the beef noodles which were delicious.food is very good, and served moments after ordering.the place itself isn't anything to look at, it's purely functional",4,Old Town 97
i don't recommend this restaurant.not worth spending mony herevery unfriendly staff ruined our holidaythere are bunch of other chinese restaurants in soho better than here,1,Old Town 97
poor customer service ever,1,Old Town 97
"horrible restaurant. they served pre made gyoza and when we were concerned they had not served us what we requested our server started pushing my arm away from the dish, physically touching my arm. so wierd and horrid.",1,Old Town 97
good to chill with drinking,3,Old Town 97
"yes service is bad - so bad that the waitors want to scam you of paying more than is the actual price, had this experience when ordering take-away and the waitor pretended to not have known what he had done - shameful staff here, if it continues this will be reported to the food standards agency",1,Old Town 97
it was utterly disgusting. the amount of salt poured into every dish can raise your blood pressure easily by a hundred. every dish is an abomination conjured to rip your taste buds out of your tongue. proceed to eat at your own risk.,1,Old Town 97
"some of the best tasting chinese in chinatown - not the place to go if you are looking for friendly service, however.",4,Old Town 97
"i was here back on 2015, and back again right now. i spent here like 3 times dinner during the past 2 weeks. foods is delicious, fast service, and good hospitality. feels like at home",5,Old Town 97
one of the best chinese restaurants in chinatown. i'd recommend getting the salted egg wings or squid and their hidden dish ''lse fried rice'' which is their special fried rice served with tender pork smothered in egg sauce and topped with a fried egg.,4,Old Town 97
the food was good but the waiters was so angry and aggressive. i felt like they were there to act mean. and they were throwing the cutleries and being rough,1,Old Town 97
very rude staff and below average food. what makes it worse is that they try and overcharge you! there are much better restaurants to go to nearby but if you go here make sure you remember how much your meal actually costs otherwise they will try it with you too!,1,Old Town 97
hands down the best customer service ive experienced. the food was great but the level of service just took it to another level. i think rick was the gentleman who served us. well definitely be going back,5,Old Town 97
"if you want to eat good chinese food, this place i will never recommend",1,Old Town 97
"five star purely for it does what you want. late night chinese food, pretty much a life saver if your after real chinese food late at night.",5,Old Town 97
"the food here far exceeded my expectations. excellent good, fast albeit a bit gruff service. they forgot one of the dishes i ordered and i had no way to tell if it was on my bill because it was hand written in chinese script.",4,Old Town 97
service was just bad! the waitress was so rude and agressive. we didn't want to pay the service charge because of this attitude but she did not let us and told us to just takeaway next time. additionally the food served was cold. not coming back.,1,Old Town 97
"be cautious with compulsive extra 10% fee for the just ok service.meat with rice(without any vegetables, except for 2 slices of cucumber) is good and delicious, but you can get the same things with vegetables in other store with same price.lemon tee is a bit bitter, quality of the tee could be better.",2,Old Town 97
dont even deserve a star.,1,Old Town 97
good taste. plenty food.,5,Old Town 97
not the best tbh.. soup was cold and noodles  were tasteless..  had to even ask for chilly. and additional charge was applied on payment desk..,2,Old Town 97
tried to scam us to pay more. rude,1,Old Town 97
very very friendly food was lovely make u feel welcome ,5,Old Town 97
i wish i could undo my experience at this place,1,Old Town 97
my family and i have a good experience. the menu is quite big. very good selection of soups and they are very tasty. stuff is very friendly and nice. i will recommend this restaurant ,5,Old Town 97
since i moved to london. this place has beenbeen and favourite place.,5,Old Town 97
great food in this small but busy chinese. brisket was nice and they go out the way to help you. very good,4,Old Town 97
"my co-workers and i order from here every friday to cure our hangovers, or just because we feel like being naughty on fridays. i recommend the beef ho fun noodles in black bean sauce. on my two occasions in store, service was fast but very basic. don't expect to be engaged or pampered much!",5,Old Town 97
"ordered chicken fried rice... nothing was fried in that dish and chicken was simply raw. when asked to bring a cooked meal they brought the same plate after microwaving it for a few minutes.. but hey, at least i'm still alive",1,Old Town 97
"busy little place. ordered the hainanese chicken rice. it was good but the chicken was a bit too mushy for my liking, although i am used to more elastic chicken. huge portions. head downstairs to the toilet and you might just hear some energetic chinese music being played in the kitchen!!",4,Old Town 97
we have two wontons noodles..the fillings are lovely..its not cheap 31..small seating areas most of the time have to share a table with someone else's..,4,Old Town 97
"not attentive waiters, even wrongly took three orders and didn't want to take responsibility. the food is good but the service is cringeworthy.",1,Old Town 97
it has a secret menu lse fried rice which is really good. other dishes are ok.,3,Old Town 97
"this is a one dish restaurant, we only go there because of the salt & pepper crab which is extremely tasty, but unfortunately all other dishes fall notably below those available in china town",3,Old Town 97
"an overpriced chinese eatery. food is mediocre at best, even before taking into account of the exorbitant prices. skip it unless its the last one standing.",1,Old Town 97
good place to go when others are closed. it costs slightly more because of that but would say the quality is higher than average,4,Old Town 97
great for late night after party feasting.,4,Old Town 97
"never tasted chinese food this bad!!! do yourself a favor and stay away from this restaurant! food quality 1/10, service 0/10, staff 1/10, hygiene 1/10. believe me or you can find out yourself.",1,Old Town 97
great food all the time 24/7 greatness,5,Old Town 97
"at 2 am? the food was delicious. we ordered the crispy belly pork, egg fried rice and beef with black been sauce and onions. what a great place especially after a night out. they have plenty of staff that will attend to you and tables available too. highly recommend.  ",5,Old Town 97
very oily food and taste so so. service is slow. wont come back again.,1,Old Town 97
really bad hygiene conditions. ordered a bubble tea and discovered a hair in my drink. the staff was also rude. food is okay but i'm never coming back. there tons of better places in china town. stay away from this one!!,1,Old Town 97
fast service and open late. best wings in london!,5,Old Town 97
wow.amazing food and a late closing.my new favourite chinese restaurant.,5,Old Town 97
"ate here with 3 friends last night and they were all instantly sick after eating the food here. not only that but the bill came in chinese not english so couldnt understand any of it, and we were massively over charged. wont be eating here again",2,Old Town 97
"good food, quick service but definitely on the pricey side. 60 meal for two vegetarians at a low end decor/ takeout chinese restaurant!",3,Old Town 97
staff are rude. they do not care if you are waiting. the food is okay tasty. the service really lets it all down. no culture barrier included,3,Old Town 97
"rude and terrible service, food not authentic",1,Old Town 97
average  food. more expensive than others around the immediate area. charges extra for anything extra including fresh chilli. not worth it in my opinion. also rude manager who adds the bill up in chinese so you dont exactly know what your paying for. go to the place next door,2,Old Town 97
best chinese in london for 3am dine in noodles.,5,Old Town 97
very good service and food 10/10,5,Old Town 97
"dont waste your time with this place, terrible staff particularly the manager.they lied about prices and purposely try to overcharge people. food half decent but not worth the hassle.never again",1,Old Town 97
it was late and still had a decent meal at midnight..,5,Old Town 97
"good chinese food, the restaurant was a bit dirty and too small.",3,Old Town 97
"i can't believe there's such a ppace in london like this. so third world, attitude's unimaginably uncivilized. the management's so ignorant of londoners' customer care. my friend and i tried to understand the behavior but it was so offensively boorish. it was a mistake dining there!",1,Old Town 97
"overcharging, tourist trap.",1,Old Town 97
"shame on you, old town 97!! you're a mess! sort out your deliveroo because you're stealing money from customers for food that you're incapable to make or deliver! what a mess!! don't advertise that you deliver food if you can't do so!! incompetent....waste of time 1 star is 1 too many.",1,Old Town 97
"my favourite chinese restaurant in the area. i always get takeaway when im able to and its perfect for wholesome chinese food even at 4am (which is not the case for most places at that time)highly recommend for dinner, or a 4am snack ;)",5,Old Town 97
i had noodles with chopped pork on christmas day and it was just amazing! one of the best i've ever eaten! definitely will come back if i'm near china town!,5,Old Town 97
great small chinese restaurant. very reasonable prices. food is very tasty and plenty of it. spiced nicely in my case. chicken in black bean sauce. house wine was very nice. always seems to be busy,4,Old Town 97
"bad hygiene conditions , rude staff.",1,Old Town 97
"love this place, it has flaws such as rude staff that speak way to loud but if you know what to order you are at the right chinese spot in china town!",5,Old Town 97
not good as its mentioned in all the review.  i ordered thefried rice and wonton noodles soup.  the fired rice is really dry and hard to swallow.  the wonton noodle soup has no taste at all.  overall not a good choice if you are looking for authentic chinese food.,1,Old Town 97
must try the lse fried rice. good old chinese fast food,5,Old Town 97
"food's not bad, but the service was terrible.  rude waiting staff, poor speaking tone, dismissive, inconsiderate.",2,Old Town 97
"high recommend! lse fried rice is my favorite, best chinese food in china town.",5,Old Town 97
"the best thing to get here is the cantonese duck and rice, probably one of the best i've had it in most places worldwide but everything on the menu here is top quality. they don't use that low density meat you find with many chinese restaurants they use proper cuts of steak and chicken.",5,Old Town 97
opens till early hours of the morning so good for when you're stumbling in after a night out but food and service subpar.,2,Old Town 97
paid 20 for two plates of inedible vegetables. terrible service and terrible food. literally couldn't even eat the food. i told them i was severely allergic to shellfish and they essentially ignored me.,1,Old Town 97
decent place and lots of choices. price quality is about right.,3,Old Town 97
nice noodles,5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"amazing food. i give four star because the service is quite poor, but seriously good price and excellent food.",4,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"pretty good food and the sesame oil chicken hit the spot on the cold day. a bit expensive though, for what it is, even for london. good for occasional taiwanese eating out. the atmosphere is authentically crowded and simple too (for those who like that, i know i do)",4,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"food is nice,portion size is pretty small. i don't know why i am paying service charge since it's non-existant",2,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"the food is great but the service is terrible. the staff are impolite, not happy that they gave my judging eyes when i told them i have no coins.",3,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"great price to taste ratio; hard to find a cheaper place in the area. i recommend the fried chicken. it's a bit sweeter than you might expect, but very nice. ",5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"fastastic taiwanese restaurant! quite authentic, food is great!",5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
small little restaurant with great food and the friendliest owners ever !!!!,5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"decent taiwanese comfort food, but overpriced for the small-ish portion sizes. very cramped seating area and cash-only with a mandatory service charge for eat-in.",3,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
food is nice. portion can be more generous,4,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
the most authentic taiwanese restaurant in london that ive found.,5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
food and price are reasonably great. service is just okay,5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
cute traditional taiwanese street food place.,4,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
great food and friendly service,5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
tasty food and great bubble tea.,5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
food was authentic and tasted very nice. slightly pricey for its portion but i would still go back again.,5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
the fried chicken cutlet was very delicious and price reasonable! did not disappoint.,4,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"rude and emotionless waitress, small potions and the prices are like 3x of those in taiwan",1,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"the service is bad, the food is bad as well, if you really want to taste taiwanese food, you should not come here.",1,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"great service, cute wooden interior and such a lovely reminder of the flavours of home. not 100% the flavours you get in taiwanese night markets but probably the closest you can get in london!",5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
cash only. great taiwan food.,5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
really good taiwanese food,5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"the food is good, but the customer service is really really bad. i dont know why the restaurant is cash only, and they only accept to pay the notes rather than coins. he said we wasted his time, and a lot of people are waiting for us. actually we only wasted his time for less than 2mins!",1,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
please dont go to this restaurant!!!!the service its terrible. the owner or administrator literally yelled at us because we stayed 5 minutes talking after the plates were removed. he was so violent that i'll file a report with the police. by so far was the worst restaurant experience of all my life.,1,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"very small but a unique dining experience. interesting and delicious drinks. if you like random pig bits (feet, etc) you'll love this. the taiwanese sausage is excellent too. also try their salt and pepper squid which is very authentic.",5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"tiny space, but the food is really good. fried chicken, pork sausage, spicy beef noodle soup, chicken noodle soup with sesame oil are dishes that i normally go for.",5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"really liked this little cafe. home style taiwanese food is not easy to find in london. noodles are really fresh and delicious, as was salt & pepper squid and chicken. portion sizes are sensible and cost is a real bargain. will definitely stop by again",4,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"as a taiwanese, the food is trash honestly. even the beef flavored instant noodle is better comparing the beef noodle there..fried chicken tastes dry with thick breaded. the taro milk tea was obviously blending with artificial flavor. faked af..last..even my grumpy grandma is nicer than the waitresses.. disgrace of taiwan",1,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"authentic taiwanese street food, affordable food that will not disappoint. the taiwanese braised pork rice (3.50) and the taiwanese sausages (6.50) are must tries! this is a small restaurant with limited seating, so expect a short wait of around 10 min if you visit during rush hours.",4,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"a little pricey for taiwanese street food, but understandable given its in central london. its definitely the best classic bubble tea in town.",4,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"i love taiwanese food but this place is such a let down. the ""signature"" beef noodle is steeped in oil to make up for a lack of ten necessary ingredients to make it a proper broth. others have said enough about the bad service - cold faces without a smile.",1,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"great taiwanese food, recommend!",5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
taiwanese street food.  in many individual size portions.,5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"lovely taiwanese food, if the service can make the customers feels like in taiwan it must perfect",5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
surprisingly ok for a tiny hole in the wall,5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"tried their crispy chicken and oyster noodles, both delicious. menu with pictures is a great help",3,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
classic taiwanese dishes! great for a quick bite.,4,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"really amazing, my god the fried chicken, oyster omelette, minced pork noodles were off the charts. just the best thing ever! brings me back to when i was in taiwan. (singaporean here)",5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"very nice hearty taiwanese food, noodles to fried chicken and perfect steamed vegetables. and still friendly. a bit cramped but it's street food!",5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
really yummy and traditional taste of taiwanese food. felt so happy when i had my salt and pepper chicken!!,5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
the taste is not like any restaurant in taiwan very disappointing all my friends can cook better than the chef,1,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
love this place. the best taiwanese restaurant in london and very reasonable prices,5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
didn't eat here but the staff were lovely. we were having a drink in the pub next door who wouldn't let our children use the toilet due to the license but these guys offered to let the kids use their staff toilet. outstanding.... thank you.,5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
not great if vegetarian but very friendly staff and good service.,3,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"horrible customer service. truly one of the worst customer service i have ever had at a restaurant. staff were rude, condescending and unwilling to help customers.",1,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"traditional taiwanese food in the heart of london. loved it since i have been there for the first time 3 years ago. tiny place, but def worth to squeeze in",5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
a small place just off the main china town strip. food is very good. tables are  slightly small and was slightly rushed when you have finished. very typical for a small place that need the table. food made up for it,4,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"really good and local taiwanese food. although i'm not taiwanese, the food made me remember the time when i'd been living in taiwan.",5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"on the expensive side and my noodle soup was pretty much only noodles. very cramped. staff friendly enough, other dishes were tasty.",3,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
i am never let down at this small taiwanese restaurant. it's a consistent favourite!! i recommend the noodle soup and salt and pepper chicken,5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"small restaurant, expect to share tables with others.typical hong kong style service (not friendly service).accepts cash only with 10% on top.",1,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
best taiwanese food ive had in london. located in central london between chinatown and soho. i recommend the spicy beef noodles. taiwanese sausage and chicken cutlet were also very good. yes the place is small and cramped but worth a try if you never had taiwanese food before. i thought the prices were decent. id go back again.,4,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"food was tasty and reasonably priced. place doesn't look like much, is cramped and the waitresses don't smile much but wouldn't call them rude. the place feels pretty authentic, and my friend said the food reminded him of home, so we all thought it was great!",5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"great taiwanese food in chinatown. food is authentic, prices are reasonable.  this place is cash only! tables are shared and you can only be seated once your whole group has arrived.",4,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"these guys do not mess about when it comes to hot food.  lesson number 1.   the broth was like a chilli mace at times ( in a good way). service was quick, to the point. no faffing. had the beef noodles based on all the reviews. was good.  little oily towards the end.  .worth a visit.",3,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
super good! quite authentic taiwan flavor. staff are friendly.,5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"the food was not bad, close to real taiwanese food. but the services could be better. i knew it's busy but it's not customers' fail, please don't wear a long face.",3,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
good food! awful service! awful!,2,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
"needed a quick meal before the theatre, and this was very quick. food tasted authentic and service was fast and brusque which suited us just fine. so much better than the average chinese restaurants in the area.will come again",5,Old Tree Daiwan Bee
when i lived in london. i missed the food in taipei.i went there with my friend. the taste of  is almost the same at home. and i can hearchinese there. it warmed my heart.,4,Old Tree Daiwan Bee

the place serves large portions and for affordable pricing. friendly staff. they never disappoint.,5,Olle Korean Barbecue
"while the ""olle beef selection"" tasted amazing, the service was not doing its part in making the experience enjoyable. no assistance was provided (and i don't think we looked like we really knew what we were doing), no refill of salad once the plate was empty, no comment on what sides would make sense with our order. just nothing.",3,Olle Korean Barbecue

everyone was very nice and provide excellent service with high quality products. the previous reviews don't do it service.,5,P2bus
good,4,P2bus
really expensive. box of sheet masks that was about 9 in a beauty store in hong kong was almost 50 in the shop. seriously?,1,P2bus
"i thought it was awesome cos there are so many korean/japanese skincare products, but they priced one mask at 8.00 and an eyelash curler at fricking 24 lol. idk about import prices but this definitely exceeds import prices. stuff like this would cost way less in that country, i'm pretty sure they multiply each price by 8 :/",1,P2bus
absolutely awful experience. super high price markups and very poor service. the staff used lame argument when dealing with me the customer.  i personally wouldn't shop in such a place any more.,1,P2bus
unreasonable high price and great range of selection,2,P2bus
extremely expensive... buy online.,1,P2bus
"quite pricey,products in the shop is excellence, but service in there is so poorly like below zero!you don't get much help or even recommendations.staff seem so unfriendly and uninvited.",1,P2bus
nice!,4,P2bus
"lot's of product range, lady at store was very helpful and nice.",5,P2bus
very very expensive compared to online. not organiswd well howevrr has lots of products. the sales people were on there phones and were not helpful would not recommend thisover sjopping online,2,P2bus
incredibly overpriced and the staff was not very helpful.,1,P2bus
its not the best.,1,P2bus
too expensive.,2,P2bus
prices are jacked up but the staff was really helpful and rather friendly. ,4,P2bus
very bad,1,P2bus
what is this,5,P2bus
too expensive,1,P2bus
"grande variedade em produtos coreanos. a loja  pequena, mas muito encantadora. pesquisei muito aqui no brasil antes de viajar para londres.  foi muito melhor do que eu imaginei.  um universo de k-beauty no centro da cidade ",5,P2bus
so good! and reasonably priced and reasonable wait time for our food!,5,Pho & Bun
"great food, interesting combinations. had a bao bun burger, which was perfectly cooked and had a nice slaw on top. really cool vibe.",5,Pho & Bun
"bun burgers were soaking wet and cold due to the piled high salad that was saturated with water. atmosphere was non-existent, dance music pumping and the place wasnt sparkling clean. a sad dinner of a bank holiday monday.",1,Pho & Bun
food was ok really disappointed by the very small calamari dish they had on there lunch menu which cost and extra two pounds...the bao bun was very taste but again for the price wasn't filling.i would say my colleague ordered better so will probably come again.,4,Pho & Bun
amazing food on shaftsbury avenue. the bo sat vang pho is next level. a must try are the fresh summer rolls with tiger prawns. will definitely return at some point in the future.,5,Pho & Bun
"delicious dishes, especially the bun hue with authentic vietnamese taste. service is rather bad as the restaurant is crowded most of the time, we once had to wait 20 minutes for the menu to be brought out.recommended if youre not in a rush for a quick service",4,Pho & Bun
very good food and nice ambient.,4,Pho & Bun
"truly splendid pho, the stock is delicious. portions are generous, stick to just one starter so you can fully enjoy your pho. if you're having a bao burger you might be okay ordering more!",5,Pho & Bun
best pho in london!,5,Pho & Bun
"nice small vietnamese.the food was good and fresh, our pho needed some more salt.the stuff was friendly and the 2 course meal makes a very good value for money.",4,Pho & Bun
"good food, place is a little tiny and customer service was not too great",4,Pho & Bun
really great atmosphere and food and the staff are incredibly friendly. we had the special platter for starter and pork belly bao burgers and the grilled bananas for dessert and a few cocktails and couldn't fault any of it. definitely would recommend!,5,Pho & Bun
"really nice food and staff. got the platter for starters and the waitress was very helpful, telling us what was what and what sauce was best with each. also had some of the bao burgers which were very tasty. this was finished by the peanut brittle and banana ice cream which was also great. would definitely recommend people check it out.",5,Pho & Bun
"fantastic steamed bao burgers, can highly recommend!",5,Pho & Bun
enjoyed our meal. good value. good service.,5,Pho & Bun
left a bit underwhelmed and still hungry. ordered the bun burger which sounds great on paper but is missing something considering the price 8-10 for a burger. maybe if i got pho it would be a different story but its unlikely i'll come back to try it.,2,Pho & Bun
delicious food and great service. local small and loud when is crowded. they serve take away as well. better go with reservation. highly recommended!!!,5,Pho & Bun
delicious and freshly made good.,5,Pho & Bun
"ate here a few months ago, i would eat here again if in the area. good pho and good starter. small and compact but nice wait staff who will make the effort to accommodate.",4,Pho & Bun
"absolutely delicious pho!! the best chicken pho ive had in london. spring rolls are great here too - very crispy and fresh. the lunch deal cant be beat either. my only complaint is the vegetarian bun, while tasty, is pretty small.",4,Pho & Bun
loved it... great food.  this is a nice little restaurant with more seating downstairs.  i would definitely recommend the food here. the vietnamese coffee is nice and sweet and gives you the boost required.  worth a visit.,5,Pho & Bun
"a chain of vietnamese restaurants. pretty authentic. although, of courses, to be properly authentic you'd be sat on a road side in a tiny plastic chair eating food freshly served to you from a massive bowl of pho. other than that, pretty authentic taste.",3,Pho & Bun
delicious food.  cosy place.  great friendly service,5,Pho & Bun
great groupon deal.. 9 dishes and a drink for each one for 40! good was great and fast service. highly recommended!,5,Pho & Bun
brilliant food and service,5,Pho & Bun
"has a great meal here, a tad cosy but good food and drink",4,Pho & Bun
delicious ramen. try also their special burger. you wont regret it. but the best part is the waitress wh served us. she was amazing.,5,Pho & Bun
went on a groupon offer of five courses and a glass of prosecco. did not disappoint! fresh tasty food and great pho. recommend booking though as gets very busy,5,Pho & Bun
food was good but not amazing however the prices suited. the atmosphere and decor was pretty nice.,4,Pho & Bun
"reasonably good value as a tenner for lunch special, friendly and efficient service. unfortunate the pho didn't have much flavour to it, so i won't be back. maybe if they served it with birds eye chili's, fish sauce and lime instead of lemon?",3,Pho & Bun
food is so good but the wine is expensive for the tiny amount given ..,4,Pho & Bun
the place to go if you want vietnamese food !!!,5,Pho & Bun
delicious traditional pho at a very good price,5,Pho & Bun
one of the best burger experiences ive ever had,5,Pho & Bun
"super delicious, light yet flavorful pho, crunchy summer rolls, friendly and efficient staff.the midweek lunch deal is a steal.worth a visit if you're in the area.",5,Pho & Bun
"a little gem in the west end. great quality food, with portions large enough to share at a reasonable price",4,Pho & Bun
nice food and service. set lunch meal 9.95 for an appetizer and main is the best value lunch during my short trip in london,4,Pho & Bun
"i wanted to try this dish and it was amazing. we came here because the food looked delicious, we werent disappointed! its a quaint place where you wait to get into the restaurant. its that busy of a place which means its good.",5,Pho & Bun
the food was excellent! it was so busy however pedro looked after us and made us feel really special on my wife's birthday so thank you.,5,Pho & Bun
the most amazing vietnamese food i ever had. highly recommended. fast service and friendly staff.,5,Pho & Bun
"really good food, fast service. great value for money. very impressed.",5,Pho & Bun
the food here is delicious but its a little tight in space. a woman at the table next to me knocked her glass of water and i ended up with a soaking wet leg. staff could also be a little more attentive - it was difficult to get another drink and ask for the bill. 10/10 for food though,4,Pho & Bun
"great place. exceptional pho bo, great service, highly recommended! would definitely come here again.",5,Pho & Bun
"best vietnamese food i've ever had. nice atmosphere, friendly staff and amazing food! great value for money. would definitely go again",5,Pho & Bun
"the service was good. the fried squid is quite crispy. pho with beef was very tasty. the fried rice is much beyond perfect. the sausages, tiger prawns, paprikas in it just hittrd the sweet point of my tongue. i'll recommend it to everyone who want to try vietnam food in london.",5,Pho & Bun
amazing food! we visited for dinner and had to queue for 10 or so minutes but boy was it worth it. every dish was delicious and service was fast and friendly. will be returning.,5,Pho & Bun
"super small restaurant with tiny tables which may feel a bit cramped at times. food is better than i expected, not too greasy. unfortunately no pho that i can eat but the bowls looks really tasty. decent pricing for dishes. service is a little hit and miss so dont expect the full works. overall pretty good, would visit again",3,Pho & Bun
"wow - best pho we ever had.highly recommended.nice atmosphere friendly staff and great food.we also had the honey pork bun which was incredible. light and tasty at the same time.we will come here again and again and again, thank you.came here a second time. wow consistently perfect - you have to try this out.",5,Pho & Bun
"order 3 starters, pork ribs, pork belly bun and spring roll. very very good but a little bit pricey.had pho soup, best soup so far i have tasted in london.will i go again, yes i will. worth the money.table is too small and limited seats in the shop, small  restaurant.",4,Pho & Bun
"lovely food and service. as most places, can get very cramped and right up against a stranger's shoulder and conversation. not the best place to discuss secret plots. perhaps good for giving bad news to someone so they don't make a scene? either way, if you want good vietnamese food next to the theatres, this is a great choice.",4,Pho & Bun
"food was very average. i had the lemongrass tofu burger. the tofu is tasteless and does not really go well with the salad. the sweet potatoe fries were good. music was loud, waiter was nice",3,Pho & Bun
"tried the 6 course tasting menu, and an extra bun-burger and sweet potato chips to share for two. excellent.",5,Pho & Bun
best pho i've had since actually eating it in vietnam 5 years ago.,5,Pho & Bun
great pho - great value! quickly has become a regular stop for me when in london.,5,Pho & Bun
"lovely food, best to book if you want yo visit this place as quiet popular. always love vietnamese food must try my favourite is pho noodles xin ciaooooo",4,Pho & Bun
good food but uncomfortable seating,4,Pho & Bun
"good authentic food, that was fresh and not greasy at all. they do a good set menu, 3 courses and a drink for 23 and day any time thats good value",5,Pho & Bun
cute little spot with perfectly done food and gorgeous cocktails. must book to avoid disappointment. a little gem.,5,Pho & Bun
"pho was amazing, the squid fry was the besy. the summer spring rolls were ok. portions are fairly large. do try the squid fry. yum yum",5,Pho & Bun
"i never expected to find such amazing food right on shaftesbury avenue. blown away by the quality of the chilli squid and bbq pork pho bun especially,  definitely going back",5,Pho & Bun
it was very busy the service was good the food was nice i recommend to anybody,1,Pho & Bun
"went for pre theatre meal. service friendly and  very good. order came quickly. food was excellent. some great cocktrails too. popular place, so always a good sign. would recommend.",5,Pho & Bun
"please go pho soho but not this one. services there is much better than this one. waiting for 10 mins to order in a peak time, although there were 3 servers working. waving my hand for 5 times still no one care about me. a guy saw me and still chatting to others. just keep these useless staffs lol.",1,Pho & Bun
"even when crowded the service was quick and precise , we were given good advice. maybe not the best food ever but warm , big portion and fresh",4,Pho & Bun
"cosy place and good food! the three dishes in the pictures, plus one coke and a beer costed 38.",4,Pho & Bun
"tables are pretty small, but i cannot fault the food in any way. the pho is amazing. my family and i returned 4 times on a week long holiday and i will definitely go back if i'm in london again.",5,Pho & Bun
really good experience - the food was full of flavour and the service was excellent.,5,Pho & Bun

nice and compact vietnamese restaurant. it has slightly lost its authenticity but still a nice place with tasty food. staff are friendly and the beer cold.,4,Pho & Bun
good food and relatively cheap. we came in right as they were closing up but they served us anyway. get the fried doughstick!,5,Pho & Bun
delicious food and good service.,4,Pho & Bun
very tasty noodles and spring/summer rolls. i am also quite allergic to nuts which can be an issue but the menu was very clearly marked and the staff made me feel safe in my choices.,4,Pho & Bun
"good pho restaurant in china town, london. they have a set lunch menu for under 10, or a menu with four courses for 15.99.i went for pho with tender beef and a pork bao, with pan fried prawn cake to start.for desert i had the pandan and coconut panacotta and the coconut snow ice coffee.",4,Pho & Bun
"lovely  food . normally busy so need to book, worth noting do theatre menus and offers with time out .  gets warm inside often though",5,Pho & Bun
loved the freshness of the ingredients and the service was fast!,4,Pho & Bun
"excellent food, lovely service. pho was the real deal. had to wait a bit even with a reservation but totally worth it !",5,Pho & Bun
"if you are looking for an authentic vietnamese restaurant this is not the place to go, we loved the vibe and the interior design",1,Pho & Bun
average place. no vegan pho although the menu doesn't specify it. the bao was really not impressive. curry was ok,2,Pho & Bun
"rustic looking vietnamese decor but all tables very close together and feels claustrophobic. service was friendly but felt rushed. the starters were fairly good, but i wasn't impressed with the beef pho. altogether not a bad place but nothing special.",3,Pho & Bun
good but not as good as some old viet places around hoxton station,4,Pho & Bun
tasty tasty! mains and starters were fantastic,5,Pho & Bun
great cozy little place for lunch . service was fast and friendly and the pho was sublime .deffo up there with the best pho iv had before .,5,Pho & Bun

excellent. order from the theater menu for good value,5,Pho & Bun
friendly staff and very tasty food. good quality/price lunch menu.,5,Pho & Bun
"get together among friends.. highly recommended, book a table if four or more as you will be seated down stairs, restaurant is cozy but the vibe can be loud depending on the night and guests, they have a la carte & set menus.. lovely dishes, ambience & most of all customer service :)",5,Pho & Bun
i dont think waiting for a bun for over 20 minutes is reasonable,3,Pho & Bun
nice vietnamese restaurant serving decent pho and good spring rolls,4,Pho & Bun
"tried a few vietnamese restaurants on a trip to london, and this place was by far the best one. both bun bo hue and and bun thit nuong was really tasty. the interior of the restaurant is nice and service was good.",4,Pho & Bun
"amazing food , great service",5,Pho & Bun
friendly stuff and really tasty vietnamese food. i tried vietnamese food for the first time and waiter helped me with my order. price is also good. only disadvantage is the space. not that much inside.,5,Pho & Bun
"very good pho, taste is quite authentic and quite a good selection on the menu. price is also reasonable.",4,Pho & Bun
"so far, it is the best vietnamese food that i tried in london. try the pho and the bbq pork. the soup was done in 24 hours. the taste is so great ..",5,Pho & Bun
great restaurant for vietnamese food. the pho was very delicious. a little bit cramped inside but the staff were excellent.,5,Pho & Bun
"nice to try, bought as a present on groupon for me, great service but over priced in my opinion.",4,Pho & Bun
service is bad,1,Pho & Bun
"ordered a bao bun as a delivery, and was extremely disappointed. the bun was so unloved, i removed the contents and replaced with odd bits i had at home. poor experience",2,Pho & Bun
"amazing, food is of high quality. recommend to reserve. i always go for the tiger prawn burger and sweet potato fries. usually costs around 20 per head with a drink.",5,Pho & Bun
i enjoyed the starters over the main. i feel like the presentation was more important in their dishes over taste and portion. great atmosphere but the food isn't amazing.,2,Pho & Bun
top!,4,Pho & Bun
amazing food.  in fact we enjoyed it so much we went before a show then after the show for 2nds and dessert. coconut snow. honey roasted pork buns. yum. ,4,Pho & Bun

"taste: 3.5 because it's not quite authentic, need to work on the texture. decor & staff: 5 very nice concept.",4,Pho & Bun
good tasty food with decent portion sizes. they seemed to be having slight issues with the timing of he food but the staff were very apologetic and helpful. definitely worth a visit.,4,Pho & Bun
tasty dishes - good service,4,Pho & Bun
for me as a pho-lover is this restaurant one the best places i've ever been in london in looking for how does this vietnamese soup tastes. pho was so delicious with loads of fresh ingredients. i could feel more comfortable if tables were bit bigger.,4,Pho & Bun
"i had avoided this place, maybe because its hard to find a good vietnamese restaurant, but the bun cha there brought me back to hanoi",5,Pho & Bun
the staff were friendly and attentive. the prawn pancake was amazing and the pho was fantastic. definitely one of the best vietnamese restaurants in london.,5,Pho & Bun
one of the best vietnamese cuisine in london!!,5,Pho & Bun
when you get a set menu the starters are small but they do taste good. mains are very tasty . i may come back for the 3rd time soon. service is not great if that was quality then maybe they could reach 5 star,4,Pho & Bun
"the pho  is the star of the show, cooked over 24 hours.",5,Pho & Bun

lovely food quick service,5,Pho & Bun
amazing staff!!! very helpful and very clean,5,Pho & Bun
"good food, reasonably priced but too many tables crammed together for comfort on street level. probably better downstairs.",4,Pho & Bun
"very nice vietnamese food. pho (beef noodle soup) is 80% authentic. the other dishes are excellent, especially the very special steamed bun burger!",5,Pho & Bun
the pho broth wasn't as complex as i expected it should be,3,Pho & Bun
"i had the crispy tofu pho and for about 11 a pop, this is a good stumble upon place for the next time you're in central london and need a quick bite! generous servings and well done broth, we left feeling pretty satisfied. the desserts look like they're a winner too - somethings to try next time perhaps. ",4,Pho & Bun
"pleasant food and customer service. although the place is quite small and had to wait a bit, it was a good overall experience. perfect for anyone who wants quick but good food!",4,Pho & Bun

"will be back again, and again, and again.",5,Pho & Bun
food was lovely but the table service was not so good. shame because we both really enjoyed the food.,3,Pho & Bun
"delicious and well priced. the tofu bao burger was a little bland, but oh my lorrrrd, the vermicelli with crispy tofu and the spring rolls were divine. i only wish they offered vegetarian-friendly pho (currently you can only have it with a meat-based stock). will be back!",4,Pho & Bun
delicious veggie pho and great value lunch menu,5,Pho & Bun
nice viet food. papaya salad and steamed burger from the lunch menu were excellent. some might find it small but i think its good size.,4,Pho & Bun

"great traditional viet, nice location and nice staff.",4,Pho & Bun
one of the best tasting beef pho i've ever had. noodles and the broth were on point. however this restaurant isn't for the hungry or big eaters. portions are quite small but super delicious,5,Pho & Bun
finally went to see what the fuss was about with this place. good food and good atmosphere so we weren't disappointed at all! would certainly go back. it is worth looking on some table booking websites as you can get set menus that aren't advertised through the pho & bun website where you get better value for money!,4,Pho & Bun
"nice food and place, portions a little too small",4,Pho & Bun
"vietnamese restaurant serving pho, buns and fried dishes in an authentic style. tastes are fresh, prices reasonable, service a little patchy, but definitely worth a try!",4,Pho & Bun

staff were friendly enough but some of the food was fairly standard. pricey for quality,3,Pho & Bun
"love it, great food and service",5,Pho & Bun
the food ace delicious the right amounti had so much fun they became my personal dj voluntary playing music and free deserts to make my birthday extra special (they knew it was my birthday last minute) yet still out of good will they celebrated with me. thank you staff you are awesomeworth it guys,5,Pho & Bun

"chicken pho was not bad, the spring roll and the fried rice was so so. the tofu pho was a bit bland.",3,Pho & Bun
"exceeded our expectations , honestly it was my friends birthday and apart from the food being so delicious. it was the customer service that really blew our minds . when they found it was my friends birthday they went out of their way to do a birthday treat for her . i will definitely come here again ! ",5,Pho & Bun
amazing set menu and great service! couldn't believe how cheap it was for such good food,5,Pho & Bun
nice authentic vietnamese food. and quite affordable with lunch menu!,5,Pho & Bun
"love the food. i wish the tables and stools were wider, not a lot of space between people.",4,Pho & Bun
"hot, tasty pho. i asked for no coriander and they did as requested. their cold vietnamese drip coffee was super tasty. uses lemon instead of lime in the pho which is unusual. the sweet potato veggie curry is delicious!",5,Pho & Bun
wonderful place ! really kind people and tasty food. good prices. special thanks to the nice greek server  our son enjoyed his birthday !,5,Pho & Bun
"its such a shame as i never even got to try the main dish. was told had to wait 20 minutes; 30 minutes later i was still waiting and no update. asked them how much longer it would be and they said 10 minutes. asked for the bill, total came to 4.46 and had to pay 5 because it was the minimum by card. terrible service",1,Pho & Bun
"comfortable vietnamese restaurants based at chinatown. set lunch only 9.95 (main course with starter), and they got serve for vegetarian food as well. friendly service and taste good ",4,Pho & Bun
good food slow stuff,4,Pho & Bun
"cocktails were great but staff were pushy in trying to turn over tables. it was a busy saturday evening, but so rude to make us leave when we were about to order dinner!",3,Pho & Bun
"small restaurant that does a vegetarian and non vegetarian set menu. the quality is good, but portion sizes are a little small. the tables are close together so it can feel a little cramped. more seating is available downstairs. the staff are also polite and helpful. booking is advised for dinner later in the week or at the weekend. ",4,Pho & Bun
"cozy, nicely decorated, quick service, and the food is goooood. the chilli squid is fantastic and the beef  bun is absolutely delicious. try the flan if you still have space for dessert.",5,Pho & Bun
"went in on a busy saturday, was shown to a table and given menus. 5 minutes later a waiter came up to us, we assumed to take our order, only to be told that someone had already booked the table and would we like to sit downstairs instead? given service like that we chose to leave and eat elsewhere altogether.",1,Pho & Bun
"great service, not too expensive, authentic cuisine. loved it!",5,Pho & Bun
the set menu is awesome. so is the pork belly bao. i love the waiter that just took some initiative and brought us more beer when we had finished the first round.,5,Pho & Bun
"nicely decorated for a small place, seats were a little uncomfortable but food was good and set menu is good",4,Pho & Bun
it was one of the worst meals i had in a while. the aubergine taste like it was dipped in the oil that was used 5 times over. the pho  broth totally lacked flavour. there are better choices out there for good vietnamese,1,Pho & Bun
bbq short rib and chicken japenese bun is what i had. it was lovely will definitely go again for quick eat,5,Pho & Bun
"food was delicious. had the ribs and beef rolls. lovely. took about 25min before we got our mains. the steamed bbq honey pork bao burger was delicious.  would deff go back. the time out offer is only really worth it in the evening, otherwise you can get 2 course for 10 during lunch.",4,Pho & Bun
great spot in soho west end/theatreland. amazing 4 course meal super experience and attentive staff - check it out,5,Pho & Bun
lovely food great service,5,Pho & Bun
"went for the chicken pho to take away. service was really slow - ended up waiting 20min when originally told it would take 5. broth and noodles are ok, but you only get a few scraps of quite dry chicken so the 8 price tag doesn't really seem worth it. will avoid in the future.",2,Pho & Bun
"food was absolutely lovely and our waiter was very pleasant. it's quite small as you walk in, but there's loads of seating downstairs if it gets too busy. i'll definitely be trying out the new restaurant opening in oxford.",5,Pho & Bun
amasing food. good portions. gluten free.,5,Pho & Bun
used to be good but now the portion sizes look much smaller and the new staff are grumpy and rude.,1,Pho & Bun
lovley restaurant with great staff and testy food.,4,Pho & Bun
they have a secret room downstairs so even if it looks crowded ask for table you will propably get one.,4,Pho & Bun

great pho soup with beef at a very reasonable price,4,Pho & Bun
"so good! we tried the crispy lemongrass tofu, tofu summer rolls, the grilled aubergine and sweet potato bao burger, and the tofu bao burger. ive been a vegetarian for 16 years and this is some of the best tofu ive ever had! the summer rolls were also delicious and refreshing. i wish i lived in london so i could return frequently.",5,Pho & Bun
very nice ambiance and excellent food. around 20 per person including drinks.,5,Pho & Bun
"food is nice, a bit expensive. lots of rice based food, so it is a good idea for gluten free diets. but contactless doesn't work ;(",4,Pho & Bun
good food but quite unattentive service,3,Pho & Bun
great week day lunch deal ... 2 courses for 9.50. good service. great food. ,4,Pho & Bun
definitely satisfied my pho cravings since moving to london from sydney. the soup was absolutely delicious. will surely try more off the menu next time!,5,Pho & Bun
"pho and bun is the best vietnamese i've had in london. the meat spring rolls are fresh and delicious, the bun is tasty, and the pho was the best tasting broth since visiting vietnam. the decor is pretty trendy too.",5,Pho & Bun
the buns were amazing. big in size and tasted great. slightly disappointed about the sweet potato fries as they weren't crispy.would recommend checking it out though!,3,Pho & Bun
the pho is really good! we were just back from a holiday in vietnam. didn't expect to find a pho restaurant with such authentic favor in london. well done! ,5,Pho & Bun
"very cosy and yummy restaurant. the burgers are delish, and the vegetarian version comes almost guilt free (all considered a light meal). i almost had food envy looking at the person in front of me with a bowl of sticky rice and pork, that must have been amazing!",5,Pho & Bun
"friendly service, good food, great cocktails, restaurant is small and tables are a bit cramped.",4,Pho & Bun
"the food was very tasty and they offer many gluten free options too. one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been, with very affordable prices. perfect location in the city centre and cosy environment. staff was very friendly and helpful. highly recommended.",5,Pho & Bun
"stick with their pho, the rest wasnt that good. we had the mango salad and calamari, both pretty flavorless.",3,Pho & Bun
lunch here was the best!,5,Pho & Bun
absolutely fantastic food across from queens theatre.,5,Pho & Bun
"the grilled pork vermicelli is highly recommended, tasty and the taste brings you to vietnam immediately. other dishes also taste nicely. well done! reservation is recommended for them to arrange you the seats.",5,Pho & Bun

top notch dim sum.,5,Plum Valley Chinese Restaurant
really great food but a tad expensive. about .5 to 1 pound more per dish compared to the 2 other dim sum restaurants i visited very nearby. but the atmosphere was great with the seating being several floors high and only 6-8 tables per area so it doesn't sound like you're in a crowded protest.,4,Plum Valley Chinese Restaurant

"great service, delicious dim sum!",5,Plum Valley Chinese Restaurant

ok for quick meal desi,2,Rasa Sayang Restaurant
"small, busy and good halal malaysian restaurant. it's not all that cheap but the food is good, and portion size is good too. it is a bit cramped for seating, so privacy can be a bit of a factor if you're with  friends or something. prepare to queue if in a modest group.",4,Rasa Sayang Restaurant

the food in this place is super good!! highly recommend it - very very tasty and great value for money.,5,Rasa Sayang Restaurant

"if you want to try some singaporean/ malaysian dish but want to keep it light and mild, then the hainanese chicken rice is the one. simple yet flavourful.",4,Rasa Sayang Restaurant

it's not that easy to find great malaysian food in london - this is the best i've had here so far.,5,Rasa Sayang Restaurant
wanted to try the laksa but unfortunately it was sold out so we ordered the beef rendang. it was delicious and not too pricey. i miss home!,5,Rasa Sayang Restaurant
really good asian restaurant with a wide array of delicious asian dishes that are freshly cooked and served with the best ingredients and with the help of a very friendly and professional staff as well.,4,Rasa Sayang Restaurant
"food is good. service is good. price is okey to be a bit pricy as it is in china town. the awkward thing is the way they put table for customers. if you order more than 2 dishes, definitely you will be struggling for spacing. and the tables are very closed each other and felt uncomfortable for customers.",4,Rasa Sayang Restaurant
halal malaysian food; tastes really good. would suggest you to make reservations because can be full and no seats. definitely would go there again:),5,Rasa Sayang Restaurant
outstanding service and very tasty food.but i order laksa when food coming is it warm and ingredients was freezing like just take out from fridge.after i request for microwave service.,3,Rasa Sayang Restaurant

"my humble opinion on their malaysia food is just an average. it is not bad but not as delicious as the review by others. in term of their service wise, can be improved better because of their staff comes across less friendly and a bit fierce. to sum up, this restaurant is a bit over-rated.",3,Rasa Sayang Restaurant
"in the heart of chinatown, quite busy from the afternoon right until late night. be prepared to queue. and youll have to wait for your order to come, the service is polite and efficient. the interiors are plain and simple and the food is good, but not great - both in taste and presentation.",4,Rasa Sayang Restaurant
"food quality is outstanding! however, due to lack of staff customer service was lacking. there was more than 20 minutes difference between the serving of each dish ordered and had to remind them too. overall, the restaurant can easily be a 5 star if the customer service improves as the food is always fantastic.",4,Rasa Sayang Restaurant
so delicious! fantastic food that reminded us of our old life in singapore - and such friendly helpful staff. good value too - you must makan here!,5,Rasa Sayang Restaurant

"large servings so although a main dish might be say, around 8 or so, it will fill you up. i love the char kway teow - no clams too. i've always hated clams  bandung is lovely. always a busy place. if you miss singaporean or malaysian food, come here to get your fix.",5,Rasa Sayang Restaurant
"staff were friendly and helpful, but food was over rated. it looked good, but lacks in taste.",2,Rasa Sayang Restaurant
food is very good and authentic.the dowside is that you will probably have to sit too close to strangers. but the price that that you have to pay for good quality food for a very reasonable price.,5,Rasa Sayang Restaurant
unassuming malaysian dishes in a cheap yet cosy setting. the carrot cake stir fry is a must. avoid the satay.,4,Rasa Sayang Restaurant
amazing place. it was muslim friendly and had amazing food. would definitely come here again.,5,Rasa Sayang Restaurant
the food here is authentic and delicious and the portions are generous. service is really efficient and the place has a lively atmosphere with lots of noisy chatter and happy faces. we had to queue on a friday night to get in but they were attentive and got us in quickly. it's cheap too - we were delighted when the bill came!,5,Rasa Sayang Restaurant

"taste authentic, don't have to wait for the food and the dish is enough for two.",5,Rasa Sayang Restaurant

really nice food in here!,5,Rasa Sayang Restaurant
malaysia favourite,4,Rasa Sayang Restaurant
restaurant of a real malaysian-singapourian cuisine. a soup with scallops and noodles was very delicious . for a european it may be a bit too spicy but tastes too good not to try. a dessert with tapioca was nothing special however. among all the restaurants in china town i consider this one as one of the best ones,5,Rasa Sayang Restaurant
their curry laksa is very tasty just a bit too oily...,4,Rasa Sayang Restaurant
this is my first malaysian food so i don't know how authentic they are but the food i  had was very nice and would eat it again. the only complaint i have is that some of the waiters/waitress could be more happy when facing their customers. a little smile would help.,4,Rasa Sayang Restaurant
didn't really liked the ambiance,2,Rasa Sayang Restaurant
"a halal malaysian restaurant in china town. portion is huge, if you are not really hungry consider to share few plates in your group. price is in the mid-range and ask whether the menu is spicy or not if you are not get use to asian spicy food. quite popular amongst malaysian & indonesian residing in london.",4,Rasa Sayang Restaurant

"probably the only halal china town restaurant in london, if you want to treat your friends who are keen on halal food, it is a good place. prices are not low or too high, yet reasonable given the quality and portions.",5,Rasa Sayang Restaurant
they might have changed their cook in 2018. it is not as authentic as in 2017 (speaking from a singapore perspective). not necessarily less tasty though.,4,Rasa Sayang Restaurant

decent bingsoo,4,SHIBUYA SOHO
"i frequent this place for their bingsu. i recommend the matcha flavour but if you're not into that then the mango is superb as well. the rest of the food is average. four stars because the toilet is not very clean and it is very small, hardly any room to move.",4,SHIBUYA SOHO
the best bingsoo i've ever had is from here. highly recommend the kinako flavour! it's just a shame that it's so hard to get a seat here.,5,SHIBUYA SOHO
the bingsu was very nice but the staff are a bit slow in serving and taking orders,4,SHIBUYA SOHO
oh so heavenly milk bingsu! soft as powdered snow and melts on your tongue with a subtle sweetness. delicious! highly recommend the oreo bingsu and the ichigo (strawberry) bingsu. staff are efficient and polite.only thing to note are the long wait times due to small space in the shop. a must visit despite this!,5,SHIBUYA SOHO
best place for shaved ice dessert!!,5,SHIBUYA SOHO

"we went here for dessert, the shave ice was very refreshing, matcha roll cake was really nice too. i took one star off just because the place was a bit small and you might have to wait for a bit if you go with a group larger than 2.",4,SHIBUYA SOHO
"very good food, nice atmospher, food can sometimes take longer than expected to arrive",4,SHIBUYA SOHO
it's absolutely a pathetic restaurant because the staff are flippin korean instead of japanese and the restaurant should be worked by people from their country's tradition.,1,SHIBUYA SOHO
"beautiful small restaurant, we ordered the classic red bean bingsu(classic one) and the mango bingsu. it was absolutely refreshing and was beautiful. this was the first time trying bingsu and i was not disappointed! it was so lovely and will be coming back soon, great customer service!",5,SHIBUYA SOHO

"had a small shaved ice. i really love how fine the ice is and the kinako powder goes perfectly with it. even a small one was too much for me near the end, so perhaps sharing it between 2 would be alright.",4,SHIBUYA SOHO

love those snowy ice desserts.,4,SHIBUYA SOHO
the desserts they serve are something i would come back for. unfortunately my most recent visits have been less impressive than my first one. the attention to service provided has been appalling especially since there was only one other table when my group of friends came.,4,SHIBUYA SOHO
delicious and authentic japanese. save room for their desserts - i would recommend the kinako bing. the small is massive and can serve 2-3 after dinner. can get busy with a long line on friday evenings and weekends ,4,SHIBUYA SOHO

"amazing place, everything is really fresh, tasty and really affordable",5,SHIBUYA SOHO
manga shaved ice is so refreshing i felt born again,5,SHIBUYA SOHO

"mostly dwelled by locals, this japanese casual diner and dessert place specialized in kakigori also offers a small selection of typical japanese caf dishes (tonkotsu, curry, noodles) and a few sushi and donburi options. the overall quality is good and the staff is friendly and polite. very good value for central london as well",5,SHIBUYA SOHO
berry good shaved ice thingies,5,SHIBUYA SOHO
loveable but very tiny japanese place. food is great. definitely try shaved ice if you have never had it.,5,SHIBUYA SOHO

"love the strawberry, matcha and red bean bingsoo!",5,SHIBUYA SOHO
"cute as hell fluffy fat pancakes. not super sweet so didn't feel too naughty. not a big seating area, more like a bench so don't expect to spend too much time here. the fruit teas were also super interesting with loads of fruit and coconut jelly in. worth stopping by!",5,SHIBUYA SOHO
nice and cosy place. food was good too. not ideal if you're claustrophobic.,4,SHIBUYA SOHO

"food no good, i shaving yes!",5,SHIBUYA SOHO
food was good. only problem it took ages to arrive to the table. there was only one person in the kitchen on a saturday at lunch time and we were desperate waiting about an hour (if not longer for the food).,4,SHIBUYA SOHO

i always bring my family here for their tasty shaved ice dessert. this is our go to whenever we have dinner in chinatown. i always recommend them to my friends.,5,SHIBUYA SOHO
was seated in the back which isnt the nicest area. sushi was alright.,3,SHIBUYA SOHO
"price is a little too high for me. food was great though. the hotate is *out of this world* and the shaved ice was surprisingly really good! very smooth, creamy and melty shaved ice.",4,SHIBUYA SOHO
very tasty ,5,SHIBUYA SOHO
super tasty shaved ice i love the matcha flavor one definitely come back ! small size is quite a lot for one person .,5,SHIBUYA SOHO
amazing japanese food and ~,5,SHIBUYA SOHO
the bingsoo is so good here!,5,SHIBUYA SOHO

very pricey yet very yummy. ,4,SHIBUYA SOHO
"this place is expensive af (i mean unagi for 35!!) but the food is good. the best part is the kakigori, if you dont have anything else, you need to try the kakigori ",5,SHIBUYA SOHO
"excellent japanese food in soho, one of many great japanese restaurants around soho, leicester square and shaftesbury avenue popular with students and theatre goers",5,SHIBUYA SOHO
"really nice milk ice-cream, the best i have had so far. there is a slight waiting time but the staff are very polite and there is a great atmosphere.",5,SHIBUYA SOHO
they do not providing authentic japanese cuisine i think. just a restaurant in jp style. and it is run by korean.my friend's beef don was very sweet in taste and my udon was too soft.,1,SHIBUYA SOHO
"my first time here, every single dish was amazing. will definitely go again",5,SHIBUYA SOHO
lovely food and bingsu ,5,SHIBUYA SOHO
amazing and big sized portions. worth to go,5,SHIBUYA SOHO
love the deserts there! the portions can be quite large when it comes to shaved ice cream. worth every penny.,5,SHIBUYA SOHO

try the bing su! pricey but fantastic and very cute atmosphere,5,SHIBUYA SOHO
it was my time having japanese dessert and it was amazing. i had  the oreo choco bing su. i was pleasantly surprised by the shaved ice with sweetened milk. we also true the matcha set and the red bean bingsu. all very impressive. they need to make their seating area more attractive though.,5,SHIBUYA SOHO
"amazing food, great taste and great quality, great service and great massive bills. all round a brilliant experience in a tiny little gem of a restaurant.",5,SHIBUYA SOHO
"a very well put together restaurant with great quality food and good service. the general atmosphere is relaxed and the food is reasonably priced. one improvement would be to have a wider selection of dishes to choose from, other than that the place is perfect for a lunch or dinner, alone or with company.",4,SHIBUYA SOHO
"narrowed supermarket selling chinese food and ingredients. sauce, instant noodle and preserves are in fairly good price but the frozen food does not. always a long queue.",1,SeeWoo
"yes see woo! this place is great! the produce here is so fresh and the variety of products (they even sell cute china!) is impressive. i keep hoping i will run into fuschia dunlop here so cross your fingers for me. buy your wok here, and all the bok choy and chili bean paste to cook in it.",5,SeeWoo
"a typical chinese supermarket in china town-a rich selection of chinese goods and not that good service. however, it should belong to the bests among its peers.",4,SeeWoo
the best chinese supermarket in london. great selection,5,SeeWoo
whole sale vegetables and food ingredients have been sale here. do not come alone. it is much cheaper to share with your friends.,5,SeeWoo
my family were go shopping for the chinese  supermarket while they were shopping for the food,5,SeeWoo
"excellent chinese supermarket the heart of chinatown. they sell kitchen supplies downstairs too. by the way, it's the cheapest place to find a steel wok. ",5,SeeWoo
awsome experience. many rare vegitables and chinese made products,5,SeeWoo
"packed with a fantastic array of good chinese household food brands and some homeware items. perfect for stocking up on hotpots, teas, sweets and frozen meats. has narrow aisles and can get very busy. try to visit during less busy hours using the google busy chart in google maps. ",4,SeeWoo
great selection of chinese fare.  clean store.  very popular with tourists and locals.,4,SeeWoo
"great place for asian groceries...  shame you have to spend more than 10 if you're paying by car (although,  they have a little hide corner at the end of the shop with the cheapest oysters i've ever found in london,  0,70 each)",4,SeeWoo
note : no card payment under 10. decent supermarket so long as you know exactly what you are buying and where to find it. asking for help when in a rush was hopeless :),3,SeeWoo
"often very crowded, this supermarket in the heart of london's chinatown stocks many different chinese and asian grocery products. if you are interested in oriental cooking, this is definitely a place you want to visit.",4,SeeWoo
better stocked and cleaner than other supermarkets in chinatown. quality products at decent prices. ,5,SeeWoo
loads of chinese products at reasonable prices,4,SeeWoo
"gtrat place to get your asian groceries, lots of variety in your typical asian supermarket fashion. staff aren't that friendly, and prices are london prices, but compared to waitrose, sainbury it's much better value for your asian foods. just a pity it's far away so i can only go once / week.",4,SeeWoo
"great range of asian food products on offer. note, cash only for purchases 10 or under.",5,SeeWoo
very good selection of chinese stuff n they are slightly cheaper than other supermarket ,5,SeeWoo
great prices and have a ton of products and brand names - easily one of the best chinese supermarkets in central london. look out for the fresh fruit!,5,SeeWoo
great little store with all the supplies you could want.  the frozen seafood is amazing value.  always busy. ,5,SeeWoo
usually has everything i want. could be easier to move around inside,4,SeeWoo
"good place for oriental food, some things are cheaper then wingyip",4,SeeWoo
many chinese food,4,SeeWoo
happy to shop there.,4,SeeWoo
surprisingly comprehensive asian shop. broad range of frozen dumplings and seafood.,5,SeeWoo
not the biggest oriental shops around but they have the best selection in my opinion,5,SeeWoo
"variety of food, some fresh vegetables, yet rude staff, no matter how good the food is, never going to buy from there again. they are big supplier and big business anyway. they don't care.",2,SeeWoo
"of all the supermarkets in chinatown, it's the best for frozen meats and vegetables. their frozen dumplings also tend to be the cheapest and most flavourful. canned goods however tend largely to have dents in them, so choose carefully. deliveries come in at all hours of the day, so try not to linger by the doors just in case. ",3,SeeWoo
good place for chinese shopping.,4,SeeWoo
clean and tidy environment. cashiers are not friendly though.,4,SeeWoo
i love it. they sell beautiful cups and everything i'm gonna go there again. is a fantastic shop,5,SeeWoo
"it's a good place to get specialist oriental ingredients and utensils. the new seafood extension is good - even if it did mean the loss of mr kong, which was the best restaurant in chinatown",3,SeeWoo
always packed on weekends but it's understandable because restaurants and takeaways need to buy stock but combined with family doing their weekly shop its packed like hell. so avoid if you can on those days. all in all it has all the stuff you need from an asian supermarket without having to go to chinatown. ,3,SeeWoo
its ok,3,SeeWoo
"great selection of chinese food crammed in this shop. you will certainly find what you are looking for but you will continuously find that you are in the way.if you are in china town, well worth the visit, even if you are not there to buy anything.",4,SeeWoo
"got good selection of asian food, home stuff, fishmonger and butcher's. i think this is by far the best chinese supermarket in chinatown. always crowded with long queues though.",5,SeeWoo
"fresh,chilled&frozen asian supermarket.",5,SeeWoo
good asian supermarket. great selection. staff a bit touch and go but that's china town for you. ,4,SeeWoo
get asian things here,5,SeeWoo
your usual chinese supermarket- lots of stuff packed in one small area. good selection of stuff from asia,4,SeeWoo
"my favourite of the chinese supermarkets in london. usually come here to buy chinese greens, sauces, interesting mock meats, and other odds and ends. aisles are a bit cramped and the staff aren't always the most charismatic but i enjoy my visits here nonetheless.",4,SeeWoo
excellent alternative to its competitors on gerrard st. as the aisles are much wider and it's much less crowded so you don't feel anxious.,5,SeeWoo
"standard chinatown grocery store with pretty much all you need. till system a little slow, which meant queuing in the food isles for around 10 mins. ",3,SeeWoo
good chinese supermarket.,5,SeeWoo
they have some chinese vegs that are rare in england. a great selection of sauces too. ,5,SeeWoo
"friendlier staff compared to the other competing chinese supermarket one street away ;-) and less crowding too, with fresher fresh produce.",4,SeeWoo
"efficient and well stocked supermarket run by chinese people with a great range of vegetables, fruits, cooking sauces, seasoning and frozen food from mainly china/hong kong but also from other parts of asia e.g. thailand. there is also a basement where they sell non-food items e.g. crockery and art & crafts.",4,SeeWoo
very good range of products but always so busy and long queues - quite stressful!,4,SeeWoo
this is without doubt the best asian supermarket in europe.,5,SeeWoo
haven't found a better chinese supermarket in london yet!,5,SeeWoo
great range. especially seafood,5,SeeWoo
"chineese, korean, japanese foods in good price.",4,SeeWoo
"fresh vegetable cheaper thia kau choi (chinese chives ), best frozen fish ball, careful with children very crowded difficult to move in the shop",3,SeeWoo
great range of items and quick service at checkout. ,5,SeeWoo
had everything i was looking for even if not the easiest to navigate.,5,SeeWoo
"absolutely rubbish, rude staff! awful food",1,SeeWoo
good quality chinese supermarket with some other kitchen utensils for sale.,4,SeeWoo
excellent food store. good prices. ,5,SeeWoo
very well stocked,5,SeeWoo
one of the better organised groceries in china town. some items on the butcher's counter were alarmingly low-priced...,4,SeeWoo
expect a few of the typical chinatown clichs such as brusque service but see woo is still one of the best places to get oriental foods and ingredients. in recent years has expanded out of the original chinese goods to cover most areas of the far east too,4,SeeWoo
" good range,  decent prices.  shop floor staff appear to consist of manual labourers and couldn't help find items.",4,SeeWoo
this supermarket has recently added some fish tanks for fresh seafoods.,4,SeeWoo
"needed wonton sheets ... and they had them. if you are into cooking oriental foods, this is the place to buy.",4,SeeWoo
quite good chinese supermarket.,3,SeeWoo
go here when i am in the chinatown area to pick up oriental groceries and sauces such as noodles and oyster sauce & chilli oil.  typically rude staff. most of the stuff can be bought in local supermarkets or amazon so the rude staff can be avoided. ,2,SeeWoo
come here for their huge range of chinese meatballs - really the only place i've been able to source proper beef tendon balls in london,5,SeeWoo
"located at the heart of london's chinatown, it is a great place to buy asian groceries and products.",5,SeeWoo

"decent prices, have most stuff, however very cramped",4,SeeWoo
"for such a small chinese supermarket, this place is always incredibly well stocked with lots of diverse offerings.",4,SeeWoo
always found the general chinese & special oriental delicacies needed in see woo. friendly & helpful staff. cashier queue may be long but it is a sign that they are popular with chinese & western customers.,5,SeeWoo
great place for asian stuff!,5,SeeWoo
great location. the price is higher and less food selections then the store in wembley,3,SeeWoo
"very chinese style, staff wasn't helpful at all,but variety choice of korean, japanese and china with private butcher too. price is market price not feel any special. purchase frozen food did not provide double bag, actually, i haven't been offer any bags. chinese supermarket smell full of the environment, feel like return china.",3,SeeWoo
"wide variety of food from asia and also fresh sea food, fish and meat. great selection of frozen dumplings. it's a clean place and price is quite reasonable. i'd say it's the best supermarket in china town. ",5,SeeWoo
one of the best places to buy chinese groceries in london.,5,SeeWoo

good place,5,SeeWoo

great food and fantastic customer service.,5,Shake Shack Leicester Square
looked a quiet busy but the line was fast,4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"there were quite a few people sleeping in the booths and at the tables, no staff we around to help attempt to find a seat for us, we ended up going to five guys down the road, it's a pity as this was my first look at shake shack and i was hugely disappointed.",1,Shake Shack Leicester Square
pricey but damn thats a good burger,4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
very busy but two floors of tables. great shakes,5,Shake Shack Leicester Square
nice hot food serve in big portion in the middle of leicester place.,5,Shake Shack Leicester Square
can't go wrong with shake shack. service was fast and friendly. this location is busy but they pull through. lots of seating area on first and second floor with views of the square.can be a bit pricy and it's often not too filling but the quality is among the best.,5,Shake Shack Leicester Square

"loved the cheesy fries and you can use unidays here to get a free chicken burger, love that",5,Shake Shack Leicester Square
it was very nice meal and deliciousthank you!! from south korea..+ clean toilet,5,Shake Shack Leicester Square
fastish food. overpriced. small portions.  other choices in the area offer better value for money.  better tasting burgers.,3,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"decent but small burger. cheese fries a pathetic excuse for a side. lukewarm with a lump of lukewarm, tasteless sauce on them. had clearly been sitting out waiting for the burger to be ready. not cheap either. better taste, better value in somewhere like byron or five guys",2,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"really expensive,  no shakes (it was about 2 in the morning), and i had to queue for ages up spend my 10.75 for a burger. on the upside,  it came quickly, and it tasted really nice.",3,Shake Shack Leicester Square
good burgers and cool fries! just expensive because of location in my opinion.,4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"queues, confusion. to compact burgers. soggy fries.  sausage was cold but to long queues to complain. broken soap dispenser on toilet with exposed wires.",2,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"food tasted good. that's where the positives end. tables were dirty, ketchup machine was broken and the drinks were flat. it's a fast food set up but without the fast food prices or anything else synonymous with fast.",3,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"staff are so rude and zero knowledge of what gluten free is, plz educate your staff before you kill a customer",1,Shake Shack Leicester Square
it was really the best hamburger i ever eat,5,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"for a place called shake shack, you'd expect a damn good shake and these do not disappoint. at a reasonable price, the team will guide you through the ordering process. our shakes were amazing (not one for slimming world!).cleanliness was not great when we visited though. sticky floors and tables and the toilets really unpleasant.",4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
pretty busy but the food is delicious. wait time is around 15 minutes,4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
small portions but decent burgers. nothing wow about it.,3,Shake Shack Leicester Square
awesome burgers. the veggie one is excellent.,5,Shake Shack Leicester Square

double size concrete was huge! and had a cone on top. amazing value,5,Shake Shack Leicester Square

worst branch which i visited.,1,Shake Shack Leicester Square
godd,4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
first time i had been to a shake shack after being recommend by a friend. the service was great. the burger and shake were great. but the look warm chips really let the meal down.,4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
pour une premire fois agrablement surprise  refaire trs sympa,4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
whats not to like in a place that is open until 3 am... serve u freshly made fries and burgers and always deliver... nothing special just good old junk food for the masses.... the shake shacks in the us serves better meat but its a matter of taste i guess....,4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
compared to the covent garden branch this place is not good. over 15 minutes to get food. fries were cold. by the time the last person of a group of 3 got their food the 1st had finished theirs. seemed to be catering more for deliveries then in house.,2,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"christmas shake was rubbish, the choco-block was bad as well,only reason why i gave 2 stars was because the customer service was good.",2,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"bad bad bad. small portions, expensive, soggy bun, tough bacon, no flavor. cheese fries limp, cheese sauce cheap canned product. not impressed.",1,Shake Shack Leicester Square
very surprised...wonderful chicken sandwich...great spicy treat,4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
i loved their peanut butter milkshake. the rest of the family all loved their different shakes. great service. clean loo and premises.,5,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"simple, tasty and amazing.we order the original with regular fries and the seasonal fries with garlic mayo. after a while the garlic tastes a bit too much, so take this fries only if you are super into garlic. the burger has the perfect size and the whole experience is great.",5,Shake Shack Leicester Square
yum burgers! you've got to eat them with a milkshake ,4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"i've tried the burgers and dogs, they're okay. what annoys me is that on every ocassion they mess up if it's a stay in or take away. i've always had to ask that my order be packed even though the receipt cleary says 'take away'.",4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
it was nice fast service although was very busy perfect for late dinner as not much restaurants opens there in this quality,4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
loooove the burger...tasty,5,Shake Shack Leicester Square
nothing special. expensive fast food but expected because of the location,3,Shake Shack Leicester Square
tasty food long que ..,5,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"service is decent and you are served quickly regardless of it being busy. food tasted good , just need more of a halal menu in this branch like the one in dubai. currently oy the chicken burger is halal. please dont be put off at the size of the burger as they are very filling and worth the money.",4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
very bad quality  for that price,1,Shake Shack Leicester Square
1 of the most friendliest staff i ever seen as late as the time we visited. from the lady who took our order to the floor and tables cleaner.,4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
it was good. staff were friendly but i prefer the one in the usa. it had a better taste to it and the staff were much more friendlier also in stress. i personally wouldnt go back to the one in the uk as its very much a touristic place to eat and the quality isnt 100% the best,3,Shake Shack Leicester Square
overpriced,3,Shake Shack Leicester Square
yum.,4,Shake Shack Leicester Square

best burger around ,5,Shake Shack Leicester Square
an unexpectedly good burger and fries. the portion is big as well. i recommend this place if you fancy a burger.,5,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"very nice food, good service , the employees are polite and well organized...but there was no cleaning papers",4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
food was very good. the queueing system and food collection is organised chaos but the staff can't be blamed for that as it's the customers causing the issues,4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"cold. and really not good.. shake shack used to be my go to, five guys are so much better in the uk.",1,Shake Shack Leicester Square
good place for a quick and delicious burger. my family had a pleasant time,4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"seemed very disorganised, and some of the staff were clearly getting agitated with impatient customers. i don't think an open kitchen is wise given the location of this site is in an extremely busy area, but that's just my opinion. our food was clearly rushed and thrown together haphazardly, and over priced considering the portion sizes.",2,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"the food is really tasty. like the idea of getting the menu on the entrance, however i waited for my food approx. 20mins and laides didn't work so i'm giving it 3 stars...",3,Shake Shack Leicester Square
very busy but as usual better that 5 guys in my opinion,5,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"great food as always, way too busy though.",4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"tasty burger, really nice, right up there with the better burger joints... but just didn't warrant the wait or price, especially given the size of the burger.",4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
i enjoyed shake shack burger and their truffle fries,4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"nice, quite busy though, but that is to be expected based on the location",4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"food very nice, staffs were very friendly, helpful & accommodating...",5,Shake Shack Leicester Square
don't always have everything available but - can't go wrong with shakeshack. gets understandably busy but never had a hellish wait in there.,4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
so busy hardly place to sit.. considering what they are charging i want to eat in peace and enjoy it rather than keep getting looks by other customers who are waiting for people to vacate the seats so they can sit.,3,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"visited the shake shack and i am glad i did, the burger was nice, soft, juicy and tasty it was cooked well. the fries was also nice and crispy with that sauce on top. only problem is they don't have it back home in sydney.",5,Shake Shack Leicester Square
loved cheesy fries. only chicken is halal. good customer service too.,5,Shake Shack Leicester Square
our go to burger bar when in town...well worth the extra few quid.,5,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"the burgers are tasty, but fairly small for the price tbh",4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"great restaurant, very friendly and open staff and, most importantly, really good food.",5,Shake Shack Leicester Square
the quality of the hamburger was far away from the expected. it was clear that the number of people working was lesser than necessary for the area's demand.,1,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"great burgers! super fresh from shake shack. this place is open until 3am, go to after a night out & it's the perfect meal to sober up! just keep in mind it will be busy because of being in central london",4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
i don't know why but i feel that ss at leicester is way superior than the one in covent garden and mansion house. the patty is more crispy and overall the burger feels more fresh.,5,Shake Shack Leicester Square
nice.  a bit busy.  lots of seating space upstairs.   the entrance and the queue is a bit messy.  staff want to serve quickly and not recommend what to eat.   felt rushed.. but food was nice.  not as good as in the past but i prefer the covent garden ... smaller version.,4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"food was ok, nothing special. had to wait an age to get the food. seating area was fine, only one cubicle in the gents bathroom is mind boggling for such a busy area. no toilet paper in the stall either (only realised when needed), pure luck that i'd a few packets of tissue in my day sack.",2,Shake Shack Leicester Square
best burgers hands down,5,Shake Shack Leicester Square
pretty good actually. not expected for a burger restaurant in a touristic area in central london. they serve halal chicken as well and the cheesy fries were awesome. it's much better than any other burger i tried in london,4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"not a very good experience, the burger was pretty small and for the price it isn't a good value. the fries size was okay but those were pretty cold, please make sure you serve warm food! i think for the money you could get better value somewhere else!",2,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"terrible on many levels, food is basic and doesnt stand out from other fast foods, staff was disorganised and it took ages to get our order. i dont understand all the fuss about this place.",1,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"considering it was busy, they managed to organise the queue pretty quick with the buzzers notifications.  food was okay",4,Shake Shack Leicester Square
"strawberry cookies and cream shake was just a lot of whipped cream and a boring liquid strawberry shake. not thick, luscious and rich. bits of cookies were crunchy but could do with bigger chunks.",2,Shake Shack Leicester Square

"if you're really hungry and don't have a lot of time, i guess you can go... too expensive for fast food and the food is really nothing special. they're plenty other fast food places around, some with better shakes, better burgers, and cheeper. i still eat sometimes here..",3,Shake Shack Leicester Square

fine as a bar/pub but had to ask for the bar staff to finish pouring my pint of guiness as he wandered off half way through (i know it is poured in two stages) but started to serve others then went to set tables took almost 10 min to get my pint.,3,Slug & Lettuce Leicester Square
"sticky tables, not to hot on clearing up!",4,Slug & Lettuce Leicester Square

i have had much better burgers. i ordered the southern fried chicken burger which was processed chicken and quite soggy on the inside. the bun was not good quality and was in pieces at the bottom and just a handful of chips.the coco zero was almost flat.not worth the money in my opinion.,1,Slug & Lettuce Leicester Square
not bad value for money for center of london,4,Slug & Lettuce Leicester Square

"ordered the cheese and bacon burger,  with mushrooms.  the mushrooms were covered in black pepper so were inedible so were left on the plate. the bacon was burnt,  the rolls were broken and looked like basic cheap rolls. the burger was was warm not hot.  wouldn't eat here again.",1,Slug & Lettuce Leicester Square
i barman on and left after 15 mins and didnr get served,1,Slug & Lettuce Leicester Square
great for the 241 cocktails! friendly staff too,5,Slug & Lettuce Leicester Square

great place for relieving pain after a long day of walking. the massage is meant to be a little rough but its really effective. people complain about the masseuses talking in chinese all the time but honestly the price and effectiveness of the massage is amazing.,5,Step in Reflexology
"before the massage, my back was uncomfortable, but it was tolerable. during the massage, the pain in the whole shoulder was unbearable. the masseuse told me that my muscles were sticky and she just kneaded them open. results after the massage two days i can not sleep can not stand the pain. the experience was very bad",1,Step in Reflexology
straight (absolutely no frills) reflexology place. i enjoy here but prepare to deal with noisy chatty chinese therapists who will happily chat among themselves.,5,Step in Reflexology
the masseur wore gloves for the 1 hour reflexology session which meant the massage was not very comfortable,2,Step in Reflexology
great to unplug and rewind. i have flat feet i suffer from walking even on even ground. reflexology is good way to relieve pressure to the feet and revitalised. this place is a no fuss professional massage and reflexology shop must visit after long day on your feet.,5,Step in Reflexology
"best value for money massage in central london. experienced staff and great back and feet massages. recently renovated, but still don't expect too much from the surrounds.",5,Step in Reflexology
"probably the worst reflexology i've ever had. they should just call the place a foot rub salon. they had no clue about real relexelogy points and used a stick instead of hand which is thai not chinese, and feels far inferior. the place was etremely unhygenic and staff rude and unfriendly.",1,Step in Reflexology
"without a doubt the very best reflexology in london. friendly team from 25 for 30 mins but i recommend and hour at 45. body massage in safe, trusted environment, both male and female masseurs available. i can't recommend it enough, i've been coming here for 15 years !",5,Step in Reflexology

i love this place. don't go if you want lute music and decorative fountains during your massage. this place is not fancy but the massages are great. ,5,Step in Reflexology
"the foot massage was excellent.  if only the people wouldn't talk so loud.  chairs are to oversized and comfortable.  they do ask you to prepay, which was unusual for someone from the us, but otherwise, very nice and relaxing for the feet.",5,Step in Reflexology
no frills. great price. recommend having one hour.,5,Step in Reflexology
dont get massage from lady very bad dont do feet massage properly. and only talks too much all massage just talking very loudly and very rude. not relaxing at all lady just talk talk talk. dont waste money.,1,Step in Reflexology

"this place is a scam. first, they rip you off by charging 7 pounds a bottle of water and double charged on rice orders without informing the customer, food is mediocre at best (also served cold and at different times). additionally, service was poor with servers refusing or lying about price changes. avoid at all cost.",1,Super Star London

this is the second time we've been in a month and i must say our food selection was so much better this time round. dimsum was great as usual but the scallops with asparagus and seafood udon noodles were amazing. prices were as you would expect in london and service was fast and attentive.,4,Super Star London
same food as a take away but 3x the price. still tasty. wrongly brought out 1/2 duck instead of 1/4 and refused to deduct their mistake from the bill. then asked for tip on the card machine despite already charging 12.5% automatically. the bill isn't itemised so they try and fleece you in any sneaky way they can.,2,Super Star London

we were able to walk in and perch ourselves on the bar for an incredibly delicious supper. everything was cooked to perfection and the produce incredibly fresh and flavorsome. stars of the night was the crispy sea bream (you get a whole fish fyi) and tel aviv mix which were both divine.,5,The Palomar

"casual, easy and great. great atmosphere, great food and great wine. relatively inexpensive compared to some other fancy restaurants in the area. just listen to servers here as they will guide you through ordering perfectly. always need the kubaneh to start and the polenta later in the meal but the chicken livers is not to be missed",5,The Palomar

brilliant brilliant brilliant venue. the food was amazing but the experience of sitting in front of the chef while he did his thing was brilliant. definitely recommend to visit & try everything. its all so good. got a show around the place by the chef which made the whole experience extra special,5,The Palomar
"i sat at the counter, and there's a fantastic energy there. too much of london is merely pleasant and polite---this place was refreshingly fun and alive. food and cocktails were excellent. i especially enjoyed the octopus but was dining solo so didn't get to try too many things. will be back!",5,The Palomar
"had a mid-week lunch here - good sharing plates and options, jerusalem chicken has good flavor to it, but could have been more succulent. other dishes were average.  the bread and dips were fine but nothing to make this restaurant more favorable than other mediterranean ones in london.",4,The Palomar
one of my favorite restaurants ever. there is nothing on their menu that i tried and didn't like. i try to go every time i'm in london. i recently purchased their cookbook (they sell it at the restaurant). i am excited to try some of the recipes. service is fast and friendly. highly recommend.,5,The Palomar
one of my favourite places to eat in london.  you sit at the bar.  cant book so you need to put your name down.  i recommend doing this around 18:00 if youre prepared to eat later.  there are sittings for 18:00 that you can book in advanced if youre happy to eat early.,5,The Palomar
"great staff with a lot of experience and good vibe. the food is tasty, we loved the scallops   and the cobaneh.",5,The Palomar

"probably one of our favourite restaurants in london. the food is very tasty and the environment is quite nice. we absolutely adore the jerusalem mess (pictured). even bought the palomar cookbook, thats how much we love this place. slightly on the pricey side but you wont mind once you taste all that yumminess. recommended!",5,The Palomar
this delightful restaurant gave us an incredible meal. the staff were professional and very knowledgeable about the food they were serving to us. dips were incredible! this really felt like a family-run restaurant taken to the highest level of standard.,5,The Palomar
this place must be one of the best restaurants in london. the food was absolutely delicious. note that the place is usually fully booked. make sure you reserve your table at least a couple of weeks ahead. weve tried most of the dishes from the menu and each was simply wonderful.,5,The Palomar
excellent main dishes. the palenta and chicken livers were a standout. the restaurant provides a very intimate atmosphere in the back or a more active atmosphere at the bar. the appetizers were good and desert was decent. service was also great. highly recommended.,5,The Palomar
"i just have to say the best bread, and hummus i have ever eaten. i still have dreams about it!the mains were not as good as the starters but that just maybe because the food is so so so good!love their drinks too!",5,The Palomar
"lovely food. great service.  busy. recommend seating ""in the back""",5,The Palomar

"great food and service in this trendy and busy place, prices are appropriate for the quality of food and flavor. dishes are made fresh and in front of you if you sit at the bar. you definitely have to reserve!",5,The Palomar

special sea bass was the best fish dish i've ever ate!,5,The Palomar
"excellent food. amazing atmosphere, sitting at the open kitchen bar with view of the kitchen, bar and service areas. service was friendly and efficient. just wish we had more time to enjoy but we had to leave for the opera. only available to book for 1730 otherwise it's first come first served.",5,The Palomar
amazing place,5,The Palomar
"great food, friendly staff and great price-quality! went here for lunch, definitely go for the harissa chicken. the spice merguez is good as well, but like it says it's spicy. ow and the burrata, take that as well!!!",5,The Palomar
incredible food and fantastic staff,5,The Palomar
"really one of my favourite lately. the food is amazing, cocktails are delicious and the service is awesome. what else would you want?great location and super nice place. see you soon!",5,The Palomar

"authentic middle eastern food with a gourmet twist. great friendly service too, sit by the bar for seeing the chefs in action.",5,The Palomar
"unique food. cool vibes. as someone who's familiar with the source (in jerusalem) i have to say that it's a little overrated,  and not as good as the original.still, it's definitely worth the visit.just don't forget to either make a reservation of come early and get a spot at the bar.",4,The Palomar
"very nice place to eat, no complaints at all, will be coming back in the near future.",5,The Palomar

"great middle eastern cuisine, small plates, great vibe. would recommend",5,The Palomar
"just want to say that i love the barbary - the palomar's sister restaurant - which is why i was so so disappointed. it is of course a great looking spot and the service was good but i'll probably never go back. my advice, go to the barbary - cheaper and absolutely a sure thing.",2,The Palomar
super fun place with a very chill vibe. the chef and the staff are hilarious and are gleaming with positive vibe. the food is great although i found a couple dishes a tad bit salty. would most certainly return! i would highly recommend anyone to give this restaurant a shot!,5,The Palomar
"highly recommend this restaurant. had the harissa chicken - tender and delicious. also try the beetroot and goat's cheese, the fatoush and the falafel. lovely flavours and attentive staff. probably the best we had on our london visit.",5,The Palomar
"really different and new food, excellent service, a very special restaurant. don't bother with the menu, instead allow the charming staff a free hand in selecting a (large) choice of starters for you.  be warned that these are sufficiently filling to render a main course almost unnecessary.",5,The Palomar
it is a cool bar/restaurant with a lively bar counter and a separare dessert counterat the front and a seating area at the back. the food is mediterranean and israeli style. there are tapas dishes and also mains. service is friendly and the bartender fixes up a mean cocktail.,4,The Palomar

"food is fine, but not fantastic. service is fairly perfunctory. we were a group of six and got seated in the basement, despite the upstairs area being relatively empty and ended up being on our own there for the entire meal. it had zero ambience - no music and minimal decor.",3,Tokyo Diner

beef soup was mostly water. when i asked for the bill i was told there was a minimum charge of 10 gbp to pay by card. nowhere in the restaurant did it say this. it seems like the kind of place that gets away with low quality (in food and service) because it relies largely on tourists.,1,Viet Food

liked this place alot. only point to make concerns the pho broth. i was hoping it to be more flavorful. other than that it's a great haven for a break accompanied with some nice food in a busy part of the city.,4,Viet Food
"not cheap, but definitely worth every penny. whatever you order, take the signature cocktail with it ;)",4,Viet Food

"great food and service! we ordered the vietnamese pancake, beef pho, and shrimp spring rolls - everything was delicious and fresh.",5,Viet Food
the broth of the pho really tasted of nothing. which is a shame. the calamari was chewy and there were four pieces for five pounds. come on... you must be joking,2,Viet Food
"5 stars to the bar upstairs and the amazing cocktails prepared. the atmosphere is so intimate and cool. the bartenders are really there to listen and to create something amazing, just for you! 4 stars for the food. the curry and soup i had were tasty, but a bit overpriced.",5,Viet Food

beautiful vietnamese food. fresh and delicious.,5,Viet Food
little bit food and less expensive in my opinion,4,Viet Food
food was ok. though dishes are a lot smaller than presented in the menu.seems like the restaurant tries to save on the amount of shrimps/fish/meet being served.the vegetarian soup was great.service is the biggest down side. waiter was so rude and unprofessional.,3,Viet Food
this restaurant serves us a nice vietnamese food with chopsticks which brings nostalgia our east asian culture. one of the best vietnamese food in london we can get. you need to try homemade fried prawn rice.,5,Viet Food
delicious!! we didn't have a reservation but they looked after us with no hesitation. the cocktails are amazing and the food is very tasty. would definitely recommend making a reservation if you're planning to visit. otherwise when we left there was a bit of a queue.,5,Viet Food

i have eaten at this restaurant on and off for 30 years and think it offers very authentic and good quality chinese food at reasonable prices. thoroughly recommend.,5,Wan Chai Corner

"had a really yummy beef ho fun and salt and pepper shrimp. really good simple cantonese food, but fairly expensive considering the dishes weren't huge. 15.80 for the prawns, and 12 for the noodles. still yummy.",4,Wan Chai Corner
pretty authentic cantonese dim sum restaurant.  price is quite reasonable.  a very popular restaurant and most likely you have to wait for a table,5,Wan Chai Corner
great value. good range of options on the menu. delicious food.,5,Wan Chai Corner
used to always come here but today's experience was terrible. i ordered a portion of roast pork to takeaway but there was barely any meat. around 70% of the pieces were all just fat. wasted 11 on just fat. won't be coming back,2,Wan Chai Corner
been going here over 10years now and it's the only place i get dim sum from amazing,5,Wan Chai Corner
a great place for dim sum.,5,Wan Chai Corner
"a disappointing experience.quick service, huge portions but that doesnt make up for the lack of flavors. the spicy aubergine hotpot barely even registered a shiver (in spice as in taste). even the rice was not up to the expectations of a chinese restaurant.",3,Wan Chai Corner
late night eatery and good to go get some chinese food after a large night out.  better equality can be had elsewhere but if you want something quick and open all good this is a good choice.  portion sizes are large and is reflected in the proce.  get the rice congee it's big enough to feed three people!,3,Wan Chai Corner
great dim sum at good value. sometimes you have to wait to get a seat but its worth it!,5,Wan Chai Corner

absolutely stunning pub!,5,Waxy O'Connor's

"good selection of beers and helpful, friendly staff in this pub that seems to have been a fixture in the west end for years.  liked the camden pale ale particularly.  it's deceptively large and seems to have lots of rooms and levels, but that might have been the effects of the camden pale ale....",4,Waxy O'Connor's
"waxy o'connor's is a very cool place. this pub is gigantic and kind of a maze. it's a nice place to go, but the heating is on way too high in this pub. the food was pretty tasty although we didn't order too much. i would definitely go back to have a few drinks.",4,Waxy O'Connor's

the old wife cake has mildew on it. similar to when bread goes stale.,1,Wonderful Patisserie
very rude and unhelpful staff. bread doesn't taste fresh and no expiry or best before date. found a piece of scourer in the bread.,1,Wonderful Patisserie
rubbishhow long have you had your cake?the cake is mildewed and soldi don't want to give a star. my comments just make more people see what the store looks like,1,Wonderful Patisserie
it has all the good stuff you'd find in a shop in hong kong,4,Wonderful Patisserie
"bought a black forest cake with strawberry on top. when i got home my excited son took the strawberry only to find out it has molds underneath it. good thing i was it before he ate it, otherwise he could have been sick this christmas. very disappointing as for the price i was expecting they'd sell fresh cakes",1,Wonderful Patisserie
a nice selection but sadly the bakes were poorly executed,2,Wonderful Patisserie
"it's a large chinese cake shop (with  an anglo/french name) and they sell all manner of chinese cakes and pastries. sweet and savoury.the coconut finger thing was nice, as was the sausage bun. they have loads of different varieties and some quite unusual variations. worth a visit.",3,Wonderful Patisserie
the only place in chinatown that sells kiki noodles. breads and cakes selections are really nice. the pineapple cakes are great. i have also bought  from them before and it was moist and the fillings are generous. the staff are all much friendlier than most other places in chinatown. very helpful and not rushing customers.,5,Wonderful Patisserie
addicted to pandan cake! good prices and lots of treats to choose from.,5,Wonderful Patisserie
"their tiger rolls are beautifully made, just a bit pricey",4,Wonderful Patisserie

good selection of foods good price,4,Wonderful Patisserie
the location of the bakery is perfect. hower the quality of the food is not good enough. it's a cheap bakery ,3,Wonderful Patisserie
"surprised by the negative reviews below. i've been to this bakery twice and have been very happy with everything---the green tea cake with red bean is so tasty that it has become my standard breakfast. the young sales person there is very polite, helpful and patient with me when i wanted to exchange the cake for another one.",5,Wonderful Patisserie
"really bad quality cakes, and even worse staff. they are all very rude and very unhelpful. the smallest request, such as a carrier bag, seemed liked an enormous chore and stroppy staff. will never return. avoid at all costs!! the cakes are extremely awful as well!!!!!! avoid",1,Wonderful Patisserie
"awful awful cake....bought a cheesecake this afternoon. i only had a small slice and i was sick pretty much within 10 minutes, vomiting and upset tummy, awful cramp",1,Wonderful Patisserie
"a large variety of chinese baked goods. the quality is good, fresh, and relatively cheap. try out the lotus and green tea buns or their famous moon cakes. ",5,Wonderful Patisserie
"they used to do a larger selection of pastries. the green tea and taro  pastries are nice, as are their char siu baos. this is the only chinese bakery in chinatown that do natas",3,Wonderful Patisserie

excellent cakes,5,Wonderful Patisserie
"my sisters just bought a coffee roll cake for 5 from there. the cake was mouldy. we called and the woman on the phone was rude and said we have to come back to get a refund. coming back would mean 3 bus fare on top of the price of the mouldy cake. never purchasing from them again, avoid at all costs",1,Wonderful Patisserie
tasty chinese patisserie different to european style.,4,Wonderful Patisserie
"lovely food for lovely price. for me,pensioner it's helpful.",5,Wong Kei
"we went there after christmas time, and to be honest we found the staffs attitude are actually ok. i think its a typical eat and go place to have a faster turn over and the price is really cheap and the food is yummy.",4,Wong Kei
one of my favourite restaurants quick no hassle it's like a a take out but you can sit in and eat and enjoy i suggest drink the green tea it's fantastic,4,Wong Kei
the waiters don't take no bs. instead they serve great food at a reasonable price.,5,Wong Kei
absolute best in chinatown in my opinion! truly authentic experience ;),5,Wong Kei
"if you wanted a quick lunch, they might put you with a stranger on a two-people table, which was a bit awkward. luckily i found a seat at the long tables. cash only. delicious, authentic food for a nice price.",4,Wong Kei
they serve the most amazing chinese food in china town/ leicester square. always keep craving for more. reasonable prices and portions are also good. can be very busy during rush hours though,5,Wong Kei
their crispy pork and duc on rice is legendary. stomach filling on a winter's evening in a central london.,4,Wong Kei
"an institution. fantastic food, really bargain prices. been coming here for 30+ years.",5,Wong Kei
"been coming here for 30 years, it's an institution and it never disappoints!",5,Wong Kei
"honestly, amongst the worst service you can expect at a restaurant. its the most consistent thing about the restaurant. the food is cheap but very average and really not worth the poor and very rude service.",2,Wong Kei
"if you have never been to wong kei, you have never been to london china town. reasonable price with free green tea(the other chinese restaurants charge 1.50) crispy belly pork is a must try, the restaurant's nickname is upstair downstair. there is a story about that. you gotta find out yourself",5,Wong Kei
"great portions, cheap, glib service is part of the charm",5,Wong Kei
food was quite nice and service was quick. waiters however were really rude and disrespectful. between 1 & 4 o'clock is when the place has a queue out the door and it's very noisy and crowded,3,Wong Kei
iconic. great food . portion n decent prices. not as rude as before.,5,Wong Kei
"20years i have been coming to wong key and still my favorite chinese.""u here to look or u here to eat?""no point arguing about the sitting arrangements just sit and enjoy the food!",5,Wong Kei
"it's like being on the set of big trouble in little china. the food is fantastic, and very reasonably priced. the staff are hilarious, they stayed in character the whole time",5,Wong Kei
i had a roast duck noodle soup which i really enjoy despite it being more bone than duck. we also felt really squashed as the tables were close together. but other than that i really recommend this place and the staff were nice and food was cheap.,3,Wong Kei
"brusque would be okay if the service was faster. the food was fine but we still managed to spend 30 on a meal for two, i feel that we could have eaten cheaper, better and friendlier elsewhere.",1,Wong Kei
love the place if your hungry and like to eat chinese food then that's the place roast duck and crispy pork are the best dishes. good prices so the people that write bad reviews should not go there book yourself somewhere and pay double the price. for me it's good quality food that's cheap.,5,Wong Kei
"never disappoints this amazing chinese. food is always delicious, reasonably priced and speedy. the only drawback is that it is cash only. don't be put off by the appearance.",5,Wong Kei
"possibly the worst restaurant in london. but, it's renowned for that. treat this more as a museum for terrible customer service and it's actually the best, most authentic attraction in london. much love.",1,Wong Kei
"for singapore fried noodles, sweet and sour chicken - this place hits the spot. it won't hurt the pocket and tastes good! as a rule of thumb: if you see plenty of chinese people eat in a place and ""slapping the food back"", you know it is a winner.it is all about order quick, nyaam your food and kick out!",5,Wong Kei
i love this place. food is full of flavour and excellent value. don't be surprised if you get put on a table with people you don't know.,5,Wong Kei
"fast service without any fuss, the food is great and is in large proportions - i couldn't finish mine & they kindly brought a takeaway box to put it in. although, bear in mind if you're going as 2-3 people, there's a high likelyhood you'll be seated on a table with strangers",5,Wong Kei
"very much improved on previous times. staff polite enough, service quite quick and food reasonable. even toilets clean!",4,Wong Kei
i can't remember ever going to a restaurant where the staff are so rude and the service is non existent. i felt they just wanted to take the money and get rid of us. the food however is value for money,1,Wong Kei
"you've just had a night out in town, you're hungry, you wanna eat now, no nonsense just serve up... well you can share a table and get your food quickly. service? what service? that's why it's not added! notorious for the lack of service but that's the selling point. have to add the food wasn't bad either.",3,Wong Kei
"it's not that pricey. the food is fine. however, the service is not yet on point.",3,Wong Kei
tasty but i expect some veggies._.the sauce tastes like japanese style.meat and rice perfect!,4,Wong Kei
always love the service here it's part of the fun. you gotta be firm with them! the best on chinatown!,5,Wong Kei
"really great food.really fast and efficient serviceunderstaffed so you need to be quick to order.don't eat the red stuff in the middle of the table, it will blow your nose off.really great value.",5,Wong Kei
"i went with a friend to celebrate my birthday. i ordered and l had only taken a few mouthfuls of the starter. i felt hot and uncomfortable .there was no air, l fainted an ambulance was called.the restaurant staff still charged the full price although most of the food hadn't even come to the table !",1,Wong Kei
"cheap food, tasty. be warned the staff are not there to offer you service. theyll dump you on a table, sling some tea at you, take your order and bring you food. no messing about. if you want a decent feed at a good price without pretences then this place is for you. if you want high dining and attentiveness then dont bother.",5,Wong Kei
very good restaurant with cheap food but also delicious. the only issue is you are paired with strangers on a table and obviously you cant talk about private information or they can also be loud and annoying. (a woman was talking about diarrhoea while we were eating so imagine),3,Wong Kei
"the food isn't the greatest but it isn't the greatest anywhere in chinatown. the price is very good though, and it has a system where you can eat on your own without any social stigma or embarrassment, something that is popular, lucrative and famous!",5,Wong Kei
staff no sense of humourfood okdrinks expensive,2,Wong Kei
roast duck noodle soup..favourite soup of all time..been having this soap from day 1 ,5,Wong Kei
ho fun noodle that was served is not freshly cooked,1,Wong Kei
shed any expectations of a fancy restaurant and consider the price you're paying and you'll enjoy it. a fast food experience rather than leisurely dining.,5,Wong Kei
"good food, sopa de pato with wan tan and noodles is delicious!",5,Wong Kei
yes! a whole mushroom,5,Wong Kei
"my favourite central london chinese restaurant since 1996. rude waiters and shared tables are main features of this place, where food is fresh, very good and very cheap. crispy pork rice, singapore fried noodles and all soups are my favourites!",5,Wong Kei

good duck noodle soup. very affordable.,3,Wong Kei
very decent hong kong styled wanton noodles. generous portions of the wanton & siew yoke. the dirw yoke is very tasty. noodles are tasty & springy too. all fresh. extremely good value for money. service only average but that's not importsmt in a place like this where you just come in for a quick bite & leave,3,Wong Kei
"nice place with awesome food. loved the crispy pork, the sweet & sour chicken, wanton noodle soup and their seafood with criapy noodles. the food takes a bit of a while ti arrive, vut it is definitely worth the wait.",4,Wong Kei

"fast cheap delicious food, don't expect warm service",4,Wong Kei
the fried  prawns and rice the best i ever tasted,5,Wong Kei
"the food was very tasty, big portions and great value for money. the down side was that they could really do with cleaning up and refurbing the toilets, as they were not in a good way!!",4,Wong Kei
a huge dining space in chinatown that is popular with orientals and occidentals. you might have to wait a while to be seated but the food is tasty and reasonably priced.,4,Wong Kei
wong kei has been there for 30 plus years. it's as close as you'll get to authentic chinese as you may have once encountered in wan chi. three floors shared tables and load of free china tea. great food great atmosphere and great prices i love it. long may it continue,4,Wong Kei
"great food, amazing value, fast service ... its quite easy to consider their manner as rudeness when really they are super efficient!!!",5,Wong Kei
looking for awful food combined with poor customer service? you have come to the right place. enjoy!,1,Wong Kei
the food is unreal. my first time there tonight won't be my last. can't wait to go back.,5,Wong Kei
"relic of a bygone era in dining which i really hope doesn't get swept away by gentrification. come here for for cheap grub and plentiful portions. don't whinge about the abrupt, brisk service; that's all part of the appeal (as is the comically dated decor).oh and bring cash as they're averse to card payments.",5,Wong Kei
"i've been in london for ten years and wong kei is undoubtedly my favourite restaurant in london! from my university years to being pregnant, anytime wong kei is my top go-to place. i would travel from kent to wong kei just for the three-meat on rice. strongly recommend!!!!!",5,Wong Kei

"average quality and quantity, but at an attractive price point!",3,Wong Kei
"amazing experience. the best thing about this place along with the food is the service. hilariously rude staff. come with a big group to get the best antics. no need to be overly difficult. the magic just happens on it's own. if you don't take it personally, you'll have an absolute laugh.",5,Wong Kei
food good. service is basic and sparse depending which floor you are sat on. decor basic. go there if this does not worry you.,3,Wong Kei
"good value, decent basic food.",4,Wong Kei
"cheap, quick and easy food with a lot of it!! staff are ok, they are starting to make more of an effort, just depends who you get serving you and anyways you're not there for them, it's all about the food! best thing to get is crispy pork belly on cold rice, be prepared for a mountain of meat!

"order, eat, pay, go.no faffing about.you are served with a minute of sitting down so know what you want beforehand as staff coming back to you will not be as pleasant a welcome.and their chilli oil, mmm mmmm. lovely stuff.",5,Wong Kei
wong kei is the goto chinese 'fast food' palace. if your looking to come here you come for your food and you leave. cash only. staff are their to serve and serve only if you have any dietary requirements you might aswell forgot it as it'll be no help but aside it's great if your looking for a nice quick chinese meal,5,Wong Kei
"disgusting food, cold and probably not cooked properly. staff really rude and keeps on talking about customers in an intolerable way. complained to manager but she clearly doesn't care. do not ever eat there, you'll regret it if you do.",1,Wong Kei

excellent cantonese style resturant. good for value.,5,Wong Kei
great value with good portions.,5,Wong Kei
"very tasty menu, great place.",5,Wong Kei
in comparison with competitors prices are too high for the quality of food served. i would in fact expect to pay much less for this mediocre (at best) food. especially considering that service and appearance are lacking too.,2,Wong Kei
nice food but they have the worst service. i am a frequent customer but im going just for the food,1,Wong Kei
"cheap, filling food. shared tables. we were lucky to have our own table. fast service.",3,Wong Kei
really nice cantonese food. beautiful dim sums.,5,Wong Kei
really good food. not long waiting time.,5,Wong Kei
"always great food and cheap, with quick service. as long as you don't expect service with a smile, this is a great place. its cash only, and you don't get a choice in where you sit or who you sit with as they always share tables, but for the price its great food",5,Wong Kei
funny atmosphere ( service) but professional and very good food,4,Wong Kei
"*cash only* ok chinese food for the budget conscious diner. be prepared for rude staff (one of the things the place is known for), and a scruffy interior.",3,Wong Kei

pls do not go! bad services! normal food! and they don't accept small changes! very bad experience ruined my day! i will not recommended anyone go to this restaurant because there are many other restaurants in the same street!,1,Wong Kei
"this place is a experience i was missing out on. i wouldn't say much as i would spoil it for others. although i would add, the culture and  variety within the atmosphere had been lively upon my visit.",5,Wong Kei
delicious food at low prices. really love the wonton noodle soup and beef brisket noodle soup. saw others with some very large rice meals too which i will try next time. great for solo travellers (although you may need to share a table)!,5,Wong Kei
the quality and blandness of the food and cleanliness of the dining area is indicative of the price. on removing my jacketing and realising it would drag on the floor when hung on the back of my chair i opted to wear it and sweat it out. but if you need to fill your belly on a budget and you want your food pronto this place is ideal.,2,Wong Kei
"do not go here for customer service. food excellent, service fast,  good value for the price. be prepared to share a table.",4,Wong Kei
"cheap and good quality - if you know what to order. need to ignore some of the rude, rural chinese who work here though. some of them are genuinely unpleasant, although others are helpful.",4,Wong Kei
"they were quite rude to me and my friends, and they even tried to charge us just for sitting down! absolutely ridiculous",1,Wong Kei
this is my husbands favourite chinese. good food and price. not fancy dining but its always busy. service is quick and efficient. toilets aren't the cleanest but apart from that still the only place in china town that we eat,5,Wong Kei
"this is a restaurant i have been to for many years.the prices are very reasonable, and the food id good.the seating arrangements may not suit all, but overall a very good restaurant at the price.",4,Wong Kei
the place was fantastic food straight away on the go you don't have to wait long house white wine is excellent this is the second time i've been there and i thoroughly enjoyed the food worth going to this place right into chinatown in soho,5,Wong Kei
"a multi-level chinese restaurant in london's chinatown. usually you share one of the numerous round tables with other diners. the food is tasty and the service is speedy, with efficiency taking priority over friendliness. hot and sour soup followed by chicken and black bean sauce is a favourite of ours",5,Wong Kei
"very authentic chinese restaurant that made me feel like i was back in hong kong. comes complete with ok food, rude staff, cramped walkways and table sharing with dirty cutlery.would recommend for anyone who wants the full chinese food experience.",4,Wong Kei
value for money. quick meal.,4,Wong Kei
good and cheap food. terrible customer service.,3,Wong Kei
"faster than fastfood joints, a whole lot better in food quality and equal in price. why elsewhere",5,Wong Kei
the best duck noodle soup in town!,4,Wong Kei
"what can one say? if they are not rude, then they've lost the plot! so, cheap but absolutely exciting food and rude service is a perfect combination to get sober on a friday night! i never get disappointed with wing kei - over the past 30 years! a symbol of great chinese food in soho!",3,Wong Kei
"bad service and attitude, food was average to low quality. we were not allow to order 3 plates of main course when we come in a group of 4, we were forced to order 4 or more main course. what a waste of money.",1,Wong Kei
"famous for customers being told off by the restaurant waiters e.g. for sitting in the wrong place. fast and furious and recommended for quick, inexpensive hong kong food.",3,Wong Kei
the food is always great. but the service is terrible! no chance of getting a tip.,4,Wong Kei
"right, so i had very low expectations of this place based on the reviews here but have to say that i was pleasantly surprised. prices are very reasonable for the location, food is tasty and authentic, portions are fairly good and service nowhere near as bad as i anticipated. make sure to try their aubergine dishes!",4,Wong Kei
"authentic and great taste even comparing to local asian standard! big portion and affordable, value for money serving. friendly staffs who speak various chinese languages. usually full but you can always get a seat soon as people dont stay long in the restaurant since it is crowded and packed.",5,Wong Kei
"it's probably more than 20 years since i was last at wong kei (back when i actually thought it was called  wonkey's ). the food is still fantastic and reasonably priced, but the staff are nowhere near as, er, ""abrupt""  as they used to be. this place is great, and you should go.",5,Wong Kei
"food is good and tend to be oily though. portion is big. service is questionable. worth visiting if you're in london. if you've been to hong kong, then expect them to be loud. nothing fancy. just eat and go.",3,Wong Kei
relatively cheap and the authentic food is  however this place does not accept card- cash only!!!!,4,Wong Kei
"cash only. very cheap prices, big portions and the food tasted okay. food came out really quick so its perfect if youre in a hurry and feel like a cheap eat.",3,Wong Kei
food is great and price. quick turn over.,4,Wong Kei
"this is no posh restaurant but it is one of the greatest i've been too. free tea served soon as you sit down. orders are taken, food arrived within 5 minutes. this place is huge so can imagine how big kitchen is. food taste delicious! soup is amazing. only place i eat when i go china town! go here you will not be disappointed.",5,Wong Kei
"authentic chinese cuisine. the dish i had was scrambled egg, mushroom beef rice. it was very rich. decent flavor.",3,Wong Kei
"i discovered this restaurant 35 years ago. terrible service at the time but so good and reasonable price. just came back, much better service, and still good. if you look for a good canteen, that's the  place !! simple, cheap and good . what else?",4,Wong Kei
the food is tasteless and i wouldn't accept those surroundings if i hadn't been with friends,1,Wong Kei
great cheap food. superfast service. i've been going for 30 years and it never disappoints.,5,Wong Kei
"good food, rude staff with bad manners. i would still go back there to eat.",5,Wong Kei
"the food isn't gonna win a michelin star, and while i find the service endearing others may find it too gruff. but as a solo eater there is nowhere better in the area for getting well priced, very satisfying cantonese food. the noodle soups in particular are an absolute steal",4,Wong Kei
"love the food, nice and quick. still having a debate with the missus about whether the questionable service is actually an act",3,Wong Kei
"used to be charming with the rude staff, i know this is their usp, but staff on phones and chewing gum, leaning over customers to get plates and clearly ignoring some customers trying to get their attention. cheap though...",1,Wong Kei
very cheap. food is filling. i can't use chopsticks.,5,Wong Kei
"we had to share a table. quirky... or just not enough space for everyone, it's that popular. food was ok.",3,Wong Kei
great food but only food,5,Wong Kei
"affordable food, you have to share a table with others which is interesting. the staff are really friendly",4,Wong Kei
"cheap and cheerful stalwart chinese restaurant in china town. still here after many many years. i remember coming here around 35 years ago. seeing chinese people in the restaurant enjoying a meal is a good sign,  that's for sure...",5,Wong Kei
cheapest eat in chinatown but do not expect high quality,3,Wong Kei
cheap and easy but be prepared to be moved tables during your meal. we used to eat here a lot. the food is fine and the menu extensive. you might get put on a large group table anywhere on the three floors. it's an experience and you'l know if you like it or not very quickly!,4,Wong Kei

"the prices have gone up but the service has gone down like, imagine low and then this is beneath it!the food is good though and that what brings me back to this place. the prices have gone up by 2 per dish recently. with this price range, i have more options around this restaurant now. conveniently located and lots of seating.",3,Wong Kei

good food great price,4,Wong Kei
"i would say that the food is not good, even the service is not good, the staff is not smiling and polite at all. this is the most terrible meal i had in london, definitely not a good experience. would not recommend others to visit this restaurant.",1,Wong Kei
horrible place very rude staff roast duck and  char siew served cold  steamed fish we waited 30 minutes and taste awful vegetables too oily and tastes disgusting  price is reasonable for budget conscious but will not recommend this place ,1,Wong Kei

i don't come here for fancy service. i come here for cheap canto food that does it's job of filling me up. the portions are a good size and the menu has a nice range. i've probably eaten at wong kei the most in chinatown as it's just so straight forward and quick to get a table. make sure you bring cash though!,5,Wong Kei
"but just remember staff are a bit rude, but they make up for it with the food!",5,Wong Kei
"great-tasting food at a reasonable price. this chinese restaurant offers an extensive menu and a quirky, no-frills, communal dining experience. located at the edge of london's chinatown and a few minutes from leicester square, this restaurant is a longtime favourite of londoners and regular visitors alike.",5,Wong Kei
"12 noon on a sunday and not too busy. lunch for 2. delicious beef brisket on rice, aubergine in black bean sauce, extra rice, 1 fanta and chinese tea 25",5,Wong Kei
"very good food, fast service, and reasonably priced. make sure that your expectations are set though, before going here. you come here for the food, and the bare minimal level of customer service. oh, and they only accept cash. highly recommended dish: braised beef brisket. absolutely superb.",4,Wong Kei

"favorite restaurant in china town. cheap, quick service, delicious food. been going here since ive been in the womb.",5,Wong Kei

now a china town classic. top tip..more free tea? take lid if the pot. remember cash only,4,Wong Kei
the food was delicious. i would give 5 stars but the customer service was very bad.,4,Wong Kei
"reliable, cheap fare. used to be incredibly rude - which was part of the deal - but for some reason have become strangely polite ",4,Wong Kei
an institution in london.    been going for years.   food is the best chinese in london.   upstairs downstairs!   a really great experience with a group.    fast efficient and not expensive.,5,Wong Kei
"cheapest food in chinatown, greasy not service and dirty. not recommend",1,Wong Kei

"cheap and authentic, rough and ready eating house. staff not as rude as before, but that was part of the character! know what you're in for and this place his the spot.",4,Wong Kei
food is very good but it's like a school canteen inside,4,Wong Kei
"they seem to have been here for years. the seats downstairs and at ground level are very ""school like"". the first floor is a bit smarter. if you want straight forward chinese then this is a place to go. it's not fine dining though. they only take cash so be warned. a meal plus a bottle of wine came in at 90.",3,Wong Kei
"cheap and cheerful , same for me since my first visit at christmas eve 1969! one star less for loss of entertainment value when you routinely got verbally abused... alas, those days are gone.",4,Wong Kei
lovely fish ball noodle soup served within 5 minutes for 5.90 superb. poor decor.,4,Wong Kei
the staff were very rude! and the food was terrible with a few hairs in it. i will never recomend to any one!!,1,Wong Kei

"the food is very nice, but some of the staff are not very friendly",3,Wong Kei
legendary for good value & bad service...,3,Wong Kei
everything i've read about this place is true. they will put you on a sharing table. instant friends. they'll also change table covers while you're eating so be prepared as you may have to lift your bowl and plates as they do this.,5,Wong Kei
very fast and food very good value,5,Wong Kei
cheap and relatively tasty. good for a quick and fast eat but nit much more. greasy and lacking on quality but wont kill you either so decent overall,4,Wong Kei
authentic and fast!!! it was worth a visit!,4,Wong Kei
absolute hidden gem in chinatown. in a area not short of choice but this is one of the best spots to eat. won ton soup is my favourite and the duck pancakes. dont expect fine dining service but expect delicious food and an efficient service.,5,Wong Kei
"certain dish taste good like the roast duck with pancake, certain not...massive price hike trough the years, some ingredients has been westernized after the mighty old manager left...",2,Wong Kei
the food and great and tasty and the tables and plates+utensils are also clean however the service is hilariously funny the waiters dont smile and they look like theyre dead inside . also you cant pay by card either of they would allow that they would definitely get more customers. would still suggest going for a good meal.,3,Wong Kei
still the best value for money and taste in chinatown,5,Wong Kei
excellent. full of character and characters. i have been coming here for nearly 25 years. here's to 25 more.,5,Wong Kei
"absolutely awful.  the place is renowned for being rude to customers, but tonights experience was worse than awful.  the useless waitress didnt even know whether their food had sugar in it. so they kicked us out!  avoid!",1,Wong Kei
cheap and cheerful. good food and excellent service.,5,Wong Kei
we loved our food here! so yummy! we had two children with us. the only thing i'd say is that the don't have highchairs.... but we managed! fast service and helpful staff! would go back.,4,Wong Kei

"very good food, nice tea,  and great service.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"has great sentimental value, would gladly go here again. staff were lovely and food was stellar. will become one of my restaurant staples. the decor was spot on for 1930s taipei.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"i wanted to like this place but the food was appallingly salty - as if the chef added salt thrice. the food was otherwise quite flavourful, albeit small. like what others have said here, the service wasnt great but i dont really mind because i was there for the food, but it was kind of a let down. :(( i wont rush to go back.",2,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
what an extraordinary restaurant. every dish is amazing. seating can be a bit cramped but i am more than happy to put up with that for this food. ,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"i like the interior, the presentation, the service. but the food is hard to say: there is very little that is taiwanese or even chinese about the food. unless you look at the chopsticks and some of the plates. for experimental cuisine, i'd rate it very good but not quite excellent.",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
great food well presented,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
food is intolerable. would never go again.,1,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
delicious and creative with a nostalgic ambiance and '20s music,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant

good food but the quality of service is not good.,4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"started by people behind bao. i was here on the first day they opened. i was here again the first day they started their tea ceremony. i've had many taiwanese meal, nothing came close to xu when it comes to the quality and inventiveness. highly highly recommended!",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"seriously good food, everything is good but l would definitely recommend the eel!",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
great food and a great atmosphere. i'd highly recommend they're specialities very tasty and just the right amount so you don't overheat.,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"not authentic, very small portion sizes, overpriced :(",2,XU Teahouse & Restaurant

expensive not really taiwanese food,3,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
my new favourite in london. excellent starters. love the ambiance. service 6/10,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
silly place. cool decor but the food is so expensive for what it is and is 98% salt. save some money and just pop next to door to chinatown and get better food for a lot less. this place is stuck between hipster-over indulgence and authentic asia. does both pretty poorly.,1,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
art deco interiors and interestingly good food. service should have been much better.,4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"stylish, mannered and welcoming",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
expensive and boring,3,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
delicious. really tasty and innovative taiwanese food.,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
super disappointed. had been wanting to try this for ages. everything was far too salty. only thing i liked were the cocktails. but they were tiny. far too expensive for what was served. i would recommend bao. not xu. parents ended up refusing to eat the food so we went to chinatown afterwards,1,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"fantastic food and venue, only slightly let down by the abrupt and some what unwelcoming service. would have been a 5.",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
very good... definitely coming back.,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"amazing food, friendly staffs, also really lovely decoration that goes really well with the atmosphere of the restaurant aim to bring out.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
incredible food. a bit pricier and more refined than your normal chinatown place but definitely worth it!,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"nice ambiance, quality interior decor. however, the food is overrated.",2,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"concept is cool to modernize traditional taiwanese style dishes and drink like taiwan high mountain tea infused gin to make cocktail.while food is bit too greasy with too strong flavor, the steam rice is too soft and sticky ahrd to taste the txture",3,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"nice restaurant, good service, ok food but quite overpriced",3,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
excellent food and service. well recommended,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"original in many ways, interesting and sufficiently diverse menu, excellent knowledgeable and attentive staff although it takes a long time until food gets served. cocktails and drinks selection ok but not great value for money or otherwise exceptional.",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"lovely ambience, excellent service. we ordered a variety of dishes but the highlights were the chicken main dish, vermicelli side dish, and the cold brew house tea which was exquisite!!",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
cozy space and everything we ordered was delicious!,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"good food, great interior. i love most of the starters and the mapo tofu was simply amazing..",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"taiwanese fusion, but tasted more like chinese fusion. i'd suggest adding more chinese waiters to add to the atmosphere. does seem a bit whitewashed for a taiwanese place. the tomato eel was small in portion with lots of vinegar, and chilli oil. the signature pork is pretty good, as well as the onion rice.",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"really happy with the food here, the ambience is lovely, with a 30s oriental vibe. the lardo lard rice is amazing and a must try, so is the egg drop crab.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"wow!  this place is to die for!  the tea selection, all the dishes and a cool atmosphere",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
very tasteful taiwanese food and friendly staff. cozy atmosphere.,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant

"simply superb high end chinese / taiwanese... adored it, not cheap though...",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
amazing food and great service.,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"really beautiful interior, friendly staff and good food and drink.my only problem was, as another reviewer noted, the vegetarian/vegan options were limited and didnt add up to a feeling of having had a whole meal.",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
fancy taiwanese food i'm not sure if they are original since i never been to taiwan province but the environment was pleasent. and food are ok.,4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
amazing find,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant

surprisingly average. lovely surroundings but have had better for less.,3,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
such a great place. food was amazing - from starters (prawn) to desserts (sponge). definite recommendation.,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
one of the most interesting restaurants i have been to. unique food in a unique environment which you don't often find in london any more,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
nice food but disappointing.,3,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"this is a really original venue and certainly feels unique. a gentle ambiance makes one feels we had stepped into a 1920s chinese tea house. the staff were good at guiding us through the menu. the food was delicate, delicious and well presented. definitely worth it for understated style and food.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"tasty food, nice decor - went twice and there were both super positive experiences.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"popped in for some drinks and dumplings. their taro dumplings (particularly the taiwanese sausage one) are out of this world. the bone marrow pancakes were also great, and the cocktails surprisingly tasty.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"unimpressive, overrated, forgettable and wildly overpriced.",2,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"food was great but the potion was small. a nice interior and the food was presented nicely. the service can be improved : it took about 10-15mins to serve a cocktail (each time, we had to remind the waiter) and one of the waiters was not friendly. i wouldn't rush to go back,..",3,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"one of my favourite places in london right now. great value,  great service. the ma po tofu is a game changer.  also the xu reisling is an excellent wine. the staff are super knowledgeable and will help you through the menu easily. the lunch rice bowls are especially good value and the 39 set menu will leave you stuffed.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
one of the best meals we've had in a long time. the set menu is fantastic value at 40 and offers you a generous selection of food. highly recommended.,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
reserve in advance or try a walk-in. the restaurant is beautiful inside with a luxurious feel. food can be a little spicy so be sure to put forth any concerns to your waiter. lastly dont start your meal without trying the cocktails.,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"foood was great, service was terrible.",2,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
delicious food and lovely service. not the cheapest but not expensive enough to ruin the meal. their recommendations were spot on too. the wine was really good but about 10 pounds too much. that's why i'm not giving it 5 stars.,4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
great staff but food needs a update,2,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
lovely tea based cocktails! there's nowherr else liks this in london,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant

"great decor, the food was good although i felt the sea bass was a little bland. on the whole we felt that the dishes were too small for the price they were. favourite dishes were the crab with deep fried bao, tofu and mushroom rice. for starters i loved the cuttlefish toast.",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"we opted for the pre-theatre menu and were very disappointed in the tiny portions, oily food, and generally obnoxious service...avoid!",1,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
fantastic. delicious. great tea. expensive but worth it. upstairs is more beautiful. service great!,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant

"yummy, original taiwanese food in a lovely setting. i've been here twice and have enjoyed it both times. serving sizes are on the smaller side, but everything is really tasty. decor has a cool 1920s vibe to it, as do the sever uniforms. i'm sure i'll be back again.",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
everything was great except the food.,2,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
lovely looking amd nice staff but pricey and the set meal high tea has too little savoury food and too much desert to be a suitable lunch,4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"wonderful tea room, lovely teas, good for a quiet drink while out in central london",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"intimate and well formed, this place serves up a great tea ceremony with a mix of savory and sweet dim sums. ask your waiter/waitress for tea recommendations.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
i decided to try this place due to really good reviews. the decor was lovely and i really liked the theme of the restaurant. the food was a complete let down. was extremely salty and the portions were tiny. not worth the amount they are charging. i won't be coming back here.,2,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"amazing service, food and drinks! can't recommend enough.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"a very fine dining experience. beautiful decor upstairs; art deco stream train themed. the cocktails were exquisite and the food immense! highly recommend the shou pa chicken, beef shortrib pancakes and the cuttlefish toast, though can imagine everything on the menu is divine.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
timeless atmosphere. it feels like you are in a 1920's train crossing china. staff was very attentive and respectful. the food felt both authentic and high standard and everything was delicious. there are also single tables for solo diners which are very cute.,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"had the traditional tea ceremony. they do it for you the first round of tea and then you get to have a go which is fun. lovely selection of savoury and sweet, which wasnt too sweet. would definitely recommend if you find traditional afternoon tea too much",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
only reason for three stars ... lengthy.. felt like an hour between each course. food was nice.,3,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"amazing food, and very stylish modern decor, staff are wonderful 5 stars!!!!",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
delicious. really recommend this place original combinations.,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"everything here is delicious. come here and eat everything! what they do to scallops here, wow! the onion lard rice changed everything i thought i knew about rice as an accompaniment. this place is pricey but worth it. there isn't a better restaurant experience in london.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
amazing food. some flavours i've never had before. i  can recommend the chicken and crab mains - both delicious. more fine dining than traditional taiwanese. only minor issue was the waiting for a table even though we had booked.,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
brilliant tasting menu,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"good food, service only ok, very tasty but pretty overpriced. good.",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"really weirdly intensely flavoured, tiny baby portion sized versions of chinese classics. defo go if someone else is paying",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"we werent that impressed with the food. our table was hidden away in the mahjong room which we werent too pleased with. very expensive for what it is, and we were definitely expecting more from this place.",3,XU Teahouse & Restaurant

"absolutely delicious. the food was wonderful, the cocktails spot on, and the atmosphere is great - buzzy but not too loud and beautifully designed. somewhat pricey but not unusually so given the quality of everything.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"i have mixed feelings about xu. love the interior design. excellent service. good cocktails. the food was elegant and refined, but it wasn't really taiwanese. maybe ""inspired by taiwanese"" would be more appropriate...",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
hard to believe that kale and tofu can taste so good. the steamed egg with truffle is also sublime. delightful ambience too.,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"visited xu in the afternoon and tried the afternoon menu. very impressed beautiful restaurant, friendly staff and great food especially the suckling pig. the tea was also very special and worth trying. overall i would recommend xu, it is on the more expensive side bet well worth it.",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"good food if a little expensive, but great service and lovely ambiance in the top floor room. we weren't convinced by the glazed sweet and sour aubergine, but all other dishes (the various types of small wraps/dumplings and particularly the pork) were great.",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"- good environment, really nice food!- ideally book online before going",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
london's take on taiwanese food. all the dishes we've tried are rich and flavoursome. they have their tea bar headed by their inhouse expert! the cold brewed tea is really fantastic and a must try.,4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"complete let down, the pork was fatty and extremely salty, the portions tiny and the service slow. the location and interior was great but that is about it.",1,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
refined cuisine with a touch of glamour. decor harkens back to a bygone taiwanese era which i rate highly. teapots and teas were very fussy however and the table we were sat at was almost too small and crowded. would come back to visit the top floor if price was a little bit more reasonable for the portion sizes.,3,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
i had hopes this restaurant would impress. i gave it a second chance but unfortunately the food was the same as the first visit - bland. service was neither warm nor unpleasant. was quite disappointed walking out of there on both occasions.,2,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
very good authentic cuisine,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
brings me back to the memory lane of childhood street food. yum,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
classy and tasty but a little overpriced,3,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
amazing char siu pork and decadent interior reminiscent of colonial era taipei. interesting tea selection coming from medicine drawer counters,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
the decor is breathtaking and the food is some really interesting adaptions on some classic chinese dishes. they are delicious,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
food was very good but the portions were tiny and the service needs some improvement. also we were overcharged on the bill for an item we didnt order.,3,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
good food. different dishes and tastes.. but felt a little too pricey,4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
we had an excellent dinner at xu. every plate was beautifully presented and came with an explosion of well balanced flavours. friendly but especially genuine service.we will definitely be back!,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant

great place. felt very cool and classy.,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
nice taiwanese fusion restaurant with a good decor. entree and small dishes are good but very small for the value. the main dishes are good in flavour and presentation but also probably not good food for value. however would be a good place to try.,3,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"great food, - garlic steamed cockles to die for!!! very good service (with the exception of the main host) but very small tables and uncomfortable seating.",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
i literally had to puke after having dinner. me and my wife went there and ordered the fixed menu. everything was fried and truly disgusting,1,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
delicious and inventive taiwanese cuisine. yummy small plates and great cocktails. love the idea of whiskey and tea pairings! they recently started serving the tea time menu and it's absolutely superb - lots of small plates/dishes to try. the mini tea ceremony is also really fun. highly recommend the tea!,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"service was good, could be improved, however food was on point! my favourite is the chilli egg drop crab!",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"amazing food and excellent, cozy environment!",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"delicious food in a very nice setting. the restaurant has good service and has comfy booth seats. upstairs has a nicer ambience, so ask for a table upstairs. the starters were very tasty and the main just the right size. overall great food that is different from the usual, and every dish has it's own distinct flavour.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
this is so good. i recommend the chicken house special and the taro dim sum. also the tea tasing menu was lovely,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"fantastic restaurant, small tapas-like dishes with new and exciting flavours, good selection of drinks and wines. helpful and friendly staff. this is certainly a must-visit if you find yourself in the area.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"it's a good place for people who prefer flavour over taste of ingredient. they cook meat in a distinctive way, juicy and tender. overall think it's overpriced for the portion of food.",3,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
some of the dishes contains flavours that are surprisingly true to taiwanese flavour. but some of the fusion dishes can taste weird.,4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
amazing experience. great pre theater menu with a twist.,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"great decour, innovative and interesting food.",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"food is excellent - dishes prepared with great care, are unique and delicious. interior is very well done - like stepping into a taiwanese tea house. service although friendly was disorganised and slow. if they can sort this out i would love to go back.",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
this place is absolutely beautiful. tea and food delicious. well worth the visit.,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
so unusual and so good. this restaurant has such a comforting lush oriental class. you feel like you've been transported across the globe to another country and i guess that's the idea. food and drinks were both superb. staff could be friendlier and some of them would be more suited working in a gp surgery.,4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"great place, very professional and friendly staff who made our experience feel extra special. food was so tasty and interesting. thanks again.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"fantastic, authentic taiwanese food. the set menu is a good offer, highly recommend the chickens and crab mains.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
it's all about the ambiance i am afraid. the restaurant space is pretty small. the food is way too greasy than it should be and i dont quite agree that these are typical taiwanese food. most of the dishes have confusing names and are not taiwanese recopies.,2,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
great interior design. excellent food. you feel as if youve time travelled to taiwan in 30s.,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"good place, nice modern take on taiwanese food but found everything a bit salty. authentic flavours and good service",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"almost all of the dishes that came out were exceptional, the mocktails too.",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
highly recommend the shoupa chicken and the caviar toast. the  lord rice was so authentic that take me back home from the first taste. didnt find the dumpling or xianbing too attractive though.,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
the dumplings were fantastic - great variety of choice and the teas were very good. love the atmosphere - reminds me of old hong kong style,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
went there a while ago but loved everything!!! really nice take on taiwanese cuisine and super happy to have a nice taiwanese restaurant in london. will definitely return whenever i miss home. booking highly recommend.,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"very very tasty and special chinese dishes. only downside was that after being at the gym before coming, i left a bit hungry... we had the tasting menu which was excellent.",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"had a really nice afternoon tea here! love the tea and the sweets, especially the pineapple cakes, but the savouries can be improved (lack a little in its flavour). overall a very unique experience, with great service and not too pricey.",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
good food and nice atmosphere,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
consistently amazing food and service!,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"nice atmosphere and service, but not the place for authentic taiwanese food. dumplings and sticky rice were tasty and hot, but the rest of the food arrived cold.",2,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
so crowded. the restaurant crammed way too many people into such a small place. the food is okay but does not justify the high price.,3,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"fantastic place with great flavours and gentle ambience. ordered the crab (singapore style), cuttle fish toast, chicken char sui and pork puffs. everything was amazing with each dish better than the last.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"the flavours of taiwan, from teas to full meals, served in a wood panelled take on 1930s taipei.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"had never tried taiwanese food before coming here, i'm very glad i came, you're doing your culture proud by serving food that good. very impressed overall. good service, friendly staff and a warm and welcoming atmosphere.",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
the chat sui is a must try!,4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"great decor, amazing taiwanese food, and tea.on a pricey side. an evening for two with no alcohol for almost 100. you can get a 3-course menu in a michelin star place for that. i'd recommend revising the prices.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"excellent. good service, creative delicious food and wonderful teas and drinks.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"very innovative and tasty food and good service. set lunch is very good value. the restaurant is small so i would advise to book. we did not and ended up at a table by the door, which is somewhat exposed to the elements every time the door opens.",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"very nice place, good service and great food. try the smoked tea duck, best thing ever!",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"excellent service, a staff very friendly, the food was really good!",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
very bad food and service. i had a stomach ache after i ate there.,1,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
really nice looking place and good service but hugely overpriced. tiny portions that did not taste great.,2,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"the service in this place is incredible. super friendly staff, very attentive, and very helpful when describing the menu. if you go here, get the iberico pork for main course! it is incredible!",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
amazing food great atmosphere,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"while rather pricey, this traditional tea house offers a unique experience. the food is delicious, skillfully prepared, and well presented. the service is also excellent. overall very satisfied with the experience. would definitely meet here with friends from london or visiting next time i get a chance.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
fabulous place with great food! the waiter was extremely good and took his time to explain the food and wine. top notch!,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"wonderful experience! delicious food, great recommendations from the stuff, amazing decoration and atmosphere. we had a lovely evening here! try their cocktails, unusual and full of flavour.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"a very pretentious restaurant one should avoid unless you want to feel unsatisfied and unhappy at the end of the meal. yep, this place do that to you. neither chinese nor taiwanese, not for people who have real class tastebuds. their xian bing is so awful, and wasn't cooked through properly...",1,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
great food. pricey with small portions though.,4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"attentive service. delectable cocktails. engaging atmosphere. sumptuous presentation. but most importantly... top class taiwanese food, vivid flavours that are beautifully presentedl, perfectly timed, and gleefully unafraid to serve signature dishes laced liberally with chicken and pork fat.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"a fascinating place to eat! with it's old colonial style decor and brilliant service xu offers great food which will keep you coming back for more. we had the pre-theatre veggie set menu and it was morish, speedy and very tasty. their tea and drink selection was great and i would recommend to anyone in the area.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
wow. what a pleasure. definitely the place to go for a nice lunch or dinner. makes you feel like you in a french little city restaurant with authentic well delivered taiwanese cuisine. definitely on my list of favorite restaurants.,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
the food is ok. but very very slow. also very expensive compare to the quality and quantity.,1,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
every single dish we tried was very good and special. the cocktails were also divine. i also loved the classy decor reminiscent of the 1920s. the staff was polite and attentive. i would highly recommend!,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"probably one of the best taiwanese in london, gin made drinks are very good too",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
steamed egg was not hot enough but tasted good. lard rice is good but too much juice to make it too greasy. others are not bad! the environment is great and comfortable. im  a taiwanese. the char siu pork is a little bit salty and fatty!,3,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"good atmosphere. good sound insulation good toilet good service. but the food was not good. especially at the price point with small portions, not at all recommendable. with all the nearby options, not a place to go to enjoy food.",2,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"vegetarian options are quite average to be honest. a forgettable meal. they also forgot that it was my partners birthday. service could be improved in terms of attentiveness. the decor, branding and overall vibe is very cool.",3,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"the atmosphere is 5 star. however as taiwanese food, its toooooo modern and loses the original flavor. not a good choice if you really want to try taiwanese style:/",2,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"great food. there were three of us and we ate the try menu. the food exquisite and the red wine was especially good from the drink menu. we will come back. nice atmosphere, cozy and good customer services",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"best food, super nice staff, constantly fantastic atmosphere. they charge reasonable pricing and the food quality is awesome. keep up the good work.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
very nice food and great staff. our server simona was amazing!! we had a great start of the new year!!,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
the atmosphere in this place is unique! the furniture and the ilumination it makes you feel like you're in asia. i went for a ceremony tea ( pictures below) and i could taste two different top quality teas combined with two rounds of excellence delicatessens ( savoury and sweet). i totally recommend the whole experience!,4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
very special i think. the decor is very romantic and the food amazing. lovely place.,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"if two people order two set menus, it would be better if the food comes in separate plates, not in one plate. the servers touched the bowl when serving, and it was not hygiene. pricey.   mapo tofu was not original at all.",3,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"great selection of interesting dishes, modern take on classical taiwanese. the interior is also very enjoyable.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
excellent food and the tea is amazing. would definitely go again.,4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
possibly my favourite chinese restaurant in london at the moment  the sweet potato dumplings are ,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"i would say its not authentic taiwanese cuisine, more like fusion chinese food. for my experience, compare to the taste of food, its a bit pricey, you pay for the interior decoration and the atmosphere. and for most dishes we ordered, its either too dry (eg. the duck) or too creamy/ greasy (eg. the crab).",3,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"nice restaurant, excellent service, delicious exotic food. if you want to discover something new try it!!",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"very neat little place,quirky design.worth a visit.",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"excellent restaurant with a unique twist on taiwanese food. there is a welcome focus on ceremony without seeming overly demanding to visitors. the food is wonderful, the cod roe sandwiches, chili crab in egg drop and fried pigs tails were memorable.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"nice atmosphere. creative, contemporary and not didascalic interpretation of taiwanese cuisine. very good dumplings, tea and cocktails.",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
lovely interior. staff were amazing. food delicious however would not recommend set menus. portions are incredibly small.,5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
tapas style asian food v tasty tasting menu is a bit pricy but with it,4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
we had the a la carte menu with the wine pairing and it was good. i wouldn't say it was exceptional but the staff kind and attentive.,3,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"food look good but way too pricey for what you get. being born and bred in taiwan, these are not authentic taiwanese food. the service was awful, we waited for 15 mins to get our food menu and waited for more than 40 mins between our starters and main dishes. overall too overpriced.",1,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"a bit pricey but the ambiance is really good, so ideal for a date or special occasion.",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
no bad comment on the taste of food. the two stars is all because the service and partially the price. servers are not welcoming and no patient for any question. we got steam rice served at the very end of the meal when theres only 1 dish left to eat with white rice.,2,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"love the ambiance here. portions are on the smaller side but the food is always great and delicately made, one of my favourite places in london",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
good restaurant. the pork is amazing. very nice interior and good drinks,4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"had a really good time here - lovely food (especially the dumplings) and a chilled out and relaxed atmosphere. nicely decorated, and a great place to come for a celebration or romantic meal. good service",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"an excellent representation of a taiwanese tea house. the interior is mahogany dark. you are transposed to 50s taiwan a remarkable transformation and the food is exquisite. perfectly balanced. we experienced the hospitality of a tattooed german gent. and the food well, check the pictures.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"decor to die for and the friendliest service youll ever experience. the food is authentic, tasty and (for the location) reasonably priced. can recommend the tasting menu, especially if youre unfamiliar with taiwanese cuisine (and lets be honest, apart from the taiwanese, who is?)",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"interesting food, and i like my steak. but the portion is quite small.",4,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"xu is genuinely a different experience from the usual chinese restaurant experience and the place really does feel like you are in 1930s taiwan. the egg drop crab is amazing and the shou pa chicken too. i will definitely be going back ....not the cheapest, but excellence is not cheap.",5,XU Teahouse & Restaurant
"best bubble tea of all time! i always queue for the mudflip special, but defoo worth it guys!!!",5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
"serves its purpose.very, very ascetic.fresh taste.",5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
a little surprise on the bottom,5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
love the mudflip (aka brown sugar pearl milk tea) but the wait can be long and they only have it at two time slots during the day until sold out. their fruit tea is refreshing,5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
delicious tea - best bubble tea ive had. i would recommend milk tea with slight sugar and bubbles!,5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
"delicious milk tea and pearls. quick service, yet to try their famous mudflip milktea which is sold in limited in quantity.",5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
refreshing fruit tea. cant believe i try this in london instead of hong kong!,5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
the mudslide ,5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
drinks here are good but really annoyed with the one drink per person policy for the brown sugar pearl milk tea. so if i'm buying more than one of these drinks for my family/friends i need to keep coming back in a disguise... why the 'exclusivity'??? it's unnecessary.,1,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
"excellent tea shop in london, be fond of their fruit tea. all natural taste can be rich in the mouth",5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
they produce a cone with lots of bubbles (should have taken a photo of it).,4,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
terrible brand....never buy it again,1,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
excelllent ambience and great food,5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
"love how there is fresh fruit in my pineapple green tea! ive been waiting to try yi fang but wanted to avoid the long queues. the tapioca pearls are on the smaller side and arent very chewy (just soft) but apart from that, the drink was refreshing. i can imagine itd be even better on a hot day. adjustable sugar/ice levels available.",4,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
this small outfit was at a recent food festival in london they have a great team and serve proper thirst quenching teas,5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
always park on the yellow line and block traffic,1,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
best bubble tea around!,5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
we had to wait 25 min after ordering and paying for the drinks. then we were told the pearls were told out but they would be happy to refund us. a waste of time. you couldve mentioned that when we were ordering.,1,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
best ever !!! loved it,5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
"i highly enjoy the tea here only issue is that teas do sell out quickly, its not worth going in the evening as none of my favourite flavours will be available",5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
"bought bubble tea once. from the liquid it seems they put less milk than other bubble tea sellers. it tastes not rich, more like a mixture of sugar and water. overrated.",3,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
have applied many times but they never respond after viewing my cv. guess prejudiced in appointing staff only from china,2,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
basic,3,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
such great drinks - amazing.,5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
super delicious milk teas ;),5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
the best tea i've ever had! also great customer service.,5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown

"what a drink! i never had that kind of tea drink, bad azz!",4,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
nice but still prefer the original stores in taiwan though:),4,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
"their fruit teas are great, tried sugar cane and felt disappointed, just tasted like water with sugar. the queues are really long, we walked past a few times but it was just getting longer. and they dont have many menus, you have so many people standing there obviously youd need more? and the worker was very confusing too.",3,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
"went on 27/08, the cashier was without any smile and didnt give me the points card.",4,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
this is a authentic franchise tea shop from taiwan and the taste is exactly the same as it would be in taiwan. both of my friends loved what they ordered. and i had a fruit tea which makes you feel so  happy.,5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
"great fruit and milk tea! the long queues are for the mudflip tea, which they only serve twice a day. i tried it in hk and its really good, but ive yet to try it here. the fruit teas are really nice though with a generous serving of fresh fruit! ",5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
"the taste is just normal, the staff is not friendly. and milk tea is quite no taste even i ordered normal sugar",3,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
good fruit tea.,4,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
"very nice place, i ordered fresh milk tea and yi fang fruit tea and both of them were amazing!!!",5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown

fantastic food,5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
the worst bubble tea i have ever had,1,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
"limited menu available however, they offer unique flavours. the yakult milk iced tea is strange as it has a slight sour taste. but overall it is quite pleasant. the store usually has very very long queues so beware. furthermore, my server lacked good english proficiency so it was slightly difficult to communicate.",3,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
hyped but the hype was worth it,5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
super authentic,5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
expensive,2,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
104 shaftesbury ave,5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
amazing taste! but quite pricy for bubble tea i would say. the price has gone up quite a bit since they first opened.,5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
"i like the fact that they have more of the authentic flavours. wait times can be long though, as they're always busy",3,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
"this yifang doesnt have the hot option unlike their spitalfields one, here they only have warm which cooled down much too quickly.also the pearls were clumped together into a  mass.",3,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
"absolutely love their milk teas. also, very convenient to have them at bond street station. staff is very friendly! :) highly recommend!",5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
a no bs hole in the wall store - which is great. ordered very quickly and the milk tea was delicious.,4,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
come here for authentic milk and fruit teas.their signatures are the best - milk tea with pearls and fruit teas are all winners. love that the teas are sourced and all the recipes of milk/fruit teas have their unique flavours. never been disappointed with the quality. definitely recommend!,5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown
"this location  makes better drinks than the other one which is like 5 mins walk away, the other shop constantly gets the sugar level wrong...",4,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown

"pandan ice cream, need i say more ",5,Yolkin
smooth and creamy ice cream.  durian is very good!,4,Yolkin
"delicious, rich beautiful ice cream. friendly staff, with reasonable prices.",5,Yolkin
the rose and lychee macaron ice cream is the best dessert ive ever had but be sure to check they have it as the menu options vary each day based on season.,5,Yolkin
horlicks & pandan coconut flavor ,5,Yolkin
amazing selection of home made 'south east asian' flavoured ice creams. corn / durian / pandan / milo / vietnamese coffee / etc. highly recommended ! let me know when you are able to deliver nationwide,5,Yolkin
"omggggg can't say any better words about this place!! amazing, that's it. you must come here! icecream are the best flavours you will ever try and the soft serve boba ice cream too !",5,Yolkin
"love, wish more vegan flavours though!",5,Yolkin
nice flavours! tasty ice cream! matcha cookie worth a try!,5,Yolkin
great ice cream. lots of accurate asian flavours.,5,Yolkin
the best & most delicious lychee ice cream ive ever tried!!!,5,Yolkin
fantastic ice cream - milk tea flavour is excellent! can diy ice cream sandwich from macaron or cookie. is quite warm in there though,5,Yolkin
yummy ice cream with macaroons. the matcha oreo flavor is quite good.,5,Yolkin
"i had a hard time choosing which flavour to try, i went for the hong kong tea with condensed milk.woah! it was incredible!the flavour variety here is original and i recommend visiting. my partner is coeliac, so gluten free is essential. they were cool about that and had some great choices.enjoy!",5,Yolkin
love this place and have revisited. delicious ice cream macaroons that are not overly sweet. however they no longer have the pre-made ones so you just build your own. tastes just as good!,5,Yolkin
macaron ice cream sandwich is a good idea but the ice cream texture is not very creamy,3,Yolkin
best ice cream in london. possibly the world! such cool flavours. i'm a big fan of durian,5,Yolkin
such a colourful place! its not all about instaworthy looks they have very unique flavors too,5,Yolkin
delicious ice cream. try with macarons.,5,Yolkin
"place is a bit rundown and there's no loo, but the service and food are nice",3,Yolkin
amazing! great and very tasty ice cream and ice cream sandwiches- you can creat your own. good location and friendly staff.,5,Yolkin
fun concept and good ice cream. however the opening times seem to differ from those mentioned online.,4,Yolkin
the pretty pictures do not reflect the end result. the macarons are not well baked and the ice cream itself is not the best.... not worth the 5,1,Yolkin
delicious ice cream in a calm and welcoming surrounding,5,Yolkin
"seriously good! ice cream is more milky than creamy, but beautifully & freshly flavoured. lovely staff, pretty place. ammmmmazing macaroons. perfect.",5,Yolkin
i was so excited to try their macaroons and it was super yummy! im actually heading there now and cant wait to have more ,5,Yolkin
"really cute little ice cream place with loads of asian inspired flavours to choose from including milo, pandan, pocky etc. nice atmosphere with a few tables to sit at too.",5,Yolkin
my favourite macaroon sandwiches! the best x,5,Yolkin
very underwhelming especially for the price. i saw the raves online so hurried here to have ice cream with chunks of actual ice in it. the ice cream wasn't creamy either. i wish i ate at some of the other shops in the area truthfully.,2,Yolkin
"great service,  friendly staff and nice atmosphere. had their vegan sorbet and that was delicious ",5,Yolkin
fantastic ice cream. a++++,5,Yolkin
incredible pandan icecream and macaron. highly recommend going here!awesome staff too,5,Yolkin
lovely wild variety of ice cream that doesn't disappoint,5,Yolkin
"popped into this ice cream shop while visiting london. macarons were crisp on the outside and chewy in the centre, which made for an enjoyable ice cream sandwich. flavours were great - we tried the matcha oreo, taro, red velvet and egg tart (our favourite of the 4). 5 is a little pricey for an every day treat, but quality was good.",4,Yolkin
if you like macaroons this is the place to go!about 5 different flavours to choose from and you can make your own. each one is roughly 4.50 which i thought was reasonable. it's filling and yummy. it's only a small place and so there is limited stock. i went on a sunday at around 4pm and there wasn't much left to choose from.,4,Yolkin
"lovely little ice cream shop with asian-inspired flavours. the ice cream sandwiches were delicious, the brownies were especially scrumptious. maybe could use a little more variety of ice cream flavours, but its asian inspired and theyre not huge on sugary things, awesome nonetheless.",4,Yolkin
very cool flavors like pandan coconut and vietnamese ice coffee!,5,Yolkin
"wonderful ice cream store. it's in a great location, where it is close enough to the action, but not so close that it's swarming with tourists. the desserts are out of this world, and are well worth the money you pay for them.",5,Yolkin
nice little treat...nice ice cream idea but is expensive and ice cream wasn't as smooth as i was expecting for the price.  tried the lemon meringue which wasn't too sweet.,4,Yolkin
"i was visiting from the us and had seen this place on a list of insta-worthy stops. definitely a gorgeous photo, but the ice cream sandwich with macarons and lucky charms ""milk"" was maybe even more delicious than it looks! it's huge, so i'd recommend sharing with a friend. sad i don't have something like this more local to me!",5,Yolkin
"really good ice cream enjoyed the novelty of it as well as the high class finish. however, you do have to pay a pretty penny for the experience and so next time i will be having a 99 flake!",3,Yolkin
would recommend the brownie and raspberry macaron sandwiches.,4,Yolkin
absolutely love this cute little store! i have been countless times as they change the flavours regularly. love the ice cream macarons and the unique flavours.,5,Yolkin
brownie ice cream sandwich with a scoop of coconut matcha - the brownies were really good but the coconut ice cream was ok. it's pricy and by the time we went there (around 3 oclock) the special ice cream sandwiches were almost already gone.,3,Yolkin
the flavour variety here is original and i recommend visiting.,4,Yolkin
"very cute atmosphere with amazing food and service, rated the bts songs!",5,Yolkin
from the days that yolkin would just have pop up shops to now. it has always been good. love the variety and create your own from the macaron ice cream sandwiches. the brownie was a perfect combination with the viet coffee ice cream,5,Yolkin
yummy treat! i tried the smores ice cream sandwich and my partner had the coconut (thai style i think it was) they were both delicious and not overly sweet so i could actually enjoy it fully. the macroon is is a great substitute for cookies for an ice-cream sandwich! and great for anyone who is gluten free ,4,Yolkin
best place to go for ice cream on a sunny day with flavors you won't see anywhere else.,4,Yolkin
"first time visitor, was recommended this place by my girlfriend. wow the ice-cream filled macarons are incredible. next time i'm in london i'll make a detour and go back ",5,Yolkin
"absolutely amazing macaroon ice cream sandwiches! me and my sister were visiting london from canada and were blown away by these ice cream sandwiches. they are so unique and so delicious, the macaroons are delightful and the ice cream is also delicious. these are a must try if you are in london!",5,Yolkin
special ice cream flavour,5,Yolkin
such a colourful place! its not all about instaworthy looks they have very unique flavors too.,4,Yolkin
i don't know of any other places like it. it's a good place to go for a treat. i would go for the flavours you wouldn't typically find elsewhere,4,Yolkin
interesting and tasty ice cream flavors. staff is adorable and the shop is lovely!,5,Yolkin
"one of the best ice cream parlours in london, would go everyday if possible",5,Yolkin
"cute little ice cream store, big portions. nice quiet store, can be annoying when you're trying to get past several instagram photos being taken. staff are lovely.",5,Yolkin
i think id definitely go back to try the ice cream on its own. this rose water flavoured macaroon sandwich was good but not a favourite. very friendly staff and pretty cosy. very pretty designs and selection of flavours. reasonably priced compared to other deserts places. will visit again soon.,4,Yolkin
ice cream tasted great,4,Yolkin
highly recommend the boba soft serve!,5,Yolkin
heavy hong kong flavour influenced homemade ice creams well worth trying. my favourite was the hk tea flavoured ice cream but the egg custard tart was interesting with flakes of pastry.,4,Yolkin
great atmosphere and great music played in the store. best place to go for ice cream on a sunny day (or any day) with flavours you won't see anywhere else.,5,Yolkin
everything is pretty in design. flavors were better than average for ice cream. macaroon was average. not like laudure macaroons (but of course i didnt expect that). its more for looks here.,3,Yolkin
"love the ice cream, i got the red velvet flavor. it was delicious. it worth to break your diet for ",5,Yolkin
the ice creams are amazing! staff are very friendly! definitely come try out their ice creams!!,5,Yolkin
"pricy (as expected) but the hk milk tea + hollicks ice cream was probably the best ive had in london! around 4 for two scoops, its enough to share for two people. the macaroon ice creams ran out but i went quite late",5,Yolkin
lovely independent ice cream store.,5,Yolkin
"a new concept of ice-cream sandwiched into macaron which both were delicious but not very practical when it comes to eating it. gets all clumsy, but nice attempt.",3,Yolkin
"it's a nice concept, was expecting the store to be more inviting but to be fair they are refurbishing. i would say, if you are in the neighbourhood definitely try it but dont travel across town for it. very pricy, so more something i would try once.",3,Yolkin
very tasty ice cream with macaron,5,Yolkin
nice macarons and great ice cream,5,Yolkin
"i've been warning to try the ice cream macrons here for a while and they are pretty damn good, wish there were more flavours on offer as none of them stood out to me as great and i was desperate for a matcha flavoured one.",4,Yolkin
absolutely amazing flavors. plus i personally really like the window spot - perfect spot to have ice cream.,5,Yolkin
"strange but delicious ice cream flavors. you can get it either sandwiched, or in con, cup of different sizes. also you can taste the flavors before you buy.",4,Yolkin
been coming to this place for forever amazing food very well priced would come here every day if i lived closer!!!,5,Young Cheng
"the best value for money restaurant we found in london. you have unlimited refills on a big variety asian buffet and everything is tasty. prices are 10,50 if you stay in and cheaper for takeaway.worth it!",5,Young Cheng
dessert  food ,4,Young Cheng
food was fine but it is very hard to access the buffets.,3,Young Cheng
nice food very good taste and sort of friendly stad,5,Young Cheng
i visit with my family and her friendsthe foods was ok that chinese style dim sum is fine not to very  but some of them foods is nice duck tongue and not to expensive.,3,Young Cheng
the menu in chinese is a hidden gem. great food and reasonably priced.,4,Young Cheng
good experience. a bit too small but the food was good.,5,Young Cheng
this place is not recommended at all. food was cold and dry,1,Young Cheng
food are good. i am from hk. food are almost as good as food in hk. free dessert was served. overall everything is fine,4,Young Cheng
"food is alright. love the dim sum, however, the roast duck was served a bit of cold which i believe affected the taste.",3,Young Cheng
pricy,3,Young Cheng
very good place for authentic cantonese food. my regular restaurant visit everytime i am in london,5,Young Cheng
best for dim sums in soho because that is the case can get very busy,4,Young Cheng
this for me has always been one of the go-to chinese restaurants in chinatown. my family and i have been frequent customers and the food has always been great and tasty. the prices are more acceptable than a majority of the restaurants down the main street (gerrard street).,5,Young Cheng
the waiters were very rude and did not address us properly. they got the order of my food wrong and delayed their service. the waitress then had the audacity to ask for a tip!! overall never again!!,1,Young Cheng
decent chinese food in china town coming from an asian. definitely a local place for dim sum and comparatively cheaper than other restaurants in china town. going in the morning for dim sum is recommended,4,Young Cheng
"large portions, mediocre quality, poor value for money. chicken is terrible quality. if the menu was 30% cheaper it would have felt fair.",2,Young Cheng
"really lovely attentive service, good food",5,Young Cheng
"friendly staff and great service. do not expect english waitering though, they express their hospitality here differently. reliable dim sum and cantonese dishes at reasonable prices.",4,Young Cheng
tasty frog legs with pepper. vietnamese spring rolls and octopus in spicy sauce are also great dim sum,4,Young Cheng
"favourite place for dumplings! (even though i'm not a dumpling expert)but it seems very reasonably priced and portions are huge.don't expect much from the service. it's a fast paced restaurant which just gets things done. no extras, no niceness.oh, 10% off if you pay cash!",4,Young Cheng
food is great but the service just feels weird. definitely worth going for the food. just the service cuts it short of 5 stars,4,Young Cheng
lovely place to eat best beef curry i have had in a long time,4,Young Cheng
amazing dim sum and very generous portions. very fair pricing too. don't miss out!,5,Young Cheng
"came here twice now, the food is lovely, quite a lot of choices :) staff is alright",5,Young Cheng
disgusting food! dry! not labelled correctly! really greasy! staffs attitude is very poor. would not recommend eating here!,1,Young Cheng
"poor food, little choice, very oily, worst wings, worst chow meing, worst duck. food was very bland, very disappointed. staff rushed us to eat, very little hospitality. did not feel comfortable at all. you dont have to listen to me but if i were you i would spend my money at a restaurant elsewhere.",1,Young Cheng
not as so good as normal. still 4 star to give them chance for next time ... hope quality is not an issue. see next time..,4,Young Cheng
great food. fast service. try the peking duck and black tea,5,Young Cheng
"terrible service, miserable staff who serve like they hate you and act like youve offended them when you ask for water. food gave me food poisoning, terrible bland garbage. do not go here. even mcdonalds has better service and food.",1,Young Cheng
amazing chinese good.would recommend.,5,Young Cheng
friendly service left alone to make decision instead of hovering with notebook..food tasty left feeling full ...,3,Young Cheng
"my favourites were the siew mai, prawn cheong fun and stir fried radish cake. service was kind of lackluster, we ordered two plates egg tarts but the 2nd plate took forever to arrive despite our asking them three times about it",4,Young Cheng
very nice banquet meal for four.,5,Young Cheng
splendid food!,5,Young Cheng
great value authentic dim sum. always efficient service and excellent quality food. top tip - lift the lid of your tea pot and leave askew for a top up of hot water. ,5,Young Cheng
"very kind staff, small but complete, the broccoli perfectly cooked, and the noodles...omg loved it. very cheap. if you are fit or so fancy this is not your place, here you could eat (really) good food with your budget.",5,Young Cheng
good dining experience and good value for money on the lunch menu.,4,Young Cheng
"cosy restaurant, with tasty food. went on chinese new year weekend and although it was busy still was served quickly and food was great. the bbq meat were particularly good here !!",5,Young Cheng
please do not go there it is horrible hooorrible rude staff very rude,1,Young Cheng
the worst chinese food we've ever had! this has nothing to do with real chinese kitchen! the waitress ignored our complaint...,1,Young Cheng
"had the buffet on sunday night after a little day it out in london. food was decent and price not bad, also staff were friendly and helpful. would recommend.",4,Young Cheng
great food and service. really liked the duck!great selection of veggie options too.,5,Young Cheng
faultless dim sum . xiao long bai better than the fancy places. staff quite old school but also quite lovely.,5,Young Cheng
"for the tea the 1 star but only because i have to give a star. worst food in london. service was a joke, they even lacked respect for their customers.",1,Young Cheng
the food was good however the service let it all down so much and it smelt like cat,1,Young Cheng
we always return here - always lots of chinese customers so  you'd think it'd be good. food ok. service bearable,3,Young Cheng
"very nice food. i had a very nice dining experience. would go again. it's cheap, it's good food and the fact that it's cash only didn't bother me at all.",4,Young Cheng
fantastic meal. the chicken and black bean sauce is the best around,5,Young Cheng
"food was great, especially the dim sum and plenty of non-standard menu items to try. warning though the portion sizes are massive.",4,Young Cheng
they short changed us and would not admit their mistake. thieves. please avoid this restaurant that actually does theft.,1,Young Cheng
"the absolute worst customer service i have ever received in my life. princess leia would probably get better service on the death star, if darth vader waited on her.",1,Young Cheng
"the restaurant that i always go to with my family. must try their lobster with ginger and spring onion! also their scallops!i note that some reviews have mentioned that they had buffet food, and therefore rated 1 star. they must have this restaurant confused with another, young cheng are definitely not a buffet restaurant.",5,Young Cheng
"price raised, no longer inexpensive, food standard also has decreased, no longer automatic 1st choice.",4,Young Cheng
"worst restaurant i've been to in london, service was horrendous, had to wait twenty minutes to pay the bill, then was ok for the price, service charge was a complete joke!! -5 rating",1,Young Cheng
"good ginger spring onion lobster. dim sum also fair, above average. good prawn dim sum. we found service to be fine. fairly priced too.",4,Young Cheng
my regular and favourite dim sum restaurant in london. the interior is not fancy looking but the food is very authentic and reasonably priced!,5,Young Cheng
"i love this place!cheap excellent dim sum (lunch only) the tea is bottomless and i recommend the shrimp and char siu bao fluffy dumplings with their hot and sour soup. get there at 12 noon on weekends, they fill up fast although they have two levels of seating.",5,Young Cheng
"the best value and tastiest dim sum in the area i'd say, just don't expect friendly service",4,Young Cheng
"pretty fair dim sum for a low price. the trade off is atrociously rude service.  lower your expectations, try not to to take things personally and enjoy some nice dumplings.",3,Young Cheng
nice and cheap. good food,4,Young Cheng
a very good and popular chinese restaurant.,4,Young Cheng
food tastes terrible,1,Young Cheng
"i have to say the staff were extremely rude and  unprofessional, just because the restaurant is gonna be sold soon. the manager even ask the customer not to come back any more. the staff wont serve the customers politely. what a poor job they did!",1,Young Cheng
"the food at this place is fabulous. it tastes so authentic and that's what makes the difference. there's a wide choice on the menu to choose from, service isn't bad. it's a bit of a small place with seating on 2 floors. in busy times expect to queue but well worth the wait!",5,Young Cheng
"enjoyed the dim sum very much, so delicious and affordable!",5,Young Cheng
best value for money dim sum in london,5,Young Cheng
"nice food, but most grumpy people ever...",2,Young Cheng
"there are always loads of chinese people dining here, which for a chinese restaurant can only be a good sign! ever good value - top food at reasonable prices, with a vibrant atmosphere. highly recommended.",5,Young Cheng
"for the most authentic chinese food, this place does not disappoint. wonton noodles soup is massive for the price. avoid lunchtime rush though if you want to walk in without waiting.",5,Young Cheng
cheap and cheerful - wouldnt be an authentic chinatown restaurant without slightly rude servers either!,4,Young Cheng
"went there with my hubby as part of our romantic weekend away from our children. the food was good, its the only reason i am giving it 2 stars. but the service was so bad that we felt like we were not welcome there. we left as quickly as we finished our first order. we end up having to go to another place for another meal.",2,Young Cheng
"surly, uninterested staff, with the young ones message on their mobile phones, rather then being attentive between serving dishes to the table. the older supervisors, apathetic in the main i find but the food perfectly adequate.",1,Young Cheng
"good food, always crowded and waiting for table. waiters serve food quickly hoping customers to finish eating quick and have table ready for next customers!",4,Young Cheng
the cleanest chinese restaurant! plates and cutlery so clean. also staff proper dressed and tidy. food was also very tasty good value for the money. i have been looking for a long time for a clean rest in china town and i really recommend  this one. thank you!,5,Young Cheng
good place for good value plate rice with bbq meats and authentic  dim sum  staff can do with a bit more smiling very busy as prices are lower than surrounding  chinese eateries.  will come again,4,Young Cheng
"i could get a better meal out of a tin of whiskers. when the bill come my partner refused to pay the service charge because the meal was so bad  the staff couldn't even understand what we were ordering. pathetic restaurant,  pathetic staff,  pathetic food.",1,Young Cheng
"it's used to be good, but now is operating under different management, the quality of food is not as good.",3,Young Cheng
"visiting london chinatown for the first time and randomly selected this restaurant. as a taiwanese, the food is delicious. the special fried rice () is surprisingly light(not greasy) but flavorful. cheap eat in london. i remove a star for the service.",4,Young Cheng
a nice little order dim sum...clean and full of hungry folks,4,Young Cheng
pretty average chinese rest off the main area of gerard street,3,Young Cheng
"this is my ""go to"" dim sum place in chinatown. been to many, but always gravitate back here. service is what you'd expect in this type of place, but food is good and reasonable value. have recommended to many who have not been disappointed.",4,Young Cheng
"dim sum was excellent, nice staff and keenly priced too.",5,Young Cheng
great food,5,Young Cheng
"very bad service. waiter/waitress had no manners at all. will not recommend this restaurant. theres one sentence in chinese means dogs eyes look down others, like how they look their customers :) wouldnt give any tips for this kind of service!!! do not waste your time and money for these kind of services. its not that cheap tho.",1,Young Cheng
"ate okay but besides one lady, the service was bad.. they came to collect the money of the bill while 2 persons were still eating & couldnt even say thank you when receiving the money... not okay",2,Young Cheng
lobster is great here,5,Young Cheng
"the food is great a very reasonable prices. i ordered the sweet and sour chicken and the crystal prawn dumplings every time i've been there. i highly recommend both of the dishes, but the service could improve.",4,Young Cheng
do not waste your money i didn't want to even give 1 star. we were taken downstairs with less choice of food what was there was cold and tasteless. the staff were very rude and practically threw our drinks at our table. save your money   very very poor quality,1,Young Cheng
reasonable dim sum,4,Young Cheng
great dim sum served till 5pm,4,Young Cheng
"excellent dim sum, very enjoyable",4,Young Cheng
amazing dim sum (lunch),5,Young Cheng
my sons absolutely hate chinese food. my family wanted to eat here and we were refused. the man said that we had to pay for the boys even if they are not eating! absolutely disgusting! they lost out on 50 because they thought we were going to feed the boys from our plate. shame on them.,1,Young Cheng
"good food, all you can eat, nothing to complain about the food from me... just that the hand drier was not working ",4,Young Cheng
unassuming outside and inside but very satisfied with food. busy for midweek lunch (queued for about 10 mins). restaurant has 2 levels. what appeared to be chinatown locals eating there is a good sign. will be back next time i'm in chinatown.,4,Young Cheng
omg lobster at a reasonable price yummy,5,Young Cheng
lovely dim sum and great service as usual,5,Young Cheng
we could not use the karaoke and the waiter was rude,2,Young Cheng

food quality really bad ! sorry,1,Young Cheng
friendly small restaurant good food,3,Young Cheng
for quick noodle soup and some dim sum look no further. lunch menu is great for a quick lunch and dinner menu is also ok as they serve nice sea bass with some dim sum dishes,4,Young Cheng
"food was a bit bland and took a while to come but we were a group of 16 people, i'm sure it's much quicker in smaller groups",3,Young Cheng
very good  testy  food...enjoyable unpretentious  chinese  resto...family   happily  eating out  ..value for money  all the  way..,4,Young Cheng

delicious roast pork and duck,4,Young Cheng
walked past here and gave it a random try and was not disappointed. very good quality of food and dim sums for the price. would recommend for a quick nice meal. i would happily go again.,5,Young Cheng
one of the staff was very racist and started yelling in front of everyone when we asked for some white sugar. he was mocking and insulting us asking if we need green sugar or red sugar as well and finally never gave us anything. very racist is what i felt.,1,Young Cheng
"one of the best value vs taste in china town. we have been visiting for 20 years, and never disappointed. dim sum and noodle / rice dishes always delicious. space a little crowded. dim sum is to a high standard even compared with restaurants in hong kong.",5,Young Cheng
the dimsum were really delicious especially these steamed ones on the list with shrimps. the skin is very thin and crystal clear you can see the ingredients inside.the service was not good i waited 10mins then someone came to my desk to take the order however all dimsum came on the table was hot!,4,Young Cheng
fresh crab with noodles. .exciting and yummy.,4,Young Cheng
if i could give 0star which its i will. the service was extremely terrible. staff was very unfriendly and rude. food was disgusting greasy and tasteless. it cause reactions to me after 30 minutes. never gonna eat there again not recommending this restaurant,1,Young Cheng
we have a late sunday lunch with teenages there. the food quality is good for their price. (9 dishes of dim sum plus fried beef rice noodle in soy sauce for 46) the staff has asked if we have any allergy when taking order. quite considerate. i'll certainly come back again.,5,Young Cheng

"fab lobster, amazing meal",5,Young Cheng
always good cantonese cooking in nondescript setting.,4,Young Cheng

had takeout from here twice and its definitely on par! fairly fast and efficient service. havent tried their dimsum yet but will do as soon as i get the chance.,5,Young Cheng
"on the sunday, i went it was very busy. the food was very good ",4,Young Cheng

decent chinese food at reasonable prices ,3,Young Cheng
avoid this place. the only good dish was the slice of orange at the end. service - probably the worst in london. never again!,1,Young Cheng

"fast service, very good lobster.",5,Young Cheng
"valuable, especially for the crab noddle. good cantonese restaurant ",4,Young Cheng
"this is a great hidden gem for dim sum. it's just as good, and better in most cases, than even some dim sum places in hong kong. just remember that dim sum isn't served all day, i think they stop serving it at 4pm or something similar (which is actually later than most places as dim sum is usually served at lunch only).",5,Young Cheng
prices very reasonable sweet and sour rib especially good and the crab with noodle is very good. the oyster with hot plate is a bit disappointed as the the oyster is small and look like the dry oyster but not fresh oyster.,4,Young Cheng
"i have never visited this place but if the allegations of discriminatory or racist behaviour is anything to go by, then this must be thoroughly investigated by the appropriate authorities. this country has gone past this sort of small mindedness and racism of any sort, covert or otherwise is simply unacceptable.",1,Young Cheng

nice one in chinatown,5,Young Cheng
"decent dim sum, not the best in  london. i would class it as distinctly average, 3/5 stars.what gets me to 4 stars is that it is insanely cheap! you can get very full for less than a tenner per person, which is almost unheard of for dim sum in london.",4,Young Cheng

"like most other chinatown restaurants, the service is brusque and almost to the point of rude. ignoring that, this place offers some of the best dim sum and food available in chinatown. well worth getting here early! ",4,Young Cheng
amazing dim sum. come with three people so you can have as many different ones as possible. good value. ,5,Young Cheng
favorite restaurant in chinatown. great range of delicious and authentic dishes at decent prices. peking duck is a winner and service is standard for chinese restaurants,5,Young Cheng

"the food here were hot and  delicious, the service was fast and the bill was inexpensive.",5,Young Cheng
"a busy place, seemed to be more for the locals, which suits me. my first menu was chinese only.... but they brought me an english one when i asked. the food was fresh and tasty, service quick and i loved the bustling, very chinese, atmosphere.",4,Young Cheng
"food still have its quality, but service is so bad, could compare to wang kei.... ",2,Young Cheng
dim sum and cantonese dishes excellent value,4,Young Cheng
the best dim sum in chinatown. decent a la carte menu as well although i'd definitely recommend the dim sum more. ,5,Young Cheng
went there to try the lobster noodles. wasn't as awesome as other people have suggested. not amazing and not a lot of lobster meat,2,Young Cheng
"i'm from the states so i know bad chinese food, but this really takes the cake",1,Young Cheng
"slow service, poor hygiene, did not get what we ordered but charged for it. argued when we would not pay  service charge. quality of ingredients very poor. anywhere is better.",1,Young Cheng
always a winner. might not be award winning but for the price of dim sum they're charging you couldn't be happier with it. it's delicious and cheap.,5,Young Cheng
