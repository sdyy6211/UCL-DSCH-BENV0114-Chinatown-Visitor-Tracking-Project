4,Pho & Bun,The food here is delicious but it’s a little tight in space. A woman at the table next to me knocked her glass of water and I ended up with a soaking wet leg. Staff could also be a little more attentive - it was difficult to get another drink and ask for the bill. 10/10 for food though

Very cool-looking place, but unfortunately on a busy night tends to be way too full and the music is extremely loud. Kind of takes away all the fun. Should probably try when it's a bit quieter and you can actually move around to explore all the hidden corners."

The atmosphere was fantastic, quiet and intimate. 
The food was mediocre, and the tasting menu was put together with little thought.
£115 for two.

5,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown,"Come here for authentic milk and fruit teas.

Their signatures are the best - milk tea with pearls and fruit teas are all winners. Love that the teas are sourced and all the recipes of milk/fruit teas have their unique flavours. 

Never been disappointed with the quality. Definitely recommend!"
3,Yifang Fruit Tea Chinatown,Basic

Me and my sister were visiting London from Canada and were blown away by these ice cream sandwiches. They are so unique and so delicious, the macaroons are delightful and the ice cream is also delicious. These are a must try if you are in London!"
3,Yolkin,Brownie ice cream sandwich with a scoop of coconut matcha - the brownies were really good but the coconut ice cream was ok. It's pricy and by the time we went there (around 3 oclock) the special ice cream sandwiches were almost already gone.
